It’s not only an online marketplace for second-hand fashion, but also a way for brands to prove their commitment to durability. Flea markets can be treasure chests – or loads of rubbish you wouldn’t take home even if someone paid you to. That’s what makes rifling through the tables time-intensive, and if parents of small children lack something it’s often extra hours in the day. Emmy Store is also a place for brands to gain visibility – and show off the durability of their products. Both being parents,   and   wanted to come up with a more convenient solution for buying and selling high-quality second-hand clothing. Just being online doesn’t really solve the problem: although social media is full of second-hand sales, buying and selling stuff from and to different people also means high postage costs and several trips to the post office with no legal consumer protection. “Our aim was to build an online store for second-hand clothing that would function just like the ones for new clothes,” Autio explains.  was launched in January 2015 with around 500 items in its selection – all gathered from the wardrobes of the founders and their friends and family. The company wasn’t selling just anything, however, as a core part of its ideology is not to sell fast fashion and instead focus on high-quality clothes made to last. All clothes that are shipped to Emmy’s headquarters in Lohja, either by post or through collection boxes in shops and department stores in Finland and Estonia, are individually and manually examined, photographed and priced, and stored by the team. According to Autio, there are about 80 000 items available, which is a pretty big leap from the initial 500. The idea for Emmy Store stems from the personal experiences of its founders Hanna Autio (pictured) and Markus Rautopuro. When an order comes in, the team sends the product – shipping is currently available to most of Europe – and the original seller gets a percentage of the price depending on the value of the item. As everything is quality-checked, clients have a 14-day right to return their purchase. All this ensures that sellers can expect to get a fair price for their items and buyers will get well-kept stuff that will last them long enough for their investment to be worthwhile. “We focus on high quality and want to partner with sustainably and ethically aware companies,” Autio tells. “In our four years of existence, we’ve really seen that the industry is taking steps in a better direction, with brands becoming increasingly interested in the resale value of their products and consumers considering it as part of their purchase decision.” In addition to the financial savings that come with buying quality goods second-hand, there are significant time savings: the entire selection can be glanced through on one site and purchases are dealt with by just one party, not various sellers. For fashion companies, working with Emmy is a way to show commitment to durability. Several Finnish companies have already jumped on board: for example,  ,   and Reima offer people reselling their clothes on Emmy a chance to receive their share of the proceeds in gift cards, the monetary value of which is higher than the share itself. They also use Emmy to sell items that have a fault that doesn’t affect the overall quality, such as a colour error. There are about 80 000 items available. The situation sounds like a win-win for everyone: Emmy, the partnering brands, sellers and buyers. “It really is that,” Autio confirms, “and it helps brands to activate their clients, showing that buying from them is a sustainable choice and makes financial sense.” Next up for the company is to increase presence and grow the network of partners both in Finland and abroad. Autio tells that there are plans to localise the site to other Nordic markets and later possibly further as well. “Brands are also active in throwing ideas our way. We’ve got some exciting things ahead with our partners that have never been seen in the market before.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tick-bite-tezted-knows-if-you-need-to-worry/,Tick bite? Tezted knows if you need to worry,"Ticks are a growing problem worldwide. These tiny creatures can carry a plethora of diseases which are easily left undiagnosed. This is why Finnish diagnostics startup Tezted is creating a buzz.  For a tiny creature, ticks can cause a lot of trouble. According to  , three million people in 80 countries suffer from diseases caused by tick bites every year. Despite this, Lyme disease (or borreliosis) is the only well-known tick-borne illness that is widely tested for, and this is creating a problem. “Our study, published in the   in 2018, showed for the first time that 85 per cent of patients who suffer from Lyme disease may also have other microbes, such as viruses and bacteria, associated with tick-borne diseases,” says  , co-founder and technology development director at  . “So why aren’t we testing individuals with a tick-bite for other microbes than Borrelia?” The answer is most current diagnostic tools only test for one bacteria or virus at a time and carrying out several tests on an individual can be time-consuming and expensive. In response, Tezted has come up with a solution: a single diagnostic tool, called Tickplex, which can detect 20 different microbes associated with tick-borne diseases. This means less time spent on performing tests and waiting for results, as well as cost savings of 90 per cent, according to Tezted. “Replacing multiple tests with just one also shortens the time for a patient to get the appropriate treatment from their doctor,” Garg enthuses. “That is very important.” The Tezted team (left to right): Suvi Marjakangas, Tapio Rantapirkola, Kunal Garg, Dr. Leona Gilbert, Dr. Jouni Toivola and Jaana Tikkanen. Tezted stems from academic research. The idea for a single test for multiple microbes came from Dr.  , CEO at Tezted, who has worked in the field of autoimmune diseases for over 20 years. Garg joined Gilbert’s research team at the University of Jyväskylä, Central Finland, in 2014. But it wasn’t until the duo successfully applied for project funding from Business Finland that they realised the commercial potential of their work. “By autumn 2016, we had to decide if the best idea was to patent our diagnostics technology and sell the patent, license the patent or start a new company,” Garg recalls. “All results indicated that a new company was needed in this area.” Once the decision was made, the momentum came quickly. Today, Tezted has a six-member team in Jyväskylä and its test kits are already used by laboratories in Germany and the Netherlands. The company aims to have its tests available across the Nordics and Baltics by autumn 2019. “At the moment, the main markets for us are Europe and North America,” says Garg. “Once we have a good record in Western countries, we will pursue similar opportunities in Asia. Tick-borne diseases are present in Asian countries, but the issue isn’t widely acknowledged. So that is going to be a different kind of a battle.” New markets aren’t Tezted’s only focus. Further down the road, the company is keen to modernise the way complex diseases are diagnosed. Garg, who was named Finland’s Young Entrepreneur Researcher of 2018, is motivated by the challenge: “The big goal for us is to have an integrated approach for developing diagnostic tools together with healthcare providers. An integrated approach is still missing for a multiplex and multifunctional test like ours. It will lead to a better understanding of numerous test results and drive personalised treatment for the patients.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/yeply-switches-gears-for-bicycle-servicing/,Yeply switches gears for bicycle servicing,"Don’t have time to service your bicycle? A new Finnish mobile bike repair shop brings the service to your doorstep. It is getting to that time of the year. The weather improves and suddenly everyone remembers their bike is in need of spring maintenance. Cue long queues and service times – if you even manage to get to a bike repair shop. Now Finnish startup   wants to ease this frustration by taking bike servicing directly to customers. “Brick-and-mortar bike repair shops are rarely located close to bike owners and, based on our experience, often prioritise expensive bike models over cheaper mass-market ones,” says  , co-founder and CEO at Yeply. “We started to wonder does servicing your bike really have to be so difficult? We can make it very easy, convenient and fast, and even a fun experience.” The company aims to be Europe’s biggest bike service provider by 2022. The concept is simple: Yeply has transformed vans into mobile service stations. The vans drive around different neighbourhoods, set up for an evening and serve all kinds of bikers and bikes. The service can be pre-booked online or requested ad hoc at the van. Either way, Yeply promises to have your bike ready the same day. “No brick-and-mortar shop can guarantee the same,” Särkkinen enthuses. “We believe in simplicity. We offer one product, a seasonal service. It is easy for any bike owner to purchase, our vans have been tailored for it and all bikes go through the same process.” Yeply is what happens when an engineer and a designer get together. In 2014, Särkkinen and his childhood friend   reconnected when both happened to be training for an Ironman triathlon. A few years later, the old camaraderie turned into a business relationship, when Känsälä brought up the idea of modernising the bike service industry. Särkkinen was easily convinced. “We moved really fast. We developed a minimum viable product in early 2016 and started the service on 5 June,” he recalls. “The aim was to test with one van how the service would be received.” It is safe to say the reception was positive. Two years later, Yeply has three vans operating in the Finnish capital region, over 500 000 euros in funding from private and public sources (including the public funding agency Business Finland) and a new digital platform running behind the scenes. “All global megatrends, urbanisation, environmental friendliness and healthy lifestyles promote cycling. This is a strong motivator for us,” says Tommi Särkkinen (left), pictured with his Yeply co-founder Antti Känsälä. The new platform is a crucial part of Yeply’s operational efficiency. It records every bike, service and customer, and also offers real-time insight on the company’s vans, sales and marketing. “This is a very different approach from traditional brick-and-mortar shops,” says Särkkinen. “We like biking, but we also want to create a profitable business.” Yeply also has plans for rapid growth. In summer 2017, the company drove one of its vans to Germany and the Netherlands to test the local markets. Now the startup is ready to launch in Hamburg, first with its own vans and later with franchises. “We are currently developing our franchising model in Finland,” Särkkinen says. “It is the key to conquering Europe before anyone else.” 
Yeply isn’t the first to offer mobile bike repair services but the startup hasn’t run into anyone quite so ambitious. Unlike man-and-a-van operations and specialist on-demand services, Yeply wants to appeal to the masses. In fact, the company aims to be Europe’s biggest bike service provider by 2022 and believes its Finnish origins offer a trump card. “Finland is an extreme country when it comes to weather. That makes it an ideal location for piloting because, if we can make a mobile bike service work here, we can make it work anywhere,” Särkkinen concludes with a laugh. In a model inspired by ice cream trucks, Yeply’s mobile bike repair shops drive around different neighbourhoods and serve business and consumer customers."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/do-i-know-you-sonja-skibdahl/,Do I know you?,"Finnish singer-songwriter Sonja Skibdahl moved to Sweden when she was a teenager but still holds Finland close to her heart, especially when she performs her own songs. When Sonja Skibdahl sings, joy and melancholy intermingle to form a memorably bittersweet soundscape. This bringing together of seemingly disparate elements has been a mainstay of her career. Born in Espoo, Finland, she moved to southern Sweden as a teenager and set about gently developing a career punctuated by collaborations and performances that stretch as far as Australia, England and the US. This collaborative spirit eventually manifested itself in a three-year project named (Sing With Me). With Skibdahl at the helm, young people with disabilities were given the opportunity to express themselves and develop through the creation of music. Now, after becoming a mother for the first time, she continues to perform in the band Sorgenfri and has also found another musical collaborator in  , with their song   set to be released this year. Yes, I enjoyed the movie, especially all the acting.  , who played Freddie Mercury, was fantastic. He talked and moved like Freddie, and on stage he was like a copy of him. I would have liked to see more, though, more about the music they made, but I understand that there is a time limit in a movie. I guess it depends on the feeling and the mood and who I am working with. For example, I have written many songs based on lyrics by my brother-in-law  , and they are all in Finnish. It also depends on who I am writing the song for. Once I was really angry with someone and, instead of writing an angry text message, I wrote a song in Finnish. The person does not know Finnish. It was more about writing down my frustration than about arguing. I have heard that my voice changes depending on the language that I sing in, something I had not thought about before. I enjoy mixing the languages at my gigs, even when people may not understand a word of what I am singing; then it becomes more about delivering a true feeling with the song. Around creative people because they inspire me so much. Also, at home at the kitchen table when I feel I need to express myself, I write down how I feel, or when I want to tell a little story. When I am sad or low, I can get very creative. It is like having a little therapy session on my own. When the sun is shining and I am really happy, I would rather do gigs, meet friends or do some gardening than sit inside writing music. With my bad sense of direction, I sometimes find it even harder than before to find my way without a GPS. A lot, of course, has happened with construction everywhere, too. Every time I visit Finland it still feels like home to me, even though I sometimes look like a tourist trying to find my way to different places. One thing that has unfortunately not changed since I moved is the attitude among some towards people who speak a language other than Finnish. But I want to point out that this is a statement covering only a minority of people. I do feel that Finland is overall a warm and open-minded country. People still get very surprised about how well I speak Swedish, which is one of my mother tongues. That is one of the biggest misconceptions. I have a new little person to write songs for. The first one I wrote for my daughter,  , was when she was still in my belly, and after that I think I have written two more songs for her. I play a lot of music for her which she seems to enjoy. I hope that she will keep enjoying music as much as I do, and maybe become a songwriter herself one day. If she wants. I love to play at Pride festivals: There is so much joy in the air. It also feels like an important gig because of the statements that all love is equal and that you have the right to be exactly who you want to be. I also enjoyed my gig at a festival in the countryside in the middle of a little forest in Brighton, the UK. There I slept in a tent all by myself, which was scary; but I overcame some of my fear of the darkness, ha-ha. It was a warm and welcoming atmosphere to play in. I enjoy playing at small countryside festivals like Mossagårdsfestivalen here in Skåne. Really dry jokes like “My dog used to chase people on a bike a lot. It got so bad that finally I had to take his bike away.” ,   and  . I know, musicians only, but I feel that these three are my top three musical idols who have inspired me and whose music I have listened to for many years. Imagine how motivated I would get after this dinner! So many new songs and new creative ideas could come out of this. And maybe I would get to do a duet too? Ha-ha. I love working with other people because I get inspired by them and learn a lot from different collaborations. I get out of my little bubble and get to see another point of view. The ups and downs in life give me a lot of material for my songs. The downs used to be the ones that inspired me the most. Love inspires me too, which means that I have written quite many happy songs over the last four years, too. Yes, I am so excited about this upcoming release! Like I mentioned before, I love to collaborate with other musicians and artists because I learn so much from them and it is so much fun to be creative together. The songs that I write by myself get a new dimension when someone else is adding their feeling to it. For example, many of the songs we play with Sorgenfri, the band I play in, I usually write alone until the first draft is ready to be passed over for collaboration. With  , Jonas and I wrote together from scratch. That was something that I really enjoyed doing too. Yes,   is my dream project. We have been writing and recording songs together with students, and now we are filming the music videos. The children have used various methods to co-write their own lyrics. Some of these methods are: pictures, objects, mind maps, depending on the students’ needs and abilities. The style of music, melodies and recordings are based on the students’ ideas and wishes. I have always tried to add music into the jobs that I have had. The idea for this project came about when working for a school for children with special needs. I love to see what a great positive impact music can have on my students. By writing our own songs, we can express our feelings, learn new words, get confidence and knowledge. Keep doing what you are doing by staying a child as long as you can. Bring some of that childishness into your adult self, too, as life will be more fun when you don’t take things too serious. And maybe you should practise playing that guitar more often? We used to have a summer place in Lohja, where we spent all our summers since I was a kid. After selling it, we now sometimes rent a cottage somewhere near a lake with a sauna next to it. The Finnish nature is breathtaking. Where the family and friends are, there I am – and that makes for the best summer."

Streaming has elevated the once-humble TV to the forefront of global consciousness, with production values, storylines and acting reaching heights deemed unimaginable a decade ago. What better time then for this quintet of Finns to rise to the top. What do  ,   and   have in common? They are all voicing the new   TV series, which is set to air in late February in Finland. Local production house   is behind the wheel of what is the most expensive animated series the country has ever produced. Global release rolls out from this spring. “The Moomins are great to work with,” says Gutsy CEO   in our forthcoming feature. “Because work is such a big part of your life, it’s superb to be able to do something you truly believe in.” The Nordic crime genre has proven to be of considerable intrigue internationally, with viewers tuning in to tales of murder and ill intent played out against an icily cool backdrop. Led by a detective duo, this Finnish series is brimming with requisite trauma, misguided religion and furrowed brows. Göteborg Film Festival was one of many to sit up and pay attention, tipping its hat to the series’ screenwriters. “[W]e decided to give the award to the show that in our opinion took the most risks in storytelling and originality in character development,”  . “The winning series showed us a community under pressure and found new ways to deconstruct and play with the crime genre.” For those yet to visit, the part of Finland located north of the Arctic Circle houses some of the most beguiling landscapes the country has to offer. Adding to the gently undulating fells, herds of reindeer and the mystical Northern Lights, illusionist   digs into his bag of tricks for a magical display. “I believe we’ve hit a jackpot, content-wise,”   after the global distribution rights for the series were picked up Hong Kong-based Lightning International. Alright, back to business then – the Nordic crime business, that is. This local series premiered on Netflix in August 2018, following protagonist ’s detective as she dived into a murder case after losing her husband. With Netflix currently available in almost 200 countries, the release represented “the most extensive distribution of a Finnish series or film by a commercial actor to date”,  . These animated birds continue chirping, but their thought bubbles are now being translated into Arabic, after the licensing rights for the children’s series were sold to the world’s biggest Arabic-speaking channel,  .

The chef has championed Italian pizzas in Finland for the past 10 years since moving here from Rome and opening the first   restaurant with his wife,  , in Turku. Where the former focuses on  -style Roman pizzas, Pizzeria Luca focuses on Napolitan artisan pizzas, an approach that earned it the title of the best pizzeria in Northern Europe in the 50 Top Pizza 2018 competition in Italy. Tampere’s new Pizzeria Luca sits by the Frenckell Square in the centre of the Finnish city and offers pizzas with special ingredients from the region, such as locally produced smoked salmon and salmon roe. Two more Lucas can be found in Finland, one in the suburb of Lauttasaari in Helsinki and the other in Zsar Outlet Village in Kymenlaakso. “I believe we have fared well in international comparisons because of our authenticity and passion,” Platania said. “High-quality Italian ingredients and the right flavours are sealed with Italian wines and cocktails.” This same, reliable recipe is thus being transported to Denmark. “The forthcoming Luca in Copenhagen will be run by local experts, who have a solid vision and experience of the region’s restaurant market and customer preferences,” he added.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-award-winning-foods/,Five for Friday: Award-winning foods,"Finnish food and ingredients are leaving taste buds tingling around the world. Ever since former Italian Prime Minister  was left with egg on his face  , Finnish food and ingredients have been enjoying a growing audience of appreciative foodies globally. Here are five prime examples from the past 12 months. Chilli and barbecue brand   tasted international acclaim back in September at the International Flavor Awards in the US for its Cherry & Cola BBQ Sauce. ”Poppamies’ Cherry & Cola sauce was launched in April [2018] and has made waves domestically throughout the long Finnish summer,”  . “The sauce is made for barbecuing, but it works well in other cooking as well, since the taste is derived from actual cherries.” Not content with producing delicious rye bread on a mass scale, Finland’s bakeries have busied themselves with other alternatives. In 2018,  ’s cricket bread won the Bronze Lion in the Sustainable Development Goal section at Cannes Lions, under the Responsible Consumption and Production category With each loaf containing 70 powdered house crickets, the bread made the world sit up and pay attention. “As a major operator in the industry, our actions also set an example for others to follow,”    , managing director of Fazer Bakeries. “Food production has an enormous effect on the environment and society.” Last year, Finnish dairy company Valio’s MiFU strips were named the best new brand at the World Dairy Innovation Awards. The unique product can be used as a substitute for meat or chicken and is best served in a hot meal. “One of the most important tasks of product development was developing a texture that could be pan-fried,”   Valio researcher  . “Creating a good texture and mouth feel, however, wasn’t enough: the product also had to remain the same when heated and be easy to use in food preparation.”  stepped up to the podium on two occasions last year, also taking home the prize in the Unsalted Butter category at the 2018 World Championship Cheese Contest in Wisconsin, the US. The butter was lauded especially for its superior flavour and consistent, high quality. The butter is one of Valio’s most important export products and is used by dairies, bakeries, ice cream makers, food processing companies and other industrial customers in more than 30 countries around the globe. “Valio’s customers and consumers around the world appreciate not only the outstanding taste of Valio butter, but also the fact that it is made from pure, high-quality Finnish milk,”    , the director of international marketing at Valio. “Our butter-making craftsmanship spans beyond a century,” she added. Premium raw honey producer   was awarded at the world’s largest annual food trade show, Gulfood, in February last year. The company was recognised in the Best Health and Wellness category.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/aida-impact-handcrafts-better-beginnings/,AIDA impact handcrafts better beginnings,"Finnish company AIDA impact is aiming for a more inclusive society – in a literally hands-on way. Its accessories are made to last both in terms of quality and style. Unlike a lot of business owners,   is thrilled every time an employee tells her she’s moving on. Not because she’s not happy with their performance – pretty much the exact opposite: Siira wants her company   to be a stepping stone for immigrant women to jump onto the career ladder in Finland. On top of its charitable intentions, AIDA impact aims to become a serious fashion and design brand. “Some want to become entrepreneurs, some nurses,” she explains. “Whatever it is that they want to do next, our aim is to offer them a chance to see their work is appreciated and opportunities to build networks and meet new people.” AIDA impact produces handmade jewellery, designed by Siira, in the company’s workshop in central Helsinki, employing mainly refugee women who struggle to find employment in their new home country. Siira points out that many female refugees, even ones with university degrees, are at risk of being excluded from working life, and landing the first job can be really difficult. However, the founder and CEO emphasises that charitableness isn’t the raison d’être for AIDA impact. “Many of our customers don’t even know about our backstory when they buy the earrings. We want to make stylish, classy and high-quality products, and it’s great that we can simultaneously contribute to social inclusion.” The idea for AIDA impact brewed in Siira’s head during her maternity leave. She had been working in and between corporations and NGOs, and always had a drive for bettering the world. As she was staying at home with her firstborn Sofi, she had the time to ponder over passion projects – the kind of things that normally get buried under the daily hassle. Orders have started coming in from around Europe. “I was thinking about ways to make ‘doing good’ easily accessible and approachable,” she recalls. “I figured that beautiful and trendy items attract clients much more than just giving money to charity.” Siira also noticed that big and showy earrings were in fashion, and she started to look for high-quality materials that could be used in making them. The two things – giving people something they fancied and offering work to those who had a hard time finding it – just naturally came together. “Not everything that has happened has been planned. A lot of things have just fallen into place.” Through  , Siira was able to find her first employees. The first products were sold to friends, but now the company is, in the founder’s words, drowning in orders. The team has grown to a handful of members, and new people are being welcomed at a steady pace. The growing company has also spread its wings internationally, with orders coming in from around Europe. So far, there hasn’t been much time or resources for global marketing, but next year will bring a change to that. Siira believes that the company’s style, as well as philosophy, will appeal to fashionistas pretty much everywhere in the world. The products have also been designed to be easy and affordable to ship. AIDA impact wants to encourage fashion businesses to take a stand on social issues. As the company grows, Siira is planning to expand the range of products as well. For her, the most important things are that the materials are of the highest possible quality and that the items truly are handmade, not something that factories push out in bulk. In short, despite its good cause and ideological background, AIDA impact doesn’t sell anything on the basis of who made it, but the end result itself. “I follow closely what’s happening in the world of fashion, and we create our items ambitiously and as well as we possibly can. We have no intention of losing out to fashion brands.” Siira also believes that companies with a positive social impact will attract more and more customers as people become increasingly fed up with conspicuous consumption and low-quality throwaway goods. “People think about what and why they buy, and taking social issues into account in all respects will become compulsory for businesses, for sure,” tells Siira."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/audiodraft-makes-brands-heard/,Audiodraft makes brands heard,"This Helsinki-based audio branding agency has its sights, and ears, set on the next disruption in company branding. How do you distinguish a brand? What do you think about when someone brings up Nike or Apple? Perhaps the most common answer is the visual logos or slogans. But what do these brands actually sound like? This is exactly the question   has asked companies for the past 10 years. What started as a school project at   back in 2008 is nowadays his co-founded audio branding agency,  . Helping companies develop holistic and unique soundscapes, the agency is ultimately striving to bring audio branding to the level of visual branding. “Thanks to smartphones, content is increasingly consumed through our ears and companies are pondering how their message and identity gets heard in the new reality of two-way engagement with consumers,” says Yli-Hollo. “An average person sees approximately 6 000 brand messages a day. How can a brand differentiate itself in the middle of all that noise?” “We started off from an artist’s point of view, to bring brands and artists together,” explains Teemu Yli-Hollo (right), CEO-rapper of Audiodraft. Audiodraft’s answer is a web-based platform where businesses can analyse, create and manage their audio brand. The platform sources 20 000 freelance artists and sound engineers from 120 countries, each able to take part in fulfilling companies’ orders by submitting their own vision for a particular sound or working towards a whole audio identity in a collaborative way. Given that only 17 per cent of companies have audio brand guidelines, compared to 86 per cent in visual branding, the biggest challenge for companies has always been briefing the sound engineers on their vision of what their brand should sound like. To overcome the hurdle, Audiodraft has developed a brand sound analysis tool for the platform. “We’re able to turn something as subjective as music to hard data that gives the client an overview of their own current audio brand and that of their competitors,” says Yli-Hollo, “Through the analysis, we guide the client’s creative process and enable them to differentiate from their competitors and get their message across in a meaningful way.” What follows is the creation phase. It is a process that involves developing soundscapes for a company’s different service sectors based on the brand analysis, as  . It also consists of optimising messages for all media through which audio is generated in the company’s business – think call centres, office lobbies, events, user interfaces, the works! The final part of audio branding is managing one’s brand. “You can find all created brand assets and attributes on the platform, which will help a client to implement and develop their audio brand in the future as well,” explains Yli-Hollo. Teemu Yli-Hollo (left) and Cameron Murphy, head of production, showing off their award bells at International Sound Awards 2018. Ever had goosebumps watching a film? Audio has a powerful, yet subliminal, influence on an individual’s feelings and memory. Yli-Hollo’s team has been toying around with sound applications to extract a fuller experience out of regular everyday things. One good, do-try-at-home example is when Audiodraft teamed up with Kyrö Distillery Company at Slush Music 2017 to showcase the power of sound with an audio sommelier  . Participants tasted two of Kyrö’s upcoming bitters while listening to custom-made tracks to enhance the bitterness of one and the sweetness of the other drink and better the general enjoyment of both taste palettes. The results turned out a success: the organic and distinct tastes were highlighted and the overall enjoyment was refined. “By paying more attention to what’s happening outside of the glass, we can add value to what’s inside it,” says  , global brand ambassador at Kyrö Distillery Company. The tasting experience didn’t go unnoticed in the audio branding industry. It   at 2018 International Sound Awards. The work done by Audiodraft is not only for companies: the agency created an audio identity for the Swedish football team   and its very first deal was to develop a theme song for a personal brand. Yli-Hollo has a background in the Finnish rap scene and has had the title   punched on his business card since the beginning. Former  spearhead   started as Audiodraft’s advisor from the start and, with his background at Hewlett-Packard, he was able to arrange a sit-down with then-CTO of the American IT company,  . “They did a lot of collaboration with rappers back then and after seeing the title on my business card he asked me to drop a few bars in Finnish,” chuckles Yli-Hollo. “So I did and I’m still not sure whether it was my bars or the company, but we ended up signing a deal and making a theme song for his popular podcast  ” Who knows, maybe personal audio posts or brands will be as common as pictures on social media nowadays. Or maybe we’ll be hitting the bars with custom-made tunes in our ears. How would that sound?"

Thanks to its long-standing expertise, the firm recently won an international award. Infrastructure management is perhaps not known as an industry bursting with innovation. But look a little deeper, and also in this field you’ll find firms that are breaking new ground with forward-looking solutions.  is clearly one of these firms. Last month,   reported that the company’s PEHKO 2012–2025 project   from the International Road Federation (IRF) in Las Vegas. The winning project uses advanced asset management methods and policies that help to increase the lifetime of road pavement and cut down on annual paving costs. The prestigious award, however, is just the most recent milestone in over two decades of Roadscanners fine-tuning its expertise in traffic infrastructure asset management. The firm’s guiding principle is to identify problems early, before they become visible. Roadscanners’ guiding principle is to identify problems early, before they become visible. Roadscanners focuses on early detection of issues for a simple reason: fixing problems is many times cheaper if they are identified early, before the surface condition of a road becomes poor and requires bigger renovations. Moreover, if roads are regularly maintained, driving on them is safer and consumes less fuel. This approach helps Roadscanners to stand out from other firms working in infrastructure management, says  , CEO and president of the company: “Our view is that if you’re fixing a pavement that has visible cracks, you are already late.” Saarenketo says the company specifically aims to identify situations where the pavement would start to crack in the next couple of years. If you intervene at this point, it can save maintenance costs by up to 60 per cent and the new overlay will also be more durable. “It’s a bit like brushing your teeth: if you do it regularly it’s a cheap way to prevent getting holes. But if you let the situation get bad, fixing it becomes much more expensive,” he says. In addition to roads, the company’s tools and services enable the monitoring of the condition of railroads, bridges and airports. During the next 10 to 15 years we’re going to see massive changes in how roads are used, and we need to build new infrastructure that reflects this. Founded in 1998 and based in Rovaniemi, Roadscanners has established itself as a truly global actor in the field of infrastructure management: about 50 per cent of the company’s turnover comes from exports, and it has clients in 60 countries across all continents. (This includes Antarctica; for that market, the firm has developed tools that detect crevasses when driving on glacier.) Two decades is a long time in any industry, but Saarenketo says that compared to many other fields road building and management has evolved surprisingly little. However, the pace of change is certain to accelerate, driven by the rise of smart vehicles and growing ecological awareness. “During the next 10 to 15 years, we’re going to see massive changes in how roads are used, and we need to build new infrastructure that reflects this,” he says. “In addition to maintaining the existing roads, it’s crucial to identify new areas that we need to invest in.” The company is looking specifically at AI and machine learning to prepare for its own future. Saarenketo emphasises that investing in R&D and maintaining high-quality products is something the company very much believes in. “It’s like some musicians who stick to their own thing year after year, and never chase the latest trends or compromise their art’s quality,” he says. “I like to think that we have a similar way of doing things.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/no-no-no-gives-thumbs-up-to-resolving-complaints/,No No No gives thumbs-up to resolving complaints,"This Finnish firm’s fair and transparent alternative to online rating services helps customers hold companies accountable. These days, consumers increasingly turn to social media and online rating platforms when a service or a product has let them down. Yet the outcomes tend to be far from optimal. Too often the issues are never solved, as they may not reach the company in question. And even if firms deal with the complaints, the original one-star reviews tend to stay online and continue hurting the firms’ reputation. This is where   comes in. “Our service fills the gap between consumers and companies: we allow consumers to file their complaints in a way that reaches the companies and also give the companies a fair opportunity to respond,” says founder and CEO  . The secret ingredient is that No No No’s users do not issue ratings when filing complaints but are only able to rate the resolutions of those complaints. “This gives the companies a real incentive to solve the issues,” Timonen says. “Our goal is to create a platform that rewards companies for correcting mistakes,” states Jaakko Timonen. Timonen stresses that ultimately both consumers and companies benefit if problems are dealt with effectively: the consumer’s issue can be resolved, and the company gets to retain the customer and gets a reputation boost as it is seen to be responsive to its customers’ complaints. “It’s entirely natural that mistakes happen. Our goal is to create a platform that rewards companies for correcting mistakes,” he says. “Instead of pointing fingers, we want to endorse companies that truly care for their customers.” The firm has already got on the radar of some major brands: both Ikea and The Home Depot are running a pilot with No No No, where complaints through the service are given prioritised access to the companies’ customer service. Any firm can start using No No No for free. By paying a monthly fee, they also get a licence to use the platform’s reviews, ratings and client testimonials in their marketing. Timonen says that at a later stage No No No will be able to use the ratings data to create analytics and business intelligence services, and highlight companies that have demonstrated that consumers can trust them. As it happens, complaining is a very culture-dependent thing. No No No encountered this early on. “We realised that in Finland, many people feel uncomfortable about complaining to the businesses. Even if they get poor service, they worry that if they complain they will somehow hurt the company’s feelings,” Timonen says. “But in the US, consumers think that they absolutely have the right to complain if they haven’t got what they paid for.” Given that US consumers were also quick to find the platform, No No No is now focusing only on the American market and has an office in both New York and Tampere. Recently it was one of the 10 startups that were selected to an accelerator programme out of more than 300 applicants. “In the US, companies have understood the value of our service much more easily,” Timonen says. “They realise that what this is really about is reputation management.” No No No’s platform is currently in beta, but during the next six months the company aims to both launch the final version and work on identifying its product-market fit. “The key is to have both consumers and companies on the platform.” Timonen says. “It’s the chicken and egg problem – and we have to figure out how to solve it and become a rooster!” The company seeks to eradicate knee-jerk one-star reviews."

Little wonder then that it is a forerunner in healthtech. Being   with   and  , Finland has all it takes for a person to live a healthy life. Besides, Finland boasts one of the most effective healthcare systems in the world, with many companies providing digital solutions to improve healthcare efficiency. Hospitals are also attracting growing numbers of international patients for demanding medical treatments. Some weeks ago,   led a group of journalists from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore to explore Finnish competences in health technologies. Below are some of what we discovered. As one of the biggest hospitals in Europe, the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) is going to be  , which could be offered to international patients through its majority-owned company  . “One advantage of this new treatment is that you don’t need to treat the patient 35 times, but only one to two times,” says  , physician-in-chief and director from HUH Comprehensive Cancer Centre.

Many digital healthcare solutions aim to shorten waiting time for doctors. One example is data management company  , which founded   in cooperation with partners. The first research project is to provide diagnoses based on AI and machine learning in an emergency centre. The neural network can give a best guess based on medical data inserted by doctors, while “doctors can enter diagnoses which teach the system to be more accurate,” describes  , service director of DataChief from Avaintec. “The purpose is to introduce efficiency in the first phase of receiving patients and reduce waiting time in acute situations.” Elsewhere,   provides secure communications for hospitals to enable real-time consultation. “Patients can discuss with doctors before deciding whether they should come to the hospital,” says  , CEO of Ninchat. “Psychological discussion is also used; actually, we noticed that it is easier for men to tell their problems via the chat app.” Founded in 2007 in the Finnish city of Kuopio,   is a company specialised in medication management and pharmacy automation. For instance, HUS Pharmacy has been using its automation technologies for years. “We want to give pharmacy full automation. The benefits are both accuracy and speed.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/safety-always-comes-first-for-klippan/,Safety always comes first for Klippan,"This small Finnish company is one of the global spearheads of safer car journeys for children. Its decades-long experience is acknowledged and appreciated in a growing number of countries. In Spain, people are queuing to get a child safety seat by Finnish company  . Sales, purchases and logistics manager   knows exactly why: “We happen to have an excellent agent,” he tells laughingly. “We always give our agents the liberty to do what they think is best in their respective market, and in Spain, things have been going very well for us.” However, it’s not just a strike of luck. Klippan, founded in 1959 to produce seat belts, has made child seats since 1967. Its decades of experience and Finnish-made products have convinced consumers not just in Spain, but in about two dozen other countries as well. About 80 per cent of the company’s revenue comes from international markets. Our small size is also a strength, as we can be agile and move forward with our product development without unnecessary delays. “After Spain, the biggest countries for us are Finland, France, Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden,” Bäckström lists. “Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Austria are looking promising, too.” Klippan’s seats are tested at the company’s very own test rig in Vantaa, Finland. The rig, where tests can reach speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour, is at the core of Klippan’s research and development. Bäckström tells that the rig, built in 1989, is the only of its kind in Finland, so it’s popular with others, too. For example,   uses it for its own research. “Every year, about 300 tests are conducted at the rig,” Bäckström counts. “It’s of essential importance to us. If we had to travel to Sweden for each little tweak in our product development, that would significantly slow down the process and bring about plenty of extra costs.” One of the reasons for Klippan’s popularity abroad is that it provides rear-facing safety seats. Research shows that this way of travelling is significantly safer in comparison to forward-facing seats. The most important long-term goal for Klippan is to keep its customers happy – and safe. “If the child is faced forward in the car and there’s a crash, the child’s neck will take most of the hit. In a rear-facing seat, the entire body is much better supported,” Bäckström explains. “In the Nordics, this has been the norm for ages already, but elsewhere in Europe it’s nowhere near as common yet.” The record-low birth rates in Finland are one of the reasons Klippan is keen to continue tapping into international markets. On top of existing retailers and partners, there have been small endeavours in China, which would be huge market to tackle for the 15-strong Klippan team. Some efforts are taking place in Germany, and Bäckström also mentions Greece as an interesting destination. The way Klippan heads out to the world is through agents just like the one doing a great job in Spain. Bäckström believes that local professionals have the best knowledge of the market and can adjust their strategies accordingly. “We’re of course not without competitors,” he notes. “We are a very small company and there are plenty of other players in the market that are much bigger than us. However, our small size is also a strength, as we can be agile and move forward with our product development without unnecessary delays.” Klippan’s products aren’t particularly cheap, due to their production taking place in Finland and extensive research and development. Bäckström understands that price is a factor when consumers consider their purchases, but he’s certain people are increasingly willing to pay for safety. After all, there’s no price tag for a healthy child. The company’s test rig in Vantaa is popular among research organisations as well."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/onemind-dogs-teaches-old-humans-new-dog-tricks/,OneMind Dogs teaches old humans new dog tricks,"Finnish company OneMind Dogs wants to show the world how our dogs can best make us happy and how we can make our dogs so, too. How do you train a dog that’s hard of hearing?   co-founder   had been competing in agility – very successfully – with her border collie Tekla, when, in 2003, her furry friend suddenly became deaf. All training having been based on verbal cues, Leinonen had to do one of two things: either give up the hobby completely or find a new way of interacting with Tekla. Puppyhood is the best time to train a dog – and OneMind Dogs makes it fun. For an agility enthusiast, the choice was clear. Now, OneMind Dogs’ co-founder and CEO,  , spends most of her time spreading the word about the dog training method that has evolved from Leinonen and Tekla’s experiences. “With Tekla, Janita noticed that words and voices really didn’t have much to do with dog training at all,” she tells. “If anything, Tekla performed even better without words, so she decided to try the method on her hearing dogs as well, and the same happened with them.” OneMind Dogs is an online service aimed to help dog owners train their pets by doing fun and simple exercises. The core idea of the philosophy is to, like Leinonen did with Tekla, step into the dog’s shoes – or better said, paws – instead of expecting the animal to act like a human. This, Keskievari believes, will lead to happier humans and happier dogs. “  shows that having a dog significantly adds to the owners’ wellbeing. We want to boost that effect.” As happy as our dogs can make us, having problems with them will have the opposite impact on our lives. Many dog owners have the best intentions when teaching their dog, but they may not really know what they’re doing. “For example, something as simple as walking the dog on the street can be difficult if it’s not practised from a very early age,” Keskievari notes. “However, many people don’t start training early enough, and things get a whole lot more difficult as the dog grows older.” The number of people with puppies is growing, and no wonder; dogs make our lives better. This is where OneMind Dogs sees a big business opportunity. The pet industry is ever growing: in the US alone, people spent over   on their pets last year, and the sum is constantly increasing. As more and more people are bitten by the pet bug, the Finnish startup wants to find them early. “We want to promote responsible ownership by helping people out from the very first days with their puppies throughout the dog’s life,” Keskievari explains. “OneMind Dogs is meant to be easy and effortless to use and a lot of fun for both dogs and their owners.” The fee-based subscription service includes training videos and daily practices that aim to prevent possible problems. Although initially the service was targeted at agility dogs, it is now looking to serve anyone planning to have a new puppy. OneMind Dogs was founded in 2012, and the service was launched in November the following year. Throughout its existence, about 70 per cent of its revenue has originated from North America, namely the US and Canada. OneMind Dogs has spent plenty of time researching the market, and the plans for the future are big. Currently the service is available in English and Finnish, but in Asia, for example, there may be immense markets awaiting as having dogs is becoming increasingly popular. Keskievari says that, at some stage, subscribers will be able to purchase live support from OneMind Dogs trainers. There are team members in Finland, the US, Australia, Canada and sometimes in the UK, and soon there’ll be an office in Austin, Texas. “Our goal is to be the leading puppy training provider in the world by 2022,” Keskievari tells. Having raised   in funding in May, the company is well on its way to achieving its goal. Numbers aside, the most important aim is still to make life better for dogs and owners. Keskievari would love to do away with pinch collars and dogs living in cages in family homes. “Many people have dreamy images of what their life will be like with their puppy, but finding the right kind of support can be difficult. We want to push them towards that dream.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/fat-lizard-is-footloose-and-looking-abroad/,Fat Lizard is footloose and looking abroad,"Amidst the current wave of Finnish microbrewing, Fat Lizard is raising eyebrows with its folksy marketing gimmicks and American styled craft beer flavours. Diving into the craft brewing scene might prove difficult for a person more familiar with run-of-the-mill mass-market beers. The countless different types of beer, the varying and complex flavours, and details of the brewing process might seem like a distraction if you’re out and about just looking for a nice cold one. Then again, the familiar mass-produced suds you may have had since you were a teenager might not quite do the trick either, especially with the variety of new quality beer available. So, what resides between the two extremes? Turns out, all you have to do is look for a ’54 Chevy with a green and white lizard logo on it and follow it to its destination. The pickup belongs to  , an Espoo-based Finnish microbrewery that is filling the gap between unchallenging beer and sophisticated artisanal ales. “Our aim is to produce quality beer that’s easy to drink,” explains  , who is in charge of marketing and sales at Fat Lizard. “Whether you’re downing two or ten beers, a good and drinkable beer will taste the same as the very first sip – even the following morning.” The story of Fat Lizard started in 2013, when Kukko and his friends  ,   and   were craving for fresh IPAs in Finland. Koskipää and Ylinen had been brewing hobbyists since the 1990s, and the whole crew had experience from the United States, where their taste buds had been tickled by fresh American hops. “For me the whole hobby of brewing beer is fundamentally based on the fact that, at the time, there were no American styled IPAs in Finland,” says Ylinen, the brewmaster. Shipping beer intercontinentally from the US would hurt the most delicate flavours, so the options were quite limited for the passionate IPA lover. “We had to start doing it ourselves,” he explains. The Chevy is more than a pretty face – it is used weekly to deliver batches of green goodness to thirsty clients. “We’re pretty uncompromising when it comes to beer. We just want to make beer that we love, which is a part of our whole concept. As a simple-minded bunch, we don’t really look at the markets, we rather focus on the beer.” There is a broader do-it-yourself attitude and vibe to Fat Lizard – a characteristic that the founders cherish. “Our idea in the beginning was to make quality beer and have fun doing it,” explains Kukko, “This is more of an adventure than a job.” The uncompromising attitude towards making beer they personally enjoy is visible at the brewery, where Kukko has a story for every single detail of the newly renovated space. Starting out, the guys admit that none of them really had an idea what it means to establish a brewery. However, a mutual passion for just the right beer has driven the quartet forward, while a good sense of humour has helped along the way. The pig-headed approach to please their own taste for American-style beers has taken the quartet from hobbyists to the point that Fat Lizard is trying to keep up with the exploding demand. “In the summer of 2017 we moved into the new premises and doubled our production and thought that we’re good. Well, we ran out of beer again in July,” says Kukko. Fat Lizard was the first in Finland to launch the 360 can, which enables a fuller beer experience for all senses. Each of the 41 beers produced by the brewery has a story behind its name. The rise in demand has not diluted the ambitious focus on quality. Each new brew has to be signed off by all of the founding fathers, and new flavours are cooking in the Otaniemi-based brewlab. Equally importantly, the humour and DIY attitude haven’t faded with success. Fat Lizard has collaborated with Finnish surfers to create the Ankle Slapper Pale Ale and with local rugby players to create a tasty beer to enjoy after a rough game – the Rib Tickler Pale Ale. For the island restaurant Lonna, located off the coast of Helsinki, the guys created a sauna beer called Lonna Saunakalja. There’s even a newly opened   located nearby. Five years, 41 beers and four discontinued day jobs later, the Fat Lizard guys have definitely found the sweet spot in the microbrewing scene and are pushing it towards the masses in their distinct way. So how does the brewery plan on expanding internationally, yet keeping true to its do-it-yourself vibes? Fat Lizard currently exports its beers to Sweden and the founders have been busy touring industry fairs and collaborating with like-minded breweries in other markets, including Germany, Estonia and Denmark. The quartet are looking at the Nordic countries for their next phase of expansion. However, ensuring the quality and freshness of their products is a challenge that must be overcome. “We’re on the lookout for partners that represent the same values as us. Luckily, there are several people we’ve already found mutual ground with,” explains Kukko, “We’re ready to put in the work, but we don’t want to be just another brewery. I don’t think it’s a question of whether our beers will sell, it’s more about finding the right partners with the same philosophy.” After many stories about building a successful brewery and coming up with names for dozens of beers, the only question left to ask is: what’s behind the name Fat Lizard? For the first time during the interview, Kukko and Ylinen fall silent. “Well, there’s actually no story behind the name. Topi drew us a picture of a fat lizard and we thought it was funny.” They both burst into laughter."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/3-friends-brings-out-all-the-flavours/,3 Friends brings out all the flavours,"3 Friends has created the most deliciously over-the-top ice cream recipes out there. How can you make just one spoonful of ice cream include various different flavours? Easy peasy, if you ask   co-founder  . Let’s take their raspberry and white chocolate ice cream as an example. “First you notice the sour raspberry, then the sweet white chocolate ice cream, and only then the bits of white chocolate start melting in your mouth,” he explains. “We’ve deliberately made the ingredients melt at different times to ensure that each individual taste can be properly embraced.” Ice ice baby. Finns consume the most ice cream per capita in Europe. Flavours have been the driving force of 3 Friends, known in Finnish as 3 Kaveria, from the word go. The company was founded by Huotari and his two friends (see where the name came from, huh?)   and   to create ice creams that they themselves want to eat. “Our ice creams are made of natural, real ingredients from scratch, without cutting corners,” Huotari says. “We roast our nuts and prepare our sauces ourselves to make the flavours taste so real that they can be instantly recognised even if you’ve not seen the package.” When Huotari says ‘without cutting corners’, he means it. Last autumn, 3 Friends had already publicly announced the launch of two new flavours. As the date drew nearer, the trio backed out: they weren’t 100 per cent happy with the products yet. “We’d rather pull out than sell something we don’t think is top notch. We want to be able to invite guests for dinner, offer them self-made ice cream and genuinely be able to say that we think it’s incredibly delicious.” The first three flavours, which were blueberry-cardamom, strawberry-vanilla and the aforementioned raspberry-white chocolate, hit the shelves in Finland five years ago. They instantly became a big hit, and the founders had suggestions for new combinations flying in from everywhere. One request was particularly prevalent: 3 Friends were constantly asked to make vegan ice cream. Most importantly, not just any vegan ice cream, but the most over-the-top kind in existence. “It was made clear to us that vegans don’t want yet another carrot-flavoured ice cream,” Huotari notes laughingly. “People often think that vegans eat cucumber and lettuce, so we were told to make the most exaggerated version we could think of.” The trio were friends before they started making ice cream together. Left to right: Heikki Huotari, Ilkka Wikholm and Sauli Saarnisto. Now, the award-winning vegan chocolate-nut-caramel ice cream is the company’s best-selling product. “We hadn’t noticed that such a product wasn’t available in the market. It was only afterwards that we understood how much demand there really was for it.” It sounds a little counter-intuitive that Finns consume the most ice cream per capita in Europe. With the long and chilly winters, one would think that the southern Europeans indulge in the frozen dessert much more than the Nordics. Huotari guesses that the explanation lies, at least partially, in housing. “I realised it when we were doing a course at the ‘ice cream university’ in Italy before setting up 3 Friends,” he recalls. “In Finland, we tend to have summery temperatures indoors all year round, whereas in places like Italy the consumption peaks in the warmest months and the portions are smaller.” This doesn’t mean that all 3 Friends products are eaten in Finland. Some time ago, the company was contacted by a Swede who had tasted the products on a visit to Finland and asked if the friends were keen to test the Swedish market. Now, the ice creams are for sale in more than 100 stores in Sweden under the name  , and the products are available in Germany as well. 3 Friends has grown from a trio to a team of about 20 people, but the principles stay the same as they were when the trio first bought a 299-euro home ice cream maker: corners are still uncut. Even Huotari’s favourite flavour remains unchanged. “Raspberry and white chocolate. I could live on it, and I know a lot of other people who could, too.” Those thinking that vegan ice cream has to be boring will be proven wrong by the range of 3 Friends vegan products."

Why would a regular hiker or for-fun footballer need such high-tech sports gear? For a lot of reasons, believes  , CFO at  . He experienced the benefits of compression socks after a couple of days at a sports fair, where he, instead of doing hat-tricks or climbing walls, was just standing still presenting his import business to visitors. Recently, ZeroPoint landed its first big client in Japan, which is a lucrative market for the company. “After the first two days, my legs were knackered and swollen because I had been on my feet for so long,” he recalls. “On the third day, I wore compression socks, and I could really feel the difference that evening. My feet were much less sore.” The socks, given to him by their creator   from Jyväskylä, Finland, convinced Hintikka that compression isn’t a buzzword but a genuinely good idea for anyone willing to help their body recover from physical exercise. Soon after the fair in 2013, he and his business partner   decided to join forces with Ahonen, who had founded ZeroPoint Compression alone four years earlier. Since then, socks have been accompanied by sleeves, shirts, shorts, tights and jackets. The main target group for ZeroPoint are athletes, but the socks have also been discovered by people who sit and stand still for long periods of time, such as pilots, office workers and recovering patients. “We know that a lot of Finnair pilots choose to wear ZeroPoint socks when flying,” Hintikka reveals. The secret ingredient of compression is blood. As compression wear adds pressure on the body and the walls of the veins, it helps keep circulation going and oxygen flowing to the heart, preventing legs and feet from getting swollen and tired. Jaakko Hintikka experienced ZeroPoint first hand, or leg, before joining the team. “When it comes to athletes, compression helps before, during and after performance,” Hintikka explains. “Like I noticed after the fair, it significantly reduces recovery time.” One proof of this is the fact that the vast majority of sportsmen and women who’ve tested ZeroPoint products want more. The company is the official compression brand partner of the Finnish Olympic team, and it has various collaborations with sports professionals, including snowboarder  . The athletes really do wear the products – not just smile and wave at the camera for a hefty bank transfer. “We always approach them by offering a chance to test our clothes, and pretty much all of them have started using them regularly,” Hintikka tells. On top of boosting the wellbeing of its wearers, ZeroPoint has another ambitious goal. Hintikka names sustainability as one of the key drivers of the company’s innovative process. Most of the products are made of a material known as Econyl yarn, which is nylon regenerated from textile scraps, production discards and industrial plastic, like abandoned fishing nets. “We use recycled materials as much as possible,” Hintikka tells. “We only use other materials to reinforce the features that are needed for optimal compression, but our goal is to eventually be 100 per cent recycled.” Most ZeroPoint products are manufactured in Portugal, using fabric made in Italy. They end up all over the globe, the biggest markets being in the Nordics, the UK, the Benelux countries, Switzerland, Russia and recently Japan. The company is run from both Finland and Sweden, where it has a subsidiary. The plan is to conquer foreign markets one by one, focusing on one region at a time. “Our biggest strength lies in the people who try our products and understand how great they are,” Hintikka notes. “That’s also the most encouraging feedback we can imagine.” Be it from the cockpit, a hospital bed, an office desk – or the Olympics. Most of the products are made of a material known as Econyl yarn, which is regenerated nylon waste from textile scraps, production discards and industrial plastic."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/taiga-delivers-happy-energy-with-arctic-flavours/,Taiga delivers happy energy with Arctic flavours,"Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you are going to get. Open a bar of Taiga, however, and you’re guaranteed to receive a burst of nutrition straight from Finnish forests. Sitting alongside a cluster of globally known energy companies in Vaasa,   delivers its own type of energy: happy energy. Its recipes are a combination of dark chocolate and new flavours that boost the brain’s pleasure centre in a healthy way. “I wanted to create something special and found freeze-dried berries, which I think go perfectly with the dark chocolate,” says  , the founder and mastermind behind Taiga Chocolate. Pictured (left to right) are three of the five co-founders: Tanja-Maria Davidov, Anne Nymark and Mirja Palola (CEO). Nymark started out in 2011 as a one-woman show creating pastries and confectionery in her garage. Eventually she started experimenting with ways to pack in the flavours while maintaining a long shelf life in order to open up new markets abroad. In time, she had perfected a recipe free from nuts, gluten and milk but bursting with natural flavours. Taiga was ready to roll out its first products around a year ago, but from a sales perspective the company was standing at a crossroads. “I remember meeting Anne on an entrepreneur course and she told me that her business had come to a point where it needed new direction,” says the company’s sales director,  . “Together we decided to go full speed ahead and expand the business beyond the local market.” The now five-person team is surrounded with an aura of positivity. But even though laughter is never far away, it is clear that the team is not joking about its plans – Taiga has big dreams and the capacity to realise them. Migrating from the rivers of Lapland to the company of chocolate. Do you dare to taste? The company now focuses solely on chocolate, with its sights set firmly on international markets. Since starting sales in August 2017, the products have become available in selected shops, onboard Finnair’s Asian flights and in an online shop opened in June 2018. Initial encounters with industry people from China, Singapore and Japan also bode well for plans to start exports to Asia by Christmas. “According to research, the consumption of snacks and health awareness are growing rapidly in Asia, and we can combine these demands in our product,” says Davidov. “Freeze-drying is a Finnish innovation that conserves 97 per cent of the berries, so it is almost like picking them straight from the forest.” Davidov strongly believes in the power of visual appeal and views that sprinkling berries atop the chocolate turns each bar into a work of art that showcase what grows up north. Additionally, every package tells the story of the product in seven languages. Taiga’s chocolate bars are currently available in lingonberry, bilberry and sea buckthorn. Furthermore, the company has turned the concept of candy upside down by adding reindeer crumbs and whole dried smelts to the mix. The savoury idea originated in a way that is as crazy as the end result: while standing in line to buy cat food in a pet shop. “I discovered a bag of dried fish and took it with me. In the end, my cat did not like it at all but I did,” Nymark remembers. “Suddenly I realised that this would be quite shocking on top of chocolate.” Unwrapping a bar of chocolate to find fish in a sea of chocolate certainly catches one’s attention. Of course, a product that combines sweet and savoury in such a way has its niche audience and divides opinions. Taiga believes it has potential especially in Asia, where a bag of dried fish is not at all an uncommon snack. The team hints that more extreme flavours can be expected in the future, but also traditional milk chocolate and white chocolate alternatives are in the pipeline. “In five years, I believe that we will have a world-class brand that brings a positive feeling to people worldwide,” says Davidov. “If somebody mentions that they like Taiga that should mean something to the other person, in other words, wonderful chocolate.” Taiga can be eaten with a good conscience, as it’s packed with vitamins and covered in healthy dark chocolate."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-audio-related-innovations/,Five for Friday: Audio-related innovations,"Listen up! These Finnish companies are worth hearing about. Let’s make some noise for this quintet of Finnish innovators exploring sonic possibilities on the global stage. Putting an end to conference monologues, this spongy microphone can be thrown to people in the audience to encourage listeners to participate more than a traditional mic. The core idea was to make the product as simple as possible. “When you throw a Catchbox at someone, they’ve only got a couple of seconds to figure out how it works,” CEO  . “Hence the gadget can’t be too complicated. This independent media startup has launched a new kind of audio listening service: a YouTube for podcasts. “We are not focused on ‘click this and laugh’ content, but more so on stories that might stimulate thinking,” CEO    . “Kieku makes it easier for people to find inspirational and brainy content. Better thinking leads to a better life and better ideas.” Founded in 1978, this company has been making sonic waves ever since with speakers reflecting its focus on reliability, sound quality, design and environmental friendliness. “Today our typical customer is someone who monitors sound and makes sound,” Genelec’s managing director   said   on the company. So, it could be a sound engineer working for a TV, radio, film or music studio or an artist creating music. This very much reflects the makeup of the company itself — most of the staff play musical instruments, making them both musicians and engineers.” This Finnish startup gives prominence to the idea that music can lift our spirits and help us relax by transforming sound into touch. Its augmented audio can be implemented into car seats, theatre seating, furniture and gaming devices, to name but a handful of uses. Many agree. “Our strategic goal is to have multiple licensing partners and over 200 million euros in revenue by 2020,”   CEO   in our feature on the company. “It is an ambitious goal, but our board members consider their calculations conservative and we believe them.” Improving sound quality by creating easy-to-customise, modular acoustic elements for public and commercial spaces is the   of this Finnish company. “Of course, our core focus is acoustics, but besides that the most important factor for us is how a product looks,” CEO and founder    . “We aim to make stylish and easily transformable products which you are not ashamed to put on display in any space.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bjarmia-takes-pride-in-history-and-craftsmanship/,Bjarmia takes pride in history and craftsmanship,"Bjarmia, a Kuusamo-based manufacturer of hand-made ceramics, has struck a balance between its long history, deep-rooted relationship with nature and contemporary design sensibilities. for a long time did not envision herself taking over as the managing director of  , a ceramics manufacturer founded by her mother,  , in Kuusamo, Northern Ostrobothnia, in 1974. “I was sure basically throughout my school years here that I wouldn’t be staying in Kuusamo,” she tells. “After junior high, I was an exchange student in Pennsylvania, the US. That year left me with an interest in internationalisation, and I thought an international career would be the thing for me.” But take over she did – although only after a journey that took her to study international business in Turku – which, she duly points out, was as far as she could go without leaving Finland – and international design business management in Helsinki before she found herself participating in a product development project at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. “That settled it for me,” retorts Valkama-Kettunen. “They had the same kind of startup buzz there that we do today in Finland. We were there with our fellow students, investors and business representatives, getting what could be described as a marination in positivity.” Armed with her new-found positivity and unbridled enthusiasm, she decided to return to see what was going on with Bjarmia and how it felt to be back in Kuusamo. It felt good and the preparations to pass the company on to her began roughly a year later, in 2008. “In a year I became sure that I wanted to live again in Kuusamo. I love the northern nature and feel that the quality of life is very good here,” she explains. “But five days after we signed the papers and completed the change of generation, the first American bank collapsed. I knew the crisis would also hit Finland,” she says. It was not the first major crisis to get in the way of the ceramics manufacturer, however. Kaisa Valkama-Kettunen, the CEO of Bjarmia, says the diverse and unique nature of Kuusamo is her main source of inspiration. “And it shows.” Bjarmia had outgrown its original production facility by the early 1980s and began drawing up plans for a larger facility on the same land plot to respond to growing demand particularly from corporate customers. “We sold a lot of ceramics as business gifts in the 1980s and had roughly two dozen employees at the factory,” tells Valkama-Kettunen. Her mother was responsible for production, design and sales, as well as the café built in the second floor of the facility. It was a lot to handle for one person, and a decision was made to either downsize and make the company more easily manageable or pursue growth and bring in more people. “The matter was settled by the 1990s depression. We started to scale down operations, cut products and move in a more distinct direction,” she says. The decision was momentous also in that it saw the company shift away from machine-assisted production and re-align itself as a manufacturer of unique handmade ceramics. This belief in the craft of its employees is what sets the company apart from the competition also today, believes Valkama-Kettunen. “Our products are handmade, and it’s allowed to show. We don’t use any moulds or stamps. Every single line is carved by hand, and that’s why every cup and plate is different – and that’s also the objective,” she says. Valkama-Kettunen, who is also the lead designer at Bjarmia, reveals that she draws her inspiration mainly from the rich cultural history and unique and diverse nature of Kuusamo. “Our company has a long history, but our name dates as far back as the Viking Age. We’re following in the footsteps of the Bjarmians, who were bold and open-minded craftspeople and merchants – just like we are,” she quips. “But nature is really the main source of inspiration for all our tableware and design language in general. And it shows.” Bjarmia, she adds, has always also sought to keep step with the times and ensure its products are suitable for everyday use: “Our products are more than decorative items: everything is oven, microwave oven and dishwasher-proof. They’ve also been shaped in a way that they stack neatly in the dishwasher.” Valkama-Kettunen is looking forward to finding out whether such a distinctive design language also appeals to audiences outside Finland and has initiated negotiations with potential co-operation partners in Japan and Canada. “Japan is a country that has been on our mind for a while. We gave it some thought in the 1990s, but the world was so different that we would’ve had to ship a container full of samples,” she says. That is not to suggest an expansion into a new market is entirely without its challenges today, of course. Valkama-Kettunen recently showcased her work at the  , realising that a lot of attention must be paid to localising the products and satisfying the locals’ yen for details of the design and production processes. Bjarmia has certainly demonstrated a propensity for adapting to market changes and other external forces over its 45-year history – a quality not dissimilar to the elasticity of its main raw material, clay. “Mum used to say early on that all of this started from a lump of clay,” tells Valkama-Kettunen.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-drinking-habit-that-s-fit-for-a-queen/,A drinking habit that’s fit for a queen,"If the Queen gives you a business idea, why wouldn’t you let her know by writing her a letter? Finnish company Her Majesty’s Drinking Box has the royal to thank for a lot of things. Plastic straws aren’t at the peak of their popularity. In the UK, the Queen herself has banned them from the royal estates, encouraging various British corporations to follow suit; and the government is set to ban all single-use plastics, with a similar proposal coming from the EU. Stateside, some areas are considering doing away with plastic straws and certain organisations have taken action. For  , the wake-up call was seeing a viral video of a turtle having a plastic straw pulled out of its nose. The heartbreaking footage made him think: is there really nothing we can do about this? Fortunately, Salomäki happens to be someone with a background as an inventor and connections in the packaging industry. He decided it was time for a whole new package. “The regular juice boxes with straws are quite impractical,” he says. “For example, when I go to the woods with my six-year-old son, the wind might catch the plastic wrapping of the straw, and the juice spills easily if the package is accidentally squeezed. I figured the concept should be reinvented.” Her Majesty’s Drinking Box is still waiting for a letter from the Queen. The idea came from who else but the Queen herself. If she can skip a straw, why can’t the rest of us? Salomäki’s brainchild is called Skip a Straw, which is also a registered trademark of a company called  . The package contains no loose parts, and it’s stiff enough for children to grab without creating wet spots on the car seat. Incidentally, Salomäki also happens to work in patenting. Thus, he isn’t willing to disclose other details of the design or material choices before all the red tape is 100 per cent over with. “All I can say is that the solution is compatible with current production materials and methods.” However, some lucky ones have seen and tested the product first hand. Salomäki tells that in a consumer study conducted by Her Majesty’s Drinking Box, a 3D presentation of the solution beat traditional juice packages by a clear margin. On top of this, the innovation has convinced   to fund both product development and internationalisation. According to Salomäki, there are plenty of ongoing talks with prospective clients, mainly big beverage industry players both in Finland and abroad. “Our target market: the world,” says Mika Salomäki. Her Majesty’s Drinking Box isn’t planning on manufacturing the packages in its own factory. Instead, it’s searching for licensees who’d use the solution in their own production. Salomäki strongly believes that the demand is global and urgent, not least due to changing regulation in the EU and elsewhere. “Our target market: the world,” he says and laughs. “Of course, we’ll first start from Europe, but eventually we’ll hopefully be present everywhere.” The company, founded by Salomäki and his colleague and mentored by a packaging industry professional, is far from finished with its innovation process. Despite the understandable mysteriousness around the firstcomer, the range is set to grow. “We’re talking about ecological products that could be used in cafés and burger joints, for example,” Salomäki says, but then firmly shuts his mouth about further details. However, there’s still one question that needs to be asked. Will Her Majesty ever be seen with a Skip a Straw in hand? “We did write her a letter to formally ask for permission to call our company Her Majesty’s Drinking Box. Too bad we forgot to add the return address. Maybe James Bond could lend a hand to the Queen?”   is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wiilubike-brings-a-touch-of-forest-to-biking/,Wiilubike brings a touch of forest to biking,"If it can be made out of wood, you can find it in Finland. This applies to bicycles as well and now a wooden city bike, Wiilubike, is hitting the streets. Chopping firewood is a popular summer pastime for many Finns and  is no exception. In 2014, the founder and CEO of   was splitting birch trunks at his home farm when the idea hit him. Alaruka envisioned a very different use for the high-quality birch than just firewood. “I was in primary school when I fished out an old bike from River Kokemäenjoki [in southwestern Finland] for the first time. I repaired it and sold it to a classmate,” Alaruka recalls. “I continued restoring old bikes throughout my studies and built a career in the forest industry. Then came my ‘eureka’ moment: what if I combined these two skills to make a wood-framed bicycle?” Wood Innovations Finland plants a new sapling for every tree used to make a Wiilubike. A year later, Alaruka and four of his friends set up Wood Innovations Finland to turn this idea into reality. The company’s first product, Wiilubike, was wheeled on to the market in summer 2017 targeted at design and eco-savvy city dwellers. The bike’s frame is made out of pressure-formed plywood birch, which acts as a carbon sink (stores carbon dioxide) and adds a personal touch to the bike. “Each bike is unique because the grain pattern is different in every frame,” Alaruka explains. However, bending birch to create a smooth bike frame isn’t as easy as riding a bike. It took Wood Innovations Finland two years of product development to get the bike just right. In particular, wood’s tendency to ‘live with the seasons’ and lack of necessary stiffness proved challenging to work around, but the company solved the issues by developing a proprietary structure for the frame. “We thought we’d start with an easy wood product, a bicycle,” Alaruka laughs. “We are working with an atypical material and for a single bike we have close to 200 rows of bike parts listed on a spreadsheet.” But solving challenges is part of the fun for Wood Innovations Finland. From the start, the company’s mission has been to raise awareness of the versatility and value of timber, as well as to provide an ecological solution for the serial production of bike frames. “We want to show how wood can be used for products that it traditionally hasn’t been used for. We want to improve the appreciation of wood materials,” says Alaruka. “[Wiilubike] brings the forest into the city in a more visible way as a truly practical product.” According to Ilari Alaruka, it’s good to wax a wooden bike from time to time, but otherwise it doesn’t need any special maintenance. But don’t expect to run into Wiilubikes everywhere just yet. Wood Innovations Finland has made just 50 bikes so far this year and is focusing on its home market following a new marketing partnership with Finnish furniture retailer Isku. The next step is expansion to nearby countries Sweden and Denmark and eventually to the big biking markets of Central Europe. Alaruka stresses the company isn’t in a hurry. It wants to explore the possibility of introducing new models, including a wooden e-bike, and maybe even entirely different wood products. In the end, what matters for Wood Innovations Finland is using wood to promote active lifestyles. “A bike is a universal product. Everyone has some kind of a biking memory. It would be a major achievement for us if our wooden bike could get more people excited about biking,” Alaruka concludes."

The game rendered the entire periodic table into Pokémon-style collectible characters and looked set to conquer the world. However, the company recently announced it was mothballing the game and is now looking to the horizon. As we wrote in our 2016 feature, the company’s plan was to expand its learning solutions beyond physics to possibly even include a language-based approach. “A lot of companies are fighting for getting everyone on the planet online, but what do you do with the Internet if you can’t read?” CEO    . “Creating a game that would teach all children in developing countries to read and basic English skills is a hugely intriguing idea.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/paapii-design-doesn-t-want-to-be-like-the-masses/,PaaPii Design doesn’t want to be like the masses,"When someone from Australia rings you up and tells you they want to sell your designs, you might want to consider scaling up production. PaaPii Design took note. For  , entrepreneurship was the absolute last resort. “I feel like I lack all qualities that are normally expected of those who become self-employed,” she says laughingly. “I’m not particularly outgoing, I’m not great at speaking in public, and I’m not very brave at all.” However, she’s the founder and owner of  , a Finnish company that designs and manufactures fabrics, clothes and other lifestyle products and ships them to resellers and customers around the globe. That has meant a lot of practice for Isokangas. PaaPii Design has resellers in about 30 countries. “Initially, I wasn’t very eager to jump at opportunities to gain attention or introduce the brand to people,” she admits. “Hence, it has been a learning curve to start saying yes when all I’ve wanted to do is say no.” The story of PaaPii Design started out modestly, too. As Isokangas was on maternity leave, she noticed her previous profession, ceramist, was a little too messy to be practised in the house. She decided to switch to sewing and ended up getting so excited about it that she started to share her hobby on a blog. “I didn’t tell anyone about it in the beginning, and I had no intention of it ever becoming a job,” she recalls. Half by accident, she took an evening course in entrepreneurship, yet she still had no premonition of PaaPii Design’s existence. However, as the sales through her blog started growing, she realised she had to either get serious or quit altogether. In 2011, the never-an-entrepreneur became a business owner. Isokangas’ brother helped set up an online store and, at first, the founder and her mother-in-law made all PaaPii Design products on their own. At that point, the company focused on soft toys and furnishing textiles. Soon, a wholesale firm from Australia got in touch, saying they were interested in selling PaaPii Design Down Under. In 2013, Anniina Isokangas received a 300-metre roll of the first industrially manufactured PaaPii Design fabric. At the time, she was confident she could never sell it all – but was wrong. “On our website, it wasn’t evident that the company is run by just one or two people,” she says. “Of course, I had to tell them no, but it was a wake-up call that made me think this could be more than a mere hobby.” More than seven-and-a-half years after its founding, PaaPii Design has resellers in about 30 countries, and the product range has grown to include things like clothing, DIY sewing sets and gifts. The main focus is on fabrics that are mostly sold in small, specialised stores around the world. The products are manufactured in PaaPii Design’s own factory in Kokkola, Finland, and the GOTS and Oeko-Tex-certified organic cotton fabrics are created and printed in Lithuania and Poland. Isokangas deems it of utmost importance that ethical and environmental aspects are taken into account as well as possible. “PaaPii Design walks its own path without being dependent on trends or seasonal fashion,” she explains. “We like to do things our way, and I hope that it’s a fun and original style that our customers recognise, too. My aim is to create a lifestyle and design brand beyond textile, without being categorised too strictly.” Internationalisation has taken place mainly with the help of small partners. Isokangas has been contacted by large chains, but forming partnerships with them not something she sees as a priority, especially when production should be significantly scaled up to meet their demand. “We want to cherish our image as a brand that isn’t the cheapest but can really offer value.” In speaking about future plans, Isokangas doesn’t sound like someone who fears challenges. What happened to the fearfulness? “I wouldn’t go back to working for someone else for the world,” she says. “It’s great to be able to do exactly what you want to do, and as we’ve grown I’ve been able to find others who are interested in and good at the tasks I’m not too keen on.” PaaPii Design employs about a dozen people in Finland to produce its renowned designs."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/helsinki-wildfoods-has-a-taste-for-the-wilderness/,Helsinki Wildfoods has a taste for the wilderness,"Even the most mundane of weeds can be used for delicious and healthy treats – and Helsinki Wildfoods wants the whole world to jump on the bandwagon. There is no such thing as free lunch, but there are various ways to get pretty darn close. However, a lot of us might have never thought about them. “There’s so much free superfood everywhere, and people just don’t know it,” says  , co-founder of  . “So many plants are generally just considered weed, when in reality they make for tasty spices, sauces and all sorts of food.” Even in and around central Helsinki, there are spots where any passer-by can pick up nettles, goutweed, dandelions, yarrow or angelica leaves, all of which can be turned into foods and beverages without any special equipment or skills. Initially, Helsinki Wildfoods wanted to introduce tourists to the wild food sheds in the green Finnish capital, but then it turned out that locals weren’t aware of the tasty opportunities around them either. Fancy a taste of the wild? Helsinki Wildfoods blends together urban and natural flavours. Now, the company’s foraging walks and workshops are aimed at absolutely everyone with an interest in the environment, food and sustainable lifestyle. “Eating wild food from nearby nature is as eco-friendly as it gets, because it’s got no carbon footprint whatsoever,” Toivanen explains. “And it’s really tasty, too!” The story of Helsinki Wildfoods in its current form actually started from taste. Toivanen and  , another co-founder, had started giving foraging tours in Helsinki and its neighbouring Espoo, and   happened to take part in one. At the end of each tour, homemade nettle pesto was served. Hannus insisted it was so delicious it should be sold in supermarkets. Shortly after, a large Finnish retail chain agreed. Long story short: with Hannus as its CEO, Helsinki Wildfoods offers a range of products known as Just Add. The company has created different mixes of wild plants that can be used in everyday cooking simply by adding water, oil, crème fraiche or whatever is necessary for the flavour in question, referring to the product range as “the Finnish herb revolution”. As sustainability is one of the main driving forces behind the company, Just Add products with their lengthy shelf life are precisely in line with its philosophy. “We all hate mouldy pesto leftovers in the fridge,” Toivanen notes. “With Just Add, you really can make only as much as you need at once, which reduces food waste without compromising on taste.” Sustainability drives Helsinki Wildfoods. Helsinki Wildfoods organises a few dozen courses in and near Helsinki every season. As the northern climate doesn’t really support all-year green-picking, the treats being available in supermarkets is a good complement to the company’s offering. On top of serving Finns and tourists locally in Finland, Just Add products are available in   in Sweden and other retailers in Germany, Denmark, Italy and Norway, and all over Europe through Helsinki Wildfoods’ online store. Further internationalisation is on the way, but some obstacles are yet to be overcome: For example, selling food by mail has proven more than slightly tricky. “The legislation varies hugely between countries, and even in Finland and Sweden the law doesn’t treat wild herbs in the same way,” Toivanen says. “As we’re learning ways to take our products to new markets, we’re becoming leading experts in foreign food safety regulations as well!” The letter of the law might be a hindrance, but it by no means is putting the entrepreneurs off. There are plans to localise the website for different markets and test the waters in the lucrative Asian market in co-operation with other Finnish natural food brands. Be it home or abroad, Helsinki Wildfoods’ core ideology lies in looking after the urban wilderness and the environment in general. Toivanen hopes to see more and more people open their eyes to the free gardens around them. “Foraging is a great hobby, too, offering exercise, relaxation and stress reduction, all at once.” In addition to offering taste, price and physical and mental health benefits, Helsinki Wildfoods wants to serve as a reminder to other firms, particularly large corporations. “If we can do it sustainably, big ones can do the same. We want to promote value-based entrepreneurship and transparency by setting a good example.”"

This week, we take a look at a handful of companies which emerged after their founders left the telecom giant. At its peak, Nokia was the epitome of Finland’s economic success and innovative spirit. After a well-documented decline resulted in considerable downsizing of staff earlier this century, the culture that had fostered groundbreaking technologies began to spawn numerous very promising startups. Check out these five firms founded by ex-Nokians. This company aims to brighten up the future with lights that can be adjusted to increase alertness and wellbeing. The solution offers users the possibility to adjust illumination according to their individual preferences and requirements. “Lighting has traditionally been kind of accidental,” CEO    . “It is always a bit too bright or dark with limited controls. But today, tuneable lighting makes it possible to mimic natural light and even change colour temperature based on the weather outside or what someone is doing. We call it lighting that fits the purpose.” The technology relies on Bluetooth and a wireless mesh network that together with an easy-to-use app and an intuitive interface make for a user-friendly solution. In any relationship, communication is key. Yet, whilst we may call dogs “man’s best friend”, it’s difficult to say exactly how they are feeling. The people at Anaxeos thus have created a smart vest for four-legged furballs that pairs with an application to help us to keep track of our companions’ health and wellness. “Anaxeos doesn’t make pie charts and histograms,” founder   a year ago. “Instead, it makes sense of the numbers and gives alerts and suggestions regarding things like what to do if your dog’s temperature is too high.” It is not a well-kept secret that our morning readiness depends heavily on how well we slept the night before. The founders of Quiteon have come to the rescue for light sleepers – now it’s time to get some undisturbed shut-eye with noise cancelling earbuds! The earbuds effectively block out all noise but have been engineered to especially shut out low frequencies, such as snoring. So far, the technology has been received with well-rested, open arms. “Our feedback has been magical,” COB    . “The product has the potential to change people’s lives. Its ability to minimise the irritation caused by snoring has already saved some marriages.” As its name suggests, this company has set out to boost teamwork with the help of technology. With the ActionTrack solution, users can design, create and gamify indoor and outdoor experiences anywhere. At its core, Team Action Zone is about boosting synergy between employees and getting people moving. “We want to offer something that can increase the sense of community and help people exercise,” CEO   . “This is our contribution to better health, fun learning and encouraging creativity.” The good people at Disior want to give bone fractures a taste of their own medicine by supporting the decision-making of doctors with the help of numerical data. The software turns medical images into figures and statistics that aid the diagnosis and treatment planning of bone fractures and soft-tissue damage. “Currently this type of analysis is largely manual, which means that decisions about treatment can be highly subjective,”   Disior CEO . “Our software provides data that is accurate, objective and comparable.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/unikie-is-driving-the-future-of-software-development/,Unikie drives the future of software development,"Taking Finnish engineering expertise overseas has always been a core element of the internationalisation strategy of Unikie, a software developer headquartered in Tampere. , a software developer headquartered in Tampere, Finland, has succeeded in what most startup entrepreneurs dream of while racing from one technology event to another: signing collaboration agreements with several leading technology providers such as  ,   and  . , the chief executive of the four-year-old startup, uses an ice hockey analogy – a relatively common trait in that part of the country – to explain the success. Founded in 2015, Unikie has swiftly grown into a major software development company. “Get the puck to the net and good things will happen,” he remarks self-deprecatingly. “We’ve put in a lot of work,” he adds to expand on the analogy. “But maybe the logos of big international clients [in our references] have been a bit easier to come by than we dared to expect initially. I suppose we’ve just been doing the right things successfully.” Unikie, he tells, was initially prepared to spend the first five years building a platform that enables it to run a profitable business domestically and pursue its internationalisation goals. The startup is seemingly ahead of schedule. It   recently it has signed agreements with a handful of major, but unnamed, automotive manufacturers in Central Europe. A growing number of its staff are consequently working on developing machine vision and pattern recognition solutions to enable cars and other machines to recognise and evade people and obstacles. Its other main markets are telecommunications, smart industrial machines, and traditional internet and information technology. “The solutions we’re increasingly providing for autonomous driving and smart industries, they require all of these four areas. It’s a smart strategy for allocating our competences. The cars are not driving themselves with all of the necessary stuff under the hood,” reminds Mertsalmi. Unikie has recorded a profit in each of its 48 months in operation and added to its headcount at an impressive pace. The company wrapped up last year with a staff of 250 spread across its subcontractor network and a turnover of 16 million euros, 80 per cent of which was derived from Finland. “We’ve been growing on a cash flow-basis,” Mertsalmi tells. The company was ranked one of Finland’s most promising startups earlier this year by Finnish financial publication Talouselämä. “There haven’t been any big growth spurts. Four years, 250 people – that’s a pace of about 50 a year. The turnover target for this year is 30 million euros, but whether we’ll meet it still depends on a lot of things. We’ll break the 25 million-euro mark for sure, though.” The startup, he views, has managed to carve out a share of the highly competitive market by taking advantage of the megatrend of digitalisation, aggressively pursuing international growth and – simply – offering unrivalled quality, regardless of cost. “We aren’t competing with low prices; sometimes we’re more expensive than local alternatives. But we’re expensive because skilled labour costs money. We’re genuinely trying to identify the competences and find the best workers. And that’s a lot easier to justify when your prices are transparent,” he explains. Although Unikie is involved in developing software for the machines and vehicles of tomorrow, it has one finger firmly on the pulse of the needs of existing technologies. “We’re not only focusing on what’s coming 10 years from now, but we’re also developing solutions for today’s systems. I’m talking about things like how to update software remotely, how to enable motorists to add new features to their vehicles and how to connect phones to vehicles,” lists Mertsalmi. Unikie’s belief in Finnish engineering expertise has proven another key differentiator, according to him. “Internationalisation, for us at least, has always been about exporting Finnish engineering expertise. The prevalent thinking in the industry is that you should create a product and hope that it sells. But that’s a difficult way to generate traction for exports,” he says. Mertsalmi points out that the digital transformation, which has been forced abruptly upon companies regardless of their industry, can be particularly challenging for well-established companies. “The change needed to evolve into a technology firm in an agile fashion is massive for companies like automotive makers, which have grown into dominant brands on the strengths of their logistics systems,” he says. Large corporations, he adds, may struggle to make the digital leap also due to the burden of their legacy solutions. “Things don’t get simpler but more complicated, because many have a 20-year legacy of information technology solutions. You can’t just toss out the legacy, but it has to be taken into account in further development. That’s why the solution has to be more complicated,” explains Mertsalmi. “Luckily Finland has plenty of capable people to solve these problems,” he adds."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/garmendo-gets-sweaty-without-sweatshops/,Garmendo gets sweaty without sweatshops,"Finland’s Garmendo knows what’s expected of a great piece of sportswear and what’s expected of the makers of them, as well. Stretch! Jump! Lift! Hit! Squat and up again, and then back down! Despite the flawless images in sportswear catalogues, it’s not easy to look photogenic whilst doing sports. We sweat, turn red, can’t quite reach our toes – and our clothes need to be able to bear with us, whatever the position. Minna and Milja Eerikäinen have a long history in all kinds of sports.  and   are well familiar with the challenges textiles face whilst being worn in action. The two sisters have a combined history in athletics, running, horse riding, dancing, gymnastics and yoga, many of which are still part of their everyday life. On top of this, they both have worked in the sports industry, and Minna Eerikäinen with textiles, too. A couple of years ago, the duo started to think about the issues of the fashion industry, such as bad quality of clothing, lack of recycling and labour rights. “We decided that we want to do something else,” Minna Eerikäinen says. “There are so many incredible and innovative technologies, companies and products that have appeared in recent years that we wanted to give them a go.” In 2017, the sisters started to test the market with  , an online marketplace for sustainable, conscious and good-looking activewear. As the sisters had taken note of the bad quality and dodgy manufacturing processes of many brands, Garmendo focuses on working exclusively with companies that are certifiably ethical and sustainable. It’s not just about production or materials; Minna Eerikäinen says that Garmendo’s approach is holistic and applies to the entire supply chain. “Our business model is to sell ecological and ethical products, and this includes the treatment of workers at factories as well as packaging and shipping,” she explains. “That way, our values are present all the way from choosing materials to manufacturing and the customer’s door.” Going online was a natural choice to Garmendo, as the goal was to go international from the start. Initially the target markets were the UK and Germany, and Finland is slowly following suit, as is the rest of Europe. In addition to personal experience in sports, Minna Eerikäinen has a diverse background in international business: she has worked in Germany, the UK, Estonia and Spain, mainly with clients from Germany, the Nordics and the US. “Australia and North America have a huge demand for ethical sportswear as well, so eventually we’ll head there are well,” she tells. Although there are plans to set up a storage somewhere in Europe at some stage, currently all parcels are packed and shipped from Garmendo’s headquarters in Jätkäsaari, Helsinki, by the Eerikäinens. The show is run by the sisters, while subcontractors and other collaborators are of immense help. “With our great partners, it’s easy to establish Garmendo in new markets,” Minna Eerikäinen notes. However big the company grows, its vision won’t change: Garmendo doesn’t want people to be disappointed when they receive their parcels. She remembers all too well how it felt to get her hands on an order and notice it was nothing like what was pictured on whatever website she got it from. “There’s so much low-quality stuff pumped into the market, so what you get might be very different from what you thought you would.” Thus, Garmendo is picky when it comes to the brands it chooses to sell. Eerikäinen notes that although now some of the brands are relatively small, big ones are also welcomed – as long as they act ethically. She knows from her experience in the industry that large ships turn slower than small boats. But the tide is changing for sure. “The textile industry is one of the most polluting ones in the world,” Eerikäinen says. “We want to give people the best alternatives we can to help change that.” Garmendo is not only focusing on small brands; if the big ones go conscious, they’re welcome to join the selection."

Say hi to five ways local entrepreneurs are helping parents raise their offspring. From digital tools for learning and saving memories to analogue board games, kids’ design and keeping the small bundles of love safe, this   of child-friendly innovations will give parents a breather. Baby diaries are still ink and paper for most parents, although the majority of photos, videos and even conversations are digital. What if there was a dedicated digital platform where all baby business could be documented and where relatives could leave comments? Well, toddle no further since Kidday co-founders  and  may have the answer. “Our slogan is that every moment with your child is priceless,” Nieminen   in 2018. “That’s why Kidday’s aim is to enable families to store and share those moments with others, and eventually with the children themselves.” Kidday offers families the best of both worlds – the convenience of digital and the touchy-feeliness of analogue – since the users can print the journal for physical safe-keeping. Kids on their tablets and phones may seem like a troubling sign of  to older generations. However, there could be some intensive science-based learning going on. Meet Playvation, the company behind the Moomin Language School, a Moomin-powered digital language learning tool for children aged three to seven. “You learn the language just as you did your mother tongue: through play,”    , the CEO of Playvation. “We have weekly themes that align with the development goals of the Finnish early childhood education curriculum. We deal with emotions, develop social skills and foster creativity.” The Moomins support not just the fun part of learning, but they also mirror values such as courageousness, equality and appreciation of nature – values that, according to Guttorm, are universal in today’s world. Founded in 1959 to produce seat belts and moving into the child seat market in 1967, Klippan is a traditional company with a well-established clientele abroad. The Finnish company exports 80 per cent of its products to foreign countries. “We are a very small company and there are plenty of other players in the market that are much bigger than us,”   sales, purchases and logistics manager   “However, our small size is also a strength, as we can be agile and move forward with our product development without unnecessary delays.” One of competitive edges of Klippan is the rear-facing child seat, which, although already common in the Nordics, is generating considerable interest elsewhere due to its enhanced safety. What started as a sewing hobby and blog has become a company that ships to over 30 countries. Mostly sold in specialised shops, PaaPii’s products take ethical and environmental aspects into account as much as possible. “PaaPii Design walks its own path without being dependent on trends or seasonal fashion,”   founder and owner  . “We like to do things our way, and I hope that it’s a fun and original style that our customers recognise, too. My aim is to create a lifestyle and design brand beyond textile, without being categorised too strictly.” A self-proclaimed unlikely entrepreneur, Isokangas has had to learn a lot during her eight-year stint running the company, but she seems as confident as ever. “It’s great to be able to do exactly what you want to do, and as we’ve grown I’ve been able to find others who are interested in and good at the tasks I’m not too keen on.” Storyteller, artist, entrepreneur and mother of six  was worried about the lack of play and imagination with kids today. She decided to use her talents to bring about a world of fairytales, magic and imagination in the form of Pomenia, which today is a board game, a book and a mobile app. “My aim was to create a game that’s not so much about teaching cognitive skills as it is about encouraging kids to explore the world of fairytales, adventures and imagination,”   Grahn. Grahn believes her stories can offer people of any age the time and space to escape themselves and step into a world of imagination. “The best thing about imagination is that it makes you forget who and how old you are and what your role in this world is,” said Grahn. “A good fairytale not only teaches kids to read and write, but it also takes them on an adventure that gives a lesson about empathy and ethics. I can’t imagine what could be more important than that.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/do-i-know-you-joel-willans/,Do I Know You?,"Originally from the UK, Joel Willans is the creator of social media sensation Very Finnish Problems and author of 101 Very Finnish Problems and More Very Finnish Problems. Love, work and study. These are the three most popular reasons that foreigners move to Finland. For Joel Willans, surprisingly, the weather also played a significant role in him staying here. Having arrived in his girlfriend’s homeland during what was one of the warmest summers on record, he decided he wouldn’t return to his native London and instead set himself up in Finland’s capital. Over 15 years later, Willans is the co-founder of a very successful digital marketing agency, Ink Tank Media, an award-winning author and copywriter. Perhaps his greatest success has come with  , an often-hilarious collection of memes that gently pokes fun at Finnish culture (whilst simultaneously embracing it) that first appeared on Facebook and has since inspired two books. Read on to discover what makes Finns laugh, what to do in a sauna and the biggest differences that exist between Brits and Finns. I never really had a dream profession as such. However, I’ve always loved books and history and ideally wanted to do something that involved them both. This meant that at various times, I considered being a librarian, a bookshop owner, a historian, a museum curator, a foreign correspondent and an author. So, sometimes dreams do come true.  started as a bet with a friend who worked in marketing. I wanted to prove I could create a Facebook page with 10 000 followers in a month without spending any money. It hit 15K within three weeks. Now it has nearly 500 000 fans – on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram – and reaches an average of 10 million people a month, making it Finland’s most popular viral brand. It’s also a pair of best-selling books. As for ideas, I get them simply living life here on top of the world. I’ve always had a soft spot for  . I know it’s two words, but I’m a sucker for a good rhyme and a warm day is always welcome. If I had to generalise, I’d say Brits speak a lot more, but their words have less value. People often comment on the lack of Finnish small talk, but I think it has more to do with honesty. Brits are less likely to tell you how they really feel and instead share fluffy pleasantries. Finns, on the other hand, simply don’t see the point of that. They’re comfortable with silence and, if things are crap, they’ll tell you. Brits are also far more patronising to foreigners. Thanks to history and language, many have this innate sense of superiority, despite the fact that the UK is no longer an imperial behemoth, but rather just a small island off the coast of Europe. Then you have their still very present obsession with class. Brits instinctively “doff their caps” to anyone they believe to be of a higher social status. They’re also more into individualism, uber capitalism and money and less into helping each other and collectivism. On the plus side, Brits to do have a marvellous sense of humour and are very quick to smile. I’d also argue, that as a rule, they’re more worldly in outlook and less prone to melancholy, despite the regular rain. Good question. Based upon  , I’d say, Finns appear to enjoy observational comedy, especially when it deals with the weather and Finnish stereotypes. They also, of course, love a good laugh at Sweden’s expense and memes which showcase the joys of summer cottage and winter life. You can also guarantee a giggle when you showcase the wonderful weirdness of many aspects of Finnish life that seem normal to Finns themselves. Take a bow, ice swimming and  . Well, resurrecting the dead is a lot more magical and I still love learning about the past, so I’d go for three historical Finnish icons. Firstly,   just because he looms so large over modern Finnish history and it would be great to separate the man from the myth. The same goes for my second guest,  . He seems like a fascinating character and I’d be interested to see what it was about him that enabled him to rule Finland for so long. Finally, I’d invite  . While I’m not an obsessive Moomin fan (sacrilege, I know), I’d love to learn about her life and her inspiration for creating something so utterly bizarre. That said, I imagine a dinner where I hosted these luminaries would involve me chattering in nervous excitement while they all sat around the table in bored, stony silence. I’m in the enviable position of doing what I love. I’ve worked in the advertising business in one form or another for nearly 20 years. For the last eight or so, that has been as a co-founder of Ink Tank Media. In this time, I’ve been very lucky to have worked with iconic Finnish companies such as Nokia, all things Moomin, Fiskars, Rovio, Iittala, F-Secure, Stora Enso and Supercell. One thing they’ve all had in common is that I’ve had the chance to get creative either working on content strategies or content creation itself. Each one of these areas rocks my boat, because I love the idea of creating something which is potentially enjoyed by millions of people. The downside of this passion is that the only way I can really relax is when I turn off the internet and go travelling. Thankfully, that’s quite frequently. It has taught me many things for which I’m thankful. Finland and Finns have taught me to be comfortable with silence, which I find a really useful life skill. I’m also a lot more appreciative of living a healthy work-life balance. The Finnish way of disappearing to the forest for the whole of July is a thing of wonder. On a more practical level, I feel far better equipped to deal with rubbish weather and have an even greater appreciation of sunshine. Finally, and perhaps most wondrously, considering how terrible I’ve been at winter sports for practically my entire adult life, living in Finland has taught me to ski. Always sit on the lowest bench. Wow! That’s a tough one. Well, if I’m still going strong, I’d love to have a novel published. I’ve published a short story collection and I’ve written two non-fiction books. It would be marvellous to add a novel to the list. I’d also love to see   on the big or small screen. I’ve had conversations and interest from both film-makers and production companies, so it would be ace to think a TV series, film or documentary would have happened by then. I have no doubt it would do really well, here and internationally. As for where I’ll be geographically, I imagine Helsinki, (but wintering for longer and longer in the Mediterranean sunshine). Hopefully by then I’ll also have finally mastered Finnish and maybe even ice skating. One can always dream."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/clam-man-exposing-fishy-business-in-snacky-bay/,Clam Man: exposing fishy business in Snacky Bay,"This point-and-click adventure game by a small Finnish indie developer is a witty and easy-going tribute to the classics of the genre. The game doesn’t take itself too seriously but is steeped in absurd comedy. When it comes to the video game industry in Finland, major game studios such as  ,   and   stand out from the field. But as the industry matures, also the indie game development scene is producing more and more interesting games. A recent example of this is   a quirky adventure game released in May this year. The game was created by a three-person team – Team Clam – who started developing the game as a hobby and turned to crowdfunding to finalise the project. The game tells the story of – yes – Clam Man: a half-clam, half-human character, who in the beginning of the game gets fired from a comfortable office job at a mayonnaise manufacturer. This starts Clam Man’s adventure, during which he meets various colourful personalities, discovers an evil conspiracy, and confronts the dark underbelly of Snacky Bay, the town where he lives. As the brief description perhaps suggests, the game doesn’t take itself too seriously but is steeped in absurd comedy. Indeed,   is a laid-back experience that focuses on story and humour, and mostly shuns head-scratching puzzles that some gamers might expect from the point-and-click genre. Team Clam started developing the game as a hobby and turned to crowdfunding to finalise the project. , the writer and designer of  , says that he and his brother (who worked as a programmer on the game) grew up playing a lot of point-and-click adventure games. Particularly LucasArts’s games such as   and   were an inspiration to the team when it came to making their own game. Although puzzles were a staple of these games, “they never were what we remembered or liked about those games – it was always about the comedy and the characters,” Martin says. So, when   started to take shape, “we decided to play to our strengths, which in this case was a particular style of humour and comedy, and then build the game around it.” All in all, the game took about a-year-and-a-half to create, including the crowdfunding campaign. “We didn’t expect much from the campaign, but we were lucky to have so many wonderful people donate and help us out,” Martin says. He adds that the success of the crowdfunding effort improved the final version of  , particularly as it allowed the team to hire a composer to score the game. Altogether, the game took about a-year-and-a-half to create. While major game studios can invest greatly in marketing, smaller developers have to find more economical ways of getting the word out. A crucial part of this is an active promotion on social media, and engagement with the audience by posting regular updates and participating in discussions. Martin says that for a small game developer, this part of the business can be overwhelming: “We wanted to make a game, not get six months of marketing experience!” “But when you’re an indie dev, it’s mandatory and unavoidable, and if you’re a small-time indie, like us, then doubly so!” he says. “On the plus side, we did get to meet a lot of wonderful people who have helped us on the way, so in the end it is really all worth it.” Although the Finnish gaming industry is mainly based in Helsinki, Martin says that smaller teams of game developers exist all over the country. (Team Clam was based in Vaasa during the development of the game.) But as creating connections is a key aspect of the business, traveling to face-to-face events such as trade shows and workshops may be needed. “That said, it’s important to remember that today, the gaming industry and market are global, digital, and open to pretty much anyone. So technically, you can make an amazing game and make money off it, no matter where you are,” he says. “You just need a computer. And your game needs to be really good too. That’s kind of important.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-breathe-easy-with-these-innovations/,Five for Friday: Breathe easy with these innovations,"Finland has some of the best air quality in the world but also some of the most state-of-the-art technologies to tackle impurities. These Finnish innovators will take your breath away with their life-changing solutions! Clean air and healthy indoor air quality are becoming more of a luxury than a guarantee in places around the world. The global air purification market hovers around 29 billion dollars and has no intention of decreasing anytime soon, quite the contrary. Meanwhile, technology is catching up with the challenges and the future of chronic respiratory diseases may look brighter than you thought with these air purification solutions. Air0 is the brainchild of co-founder and CTO  , an inventor with over 500 patents under his belt. The inspiration came on a visit to China in 2013, following a realisation of the scale of the air purification challenge in the country. Rajala developed an air purification technology that uses looser fibres compared to traditional methods, which are powered with an electric booster. The result was a machine with an extraordinary cleaning efficiency and air flow rate, which nowadays is one of the company’s competitive edges. “We knew we had a great technology, but since our competitors in China are big companies like Haier and Samsung we had to pick our target group very carefully,”   co-founder and CEO  . “There is less competition in the business market, and our products stand out even better there because of the amount of air they can clean.” The Espoo-based company is heading for full automation and is currently rolling out its cloud-based solution, capable of constant and automatic monitoring and adjustment of the purifiers according to air quality. “Our long-term goal is to be the globally leading air quality company. Not necessarily in terms of turnover, but we want to be the innovator and trendsetter in the industry,” said Kulmala. The Helsinki-based healthtech company Naava provides smart and green active walls that not only look good, but also purify indoor air and optimise humidity, resulting in a healthier working environment and more active employees. “The idea of the active plant wall – Fresh Wall – developed by us is to circulate indoor air through the root zone in the plant wall. At the same time, the fans located in the top part of the wall blow clean air back into the room. The Fresh Wall can also be used to optimise indoor air humidity by controlling water evaporation, for example,” co-founder     to us back in 2014, when the startup was only taking its first steps under the name Naturvention. Hard work has paid off and Naava has recently closed distribution deals in South Korea, the UK and North America. Naava has also begun a crowdfunding round and stated plans for an IPO in 2020-2021. Naava’s intention is to revolutionise not one, but three global markets: the nine billion-dollar interior landscaping market, the 29 billion-dollar air purification market and the 50 billion-dollar office furniture market. “As urbanisation picks up speed, we want to offer people living in the world’s metropolises the chance to breathe clean natural air with the help of Naava’s technology,”   co-founder and CEO  . “Poor indoor air has severe harmful effects on the health of millions of people every day. Naava believes that healthy air should be a human right. The air we breathe will be the next global health trend, right after food and water.” Air purifier company Lifa Air was founded in 1988 by brothers   and  . The company has since expanded to some 1 000 employees and currently provides its air purification devices to both professional and consumer markets internationally. A few years ago, the company took up a joint venture with the Chinese audio system manufacturer Edifier to provide air purifiers to the growing customer base in big Chinese cities. “You can really feel the smog in your lungs,”    , the CEO of Lifa Air. “The problem is serious and people talk about it daily.” The company targets middle- and upper-class Chinese consumers, who can afford the minimalistic, thousand-euro device. The joint project was a win-win deal for both companies: Lifa Air had the knowhow and Edifier was looking for a new product segment with the proper manufacturing capacity. Lifa Air still manufactures the professional air purifiers itself, but, given the added volume of consumer products, Edifier is well suited to match the growing demand in China. Lifa Air has had business in over 50 countries and is looking towards Europe and the Middle East for its future moves due to the areas’ suitable legislative and infrastructural conditions. “For example, in Dubai the conditions are challenging with plenty of skyscrapers and sand flying around. The air simply has to be cleaned.” Researchers at the University of Oulu in Northern Finland came up with a solution to bypass traditional time-consuming methods of respiratory measurements. The invention goes by the name of respiratory effort test and is currently in clinical trials. “We wanted to create a quick, easy and affordable way to measure the ease or difficulty of breathing,”    , professor of biomedical technology and head of the physiological signal analysis group at the University of Oulu. “We explored the possibilities of using a mobile phone to measure respiration. Today’s mobile phones contain many sensors and advanced measurement technology, making them a versatile measuring tool.” Using the existing sensors of a device that pretty much everyone has and carries around also provides the easy chance to measure one’s breathing in different places. The effort test hence provides more data regarding the air quality in one’s workplace and home. The data is analysed by the solution’s AI-powered analysis software. Finnish startup Hapella’s device WellO2 lets you train your respiratory muscles whether you’re a person with chronic breathing difficulties or an athlete. WellO2’s test results show that a 30 per cent increase in exhaling and inhaling strength could be achieved in just a few weeks of respiratory training. “When you blow into the device, the resistance created opens up your airways so when you inhale the warm vapour it gets deeper into your airways,”    , CEO of Hapella. “This combination opens up your airways and clears mucus, while breathing against resistance trains the respiratory muscles.” The creator of the device,   himself an asthmatic person, came up with the idea through his positive experiences in sauna and with resistive breathing. The combination of both elements eventually led to the invention securing 1.5 million euros in funding in just a few months. Now the company is planning to build WellO2 into an internationally recognised brand."

While various self-service checkout systems already aim to tackle this problem, Heiman notes that they can be slow for consumers to use. What Smartcart is working on instead is using its tablet as a barcode scanner. A consumer can scan products as they are picked and pay at the end through the same tablet. The company seeks to transform its tablets into self-service checkouts. The Smartcart scanner remains in testing, but it has already raised investors’ interest. Recently, the company announced a   – including R&D funding from   –  aimed at international expansion and transforming its tablets into self-service checkouts. Heiman started to work on his digital shopping trolley idea four years ago. After sounding out the concept with a friend, professor of marketing  , Heiman found partners in   and   and founded Smartcart in spring 2014. The company had its first proof-of-concept projects up and running within a few months, but it took several years of product development to get Smartcart to where it is now. A critical issue for the company was making the system as frictionless for retailers as possible. “For most store managers, their core business is purchasing and selling products, and that is what they want to focus on,” Heiman explains. “We have created a system we can now deliver as a ready package. It covers everything: installation, automatic charging, maintenance. The store staff don’t have to do anything.” Smartcart, which employs 20 people, is currently used by over 90 stores in Finland and has struck a partnership with the Superseis grocery store chain in Paraguay. Superseis is where the company is testing its self-service checkout system, and it also marks the first step in its internationalisation plans. “We are talking about taking this [partnership] to the next stage,” says Heiman. “We also have several discussions ongoing in Europe and the Middle East, and we are identifying other suitable retail chains.” Heiman believes the key challenge retailers face today is how to combine the best of two worlds, online and brick-and-mortar shopping. Digital has made customers demand fewer queues and more personalisation, and this is why Smartcart has the potential to thrive. “In a few years’ time, the shopping trolley won’t be just a steel frame and wheels; it will integrate the checkout, bonus points, information services and advertising,” Heiman predicts. “We want to be the company that transforms this market.” “As online shopping grows, brick and mortar stores have to change and become more efficient. Personalisation is one of the big trends [we can deliver],” says Petteri Heiman, Smartcart CEO.   is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/timma-finds-just-the-right-time-for-pampering/,Timma finds just the right time for pampering,"When a hairdresser and a potential client happen to have the same two-hour slot vacant in their calendars, Finnish company Timma brings them together – saving time and money and boosting business. Timma is applying a logic familiar from horeca to the service industry by offering a software and a marketplace in one package. Hotels and restaurants have had them for what feels like forever: marketplaces where people can browse and make their choice based on pricing, location and customer reviews. Although the platforms take their slice of the money, it tends to be a win-win situation, as it helps service providers gain visibility without too much marketing and keep an eye on the competition. Customers, for their part, can easily compare different options and avoid unpleasant experiences by reading about those of others. That’s not the case with hairdressers, cosmetologists and massage therapists. More often than not, people have to do extensive Google searches to find someone near them, keep their fingers crossed for transparent pricing and expected quality, and consider themselves lucky if they stumble across a suitable last-minute time slot. Sounds cumbersome, not far from the phone-book yellow pages; but it doesn’t have to be that way. Finnish company Timma is set to digitalise the way we search and book our pampering, be it next door to our homes or away on holiday. “The market is huge,” says co-founder and chief strategy officer  . “So many entrepreneurs in these industries are just using pens, papers and phones. Timma can make it all a lot easier for everyone.” Simply put, Timma enables consumers to search for a new hairdo, relief for their sore muscles or a facial on the map. The prices are easy to spot, and users can leave reviews and share their experiences, helping spread the word about the best in-town services. The map view also helps travellers find trusted services near them wherever they are: for example, in case a Helsinkian happens to have free time after a business meeting in Oslo. For entrepreneurs, Timma offers a great way to ensure there are as few empty slots in the calendar as possible, maximising revenue and efficiency. On the platform, businesses can offer last-minute bookings at a discount and invoice the customer directly through Timma, without risking losing the money in case of no-show. Miikka Kujala is one of the six founders, who have grown Timma to a nearly 20-strong international company. However, the digital calendar isn’t the only thing Timma can help entrepreneurs with. Kujala emphasises that pretty much everything but bookkeeping can be organised through Timma, all the way from a cash register and a booking system to a GDRP-compliant client listing. “For instance, a hairdresser can record a customer’s hair dye code on the system to see it automatically as they book an appointment,” Kujala explains. The platform has been developed in close collaboration with entrepreneurs, with some piloting it in everyday use before it became commercially available. That’s why Kujala is confident in saying their solution is the best on the market. Timma was founded by Kujala and five of his friends, all students at Aalto University. Some of them were studying business, some industrial management, and the rest were into computer science – the perfect combination for Timma. The first version of Timma as software-as-a-service was launched in 2015. Since then, it has become wildly popular in  , with over 2 500 businesses using it. Timma charges a monthly fee and, when clients book through the service, a commission. “Currently we’ve got neither time nor need to do any marketing, as there are so many people contacting us directly,” Kujala explains. A year-and-a-half ago, Timma travelled to  . Taking over the market in the western neighbour was a little trickier than back at home, as two conventional players already shared the majority of the market. Slowly but surely, Timma started to gain traction. In May, Timma acquired a   competitor. This way, Timma got an experienced sales team with extensive market knowledge, and the sales team got a better product than what they originally had. Further expansions are being planned, with the team mapping market maturity and competition across Europe. Kujala believes that the need for a service like Timma is only set to grow, as entrepreneurs realise how much time and effort digitalisation can save them by freeing them from answering calls and hand-writing in notebooks. “Customers are increasingly seeking for flexibility and wanting to be able to book their appointments whenever they feel like it,” he notes. “That’s the direction we’re headed in, and businesses will have to follow suit.” In 2016, Timma got a seed funding boost of 350 000 euros from Reaktor Ventures to boost its internationalisation efforts."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-games/,Five for Friday: Games,"Finland is synonymous with its thriving games scene. Here are five more reasons why. The likes of  ,   and Supercell made the world sit up and pay attention to the Finnish games scene. This quintet is ensuring interest remains high. After gaining worldwide fame with its  , this game studio set out to sway those who don’t believe in vaccinations. According to founder and CEO   its approach is all about learning by entertainment. “Games are superior to any other form of advertising because of their high level of engagement,”  . “If they’re used to educate and inform people, the impact can be huge.” 41 million US dollars is big bucks, no matter which way you look at it. Thanks to its runaway hit,  , big things are happening to this Small Giant – 41 million US dollars’ worth of big things. “The strong, data-driven entrepreneurial team had a clear vision of what it wanted to achieve, and it’s delivering on that,”  , partner at EQT Ventures,  . “Small Giant Games has achieved great traction and is determined to become a global winner.” Despite having zero experience in the field, the Kangaspeska sisters decided to go for their mobile game idea anyway – and the resultant rat and city-saving antics of   soon won them fans both in Finland and abroad. The collaborative nature of the local games scene also played a part. “The atmosphere and team spirit are really good in the field of gaming,”    . “Others aren’t seen as competitors, as we all want to see Finnish games do better and better.” Although at first glance this studio’s ice fishing game,  , may seem to be something of a niche title, it has managed to attract some widespread interest. “There have been lots of players from more exotic locations, like Japan, China, Spain and Brazil,” CEO    . “We didn’t expect it would be so successful. It’s fun to see that some players know how to do ice fishing, even though there is no ice or snow in wintertime in their area.” When we caught up with the company in 2016, they were best known for  . Now, with a  -themed app set to drop soon on the App Store, this may very well change. “We want to be a games studio that our customers can rely on with the content we provide,” CEO  . “What is common with our games is that they are always a little different than other products on the market. We are not producing a direct copy of trending games.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-wooden-products/,Five for Friday: Wooden products,"These Finnish companies are making wood work for them. Finland’s economy has long been propped up by harvesting the forest that populates 75 per cent of its land mass. Here are five ways in which wood forms the focus of Finnish innovation. The thin wooden shell produced by this company resonates strongly when played softly, thus allowing drummers to minimise the amount of energy expended when laying down a beat. A drum’s low, sustaining sound also has extra meaning for Kumu, with the company taking its name from the Finnish word to describe such. Fittingly, ‘kumu’ also refers to a certain sound made by thunderstorms. “I have done many unique patterns and finishes,”  . “Some have even wanted their kit to look like it is really old and beaten, even rusty. People are always so happy when they get their drums. They admire the finish and later have told me that they have stepped up levels with their playing.” This company’s selling point is Finnish wood, particularly curly birch. Aside from watches, Aarni also sells wooden sunglasses and wallets. “A wooden watch is really light, always warm and doesn’t make its wearer’s wrist sweat,”  . “Similarly, wooden eyeglasses are softer than plastic ones and, more than anything, they’re classy. It’d be difficult to copy the unique pattern of wood.” Fuelled by collaborations with Finnish design maestros, Nikari recently celebrated its 50th year of creating premium, sustainable solid-wood furniture. “We value timeless design and combine proven, traditional wooden joints with contemporary forms,”  . “Sustainability is very important to us. We mostly work with public premises, but our furniture is increasingly bought for private homes around the world.” This company has a wooden design item called The Seed, but it is perhaps best known for publishing a series of three wooden-themed books. These it describes as philosophical contemplations for adults, but in the form of illustrated children’s books. “I’ve read all kinds of texts in my life, and I can’t really explain what was so captivating about the [first book]    ,”  . “But it did stop me in my tracks and left me thinking.” This company started out by taking an artisan approach to protecting smartphones and has since seen demand for its products outweigh supply. Now its range has extended to include wallets, posters and sleeves made from felt. “In Finland, using wood is a genuinely ethical way to produce merchandise,”  . “The supply chains are sustainable, we use wood from certified forests and never resort to species of trees that are endangered.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mine-gungor-puts-the-cherry-on-top-of-an-outfit/,Mine Güngör puts the cherry on top of an outfit,"There’s no limit to what can inspire Finnish jewellery designer Mine Güngör. Her next collection might burst out of her pencil as she sits down to draw. On their own, pieces of jewellery don’t always look like much.   believes that the person wearing the piece is what finalises the artwork. The jewellery designs favour the decorative and detailed. “In a box, an earring isn’t ready and perfect yet,” she explains. “It’s only when it’s worn by someone that you can see the piece of jewellery become complete. To a designer, it’s fascinating to witness the work take its final form.” Güngör is a visual artist by training. As a student, she was free to explore all kinds of materials and tools, and that’s when she created her first jewellery designs. When they started selling well, she had to make a choice: whether to maintain designing as a hobby and focus on painting or seriously take on the budding jewellery business. As much as Güngör loves painting, there was one thing that helped her make up her mind. “As a painter, I’m much rougher. When I design jewellery, it’s all about details and functionality, and I love creating items that are made to be used, not just admired. It’s great to have so many channels, ways and tools to express myself.” The decision she made has borne fruit. In late 2016, three years after she had made and sold her first pieces, she was able to become a full-time jewellery entrepreneur, with eyes set on international markets. For Mine Güngör (pictured), drawing is essential. Although she takes holidays from running the business, she never takes a break from drawing. Güngör’s earrings and necklaces are decorative and filled with details. She finds inspiration wherever and whenever; following her child’s adventures in the world, in particular, has taught her that not everything has to look like something. “Even the strangest things can look good together,” she notes. “I’ve been able to let go of restrictions and just draw whatever it is that happens to come my way.” The first Mine Güngör jewellery piece was a necklace designed to resemble the face of her cat, which is still one of the brand’s most popular items. A new collection comes out twice a year, and the pieces have thus far included unicorns, flowers and avocados, with many designs coming in two sizes: smaller, called casual, and larger, known as statement. All the jewellery is made in Finland, using materials that are sourced from as near as possible. Many of the items are of Finnish birch, while some of the parts including holograms are ordered from the UK. The final products are assembled in Helsinki. Currently, Mine Güngör has various resellers in Finland and a couple in the US and Estonia, and its online store sends items all across the world. Güngör tells that while orders have been coming in from as far as Hawaii, the regular non-Finnish clients hail mainly from Spain and England. “People are fed up with low-quality, single use items that lack spirit and personality.” However, there are still plenty of regions to conquer. The next step for Güngör and her three-strong team of staff is to start visiting international fairs and expositions to spread the word. Social media is a good marketing platform for small brands, but Güngör believes that being able to see and touch the pieces is even better. She also thinks that the demand for products like Mine Güngör is on the rise, especially in Europe. “People are fed up with low-quality, single-use items that lack spirit and personality,” she points out. “Instead, what they’re looking for is sustainability and brands that are committed to ethical production and practices.” To manifest its values, Mine Güngör has been involved in collaborations with organisations like the Finnish Nature League and Savonlinna International Nature Film Festival. Güngör hopes there’ll be more opportunities for similar projects in the future. “They are fun and mutually beneficial – and everyone’s left with a smile on their face!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sumpli-is-on-the-job-for-gig-economy/,Sumpli is on the job for gig economy,"Someone needs a spare pair of hands, and someone else’s hands are looking for things to do. This Finnish platform brings the two together. In the modern world, people are used to urgency. Things need to happen  , not later. “Today, you can rent a boat or a cottage without first saving up money for years to buy one, watch movies instantly on streaming services, or even find yourself company right away on Tinder,” says   co-founder  . “People no longer need to own things.” Sumpli’s eyes are set on neighbouring countries and eventually all over Europe. Younes believes that this is a sign of the times: people don’t want to be anchored in a certain way of life but instead value their freedom. This applies to working life, too: many want to try different kinds of careers in their lifetime and leave plenty of room for leisure. “A lot of young people don’t want to settle for just a month’s summer vacation, fighting over the most popular weeks with colleagues,” Younes explains. “For them, it’s important to be able to choose when and where they’re working.” This is called the gig economy, meaning short-term contracts and freelance work instead of permanent full-time positions. It’s also what Finnish startup Sumpli wants to provide both companies and employees with – an opportunity to easily find workers and work. The idea behind Sumpli’s platform is to let employers advertise open vacancies, be it for one shift or more. Workers, for their part, can show their interest and availability with the touch of a button, without having to fill in cumbersome forms. All of this is free of charge – and potentially very, very fast. “At best, we’ve had a shift filled just 38 seconds after it was advertised,” tells Younes. Mehdi Younes knows plenty of people with successful careers who have wanted to do a bartending shift here and there through Sumpli – just for a change. For a fee, Sumpli can also deal with salaries, taxes and pensions, freeing entrepreneurs and companies to focus on their core business. “I know from experience how much hassle recruiting someone entails, even if it’s just for a short period of time,” Younes notes. “Sumpli can ensure that everything is done by the letter of the law and all expenses are taken care of.” Particularly in the hotel, restaurant and catering industry (horeca), companies rely heavily on temporary workforce. Serial entrepreneur Younes is fully aware of this, as his background is mainly in owning and running restaurants. That’s also why Sumpli first established itself in the service industry. Currently, it offers jobs in retail, horeca, cleaning and healthcare, but it’s by no means planning on getting stuck with just them. Younes wants Sumpli to become the go-to platform for workers and employers in all fields. “We want to   working life,” Younes tells, referring to the global ride-sharing service. “My goal is that at some point all companies and everyone of working age will be on Sumpli, and it’ll be where people go to offer and find jobs. Will that ever happen, that I don’t know, but that’s what we’re working towards.” The first steps in conquering the world have been taken in Finland, where Sumpli has over 10 000 registered jobseekers and hundreds of employers. Founded by Younes and two of his mates, who initially developed the service with no external money, the company landed 550 000 euros in seed funding in March. A further boost came from  , which pitched in an additional 250 000 euros in August. Sumpli’s plan is to head abroad, first to the Nordics and the Baltics and eventually all of Europe. The technology is in place, but local laws and regulations need to be carefully reviewed before entering new markets. At best, we’ve had a shift filled just 38 seconds after it was advertised. Younes sees Sumpli as a tool to help immigrants and foreigners enter working life, and also as a way to tackle the grey economy, as Sumpli ensures the legality of payments. Personally, he’s excited about the fact that workers using Sumpli can get paid instantly after their shift, as the payment process is fully automated. “High-interest fast loan companies piss me off,” he states. “A fast salary is a much better option to save people from falling into debt.” The more international Sumpli grows, the more alternatives its users will have. For example, backpackers could soon find gigs along their route and finance their travelling that way. “You could just by an Interrail ticket and stay on the road for longer by working whilst travelling,” Younes says. “Had there been a service like that when I was young… wow.”   is published by Finnfacts, which is a part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sessio-aims-to-take-video-contracts-mainstream/,Sessio aims to take video contracts mainstream,"With its innovative video-based solution, this Finnish company hopes to transform how we contract renovation and construction works. The app captures the audio and video, and allows the user to take still photos and draw on them. Renovations that go smoothly from beginning to end seem to be few and far between, and misunderstandings and missed deadlines may appear to be an unavoidable part of renovation works.  thinks it has a solution, and the company’s upcoming app could radically change how we contract construction and renovation services. The key to their solution are video contracts. The idea is straightforward: the Sessio app lets you record a local video or a video call where you describe the specifics of the works. The app captures the audio and video, and lets you take still photos and draw on them. Finally, you can merge the material into a video contract. Making the video takes therefore very little time, and it makes it possible to discuss and agree on the renovation project without both parties having to physically be where the works will take place. When it comes to construction and renovations, the buyer and the contracted company may draft a written contract, but it usually only outlines the works in broad strokes. “And as the works progress, there are always additional details that need to be agreed on,” says  , CEO and founder of Sessio. Usually such details are discussed orally, since writing everything down would take too long. But for one reason or another, things often don’t work out exactly as discussed or the works end up taking longer than expected, Westerholm says. “In those situations, we tend to just accept it and move on, especially as there is no record of what was originally said.” A video contract, created with Sessio’s app, changes this as it works as a record of the agreement. Westerholm hopes that this will help bring about a transformation of behavioural patterns, as a recording will encourage renovation companies to be precise with what they promise and deliver. Sessio has the capability to confirm verbal agreements. A video also helps clarify the specifics of the requested works, especially in situations where the person responsible for the actual renovations is different from the person who discussed them originally. “Ultimately both the client and the company benefit from this,” Westerholm says. “It really is a no-brainer.” Sessio is at the early stages of its journey, having a few part-time employees and no commercial product yet. But Westerholm believes that once construction site supervisors have a chance to try the app, they will quickly see its benefits and start using it at their sites. “When we’ve discussed the concept with construction companies, it has been immediately clear to them how it would help them make savings. Already the fact that it eliminates the need to drive to the location just to discuss the works means they save money.” The next version of the app, which adds a function to record solo videos, will be launched in November at  , and Westerholm is keen to get users’ comments once they get their hands on it: “We have a great concept, but it can still be shaped and sharpened based on feedback, and we’re open to suggestions.” As an architect, the constructions industry was a natural field for Westerholm to target. He encourages also others to keep their eyes open and identify similar opportunities for new apps and services. “We all carry portable devices that are always connected and have highly sophisticated tech. This allows for entirely new kinds of services, and I’m sure there’s still massive untapped potential for new ideas.”"

All good things come in twos, right? Well, this week we decided to follow up our   with another five of the best in the field from Finland. This fresh fintech startup wants to bring change to the dull aftermaths of shared Friday dinners. Spurred by the endless chats about ‘who bought what’ and ‘who owes whom’, the company embarked on a mission to make everyday finance fun. “Finance is often seen as challenging, boring, complicated – everything but fun – so our motto is to change that,” co-founder  . “We want to highlight that anyone can be a banker in their own community and that finance management can be a social experience.” You say ‘money’, this company says ‘Moni’. Founded on the idea of taking a 21st-century approach to consumer finance, the company has developed a platform that allows users to make payments, send and receive money, and link a debit or credit card to a Moni account. Even salaries can be deposited to a user’s account, which they can access via a prepaid Mastercard. “Our big vision is that our technology makes it possible to have a ‘banking’ account on any mobile phone for any person on the planet,”   CEO and founder  . Mash handles consumers’ financial obligations so that businesses can benefit from being paid instantly and focus on serving their customers. “We think of ourselves as the third option at point of sale,”   CEO  , after inking a lucrative deal with Verifone. “Today’s in-store financing solutions are not seen as a source of competitive advantage by business owners. They are hard to use and create a large degree of friction at point of sale.” Specialising in developing credit management and invoicing service solutions for B2B e-commerce, Enterpay has set out to expand its operations to other Nordic countries after securing an investment from Swedish NFT Ventures last year. The news was seen as an important step for the company “as [NFT] can support our international growth not only through its investment but also through its knowhow and international networks,” CEO  . This company saves time and reduces financial burden by ensuring that money flows seamlessly between banks and businesses in Europe.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/made-of-sundays-is-not-just-another-sticker-on-the-wall/,Made of Sundays is not just another sticker on the wall,"Finnish company Made of Sundays wants to cheer up homes and offices with colours and shapes made of ecological materials. Stick it up and wear a smile! In his designs, Thomas Leppä tries to consider all kinds of tastes and environments from kids’ bedrooms to office spaces. If you ask  , co-founder of  , studying abroad is a great idea. His two exchange periods in Austria and Canada shaped his future in various ways, not least because in Austria he met his now-wife, Spaniard  . They’re also business partners. However, the romance started a lot before Made of Sundays saw daylight; Bordes Sola had already made the move to Finland when the idea came about. “Alba went on a work trip to the UK and brought back wall decals of Space Invaders,” Leppä recalls. “They were pretty much spot-on the kind of stuff we like: simple, colourful and cheerful.” The couple started looking for more patterns and options to add some colour to their home. It turned out that a lot of the alternatives were just cheesy texts, and the materials were of low quality, falling off the wall in a month or two. The idea came up: what if we made better and nicer ones ourselves? “For years, it was something we just talked about half-seriously,” Leppä says. “It was only when Alba wanted to quit her then-day job that we figured we really should give it a proper go.” Of the many business ideas the couple had been pondering over, Made of Sundays felt the best. The company was founded five years ago, and Leppä says it’s something that went from half a joke to a full-on business in 2017. The company’s fun approach is opening doors worldwide. Instead of the tacky ’Live, Laugh, Love’ decals and posters, Made of Sundays focuses on cheerful and colourful patterns and images. Leppä says that the goal is to let people decorate their homes in an easy and affordable way – that isn’t permanent. The decals being removable means that if the habitant ever gets bored of the style, the decals can be taken down and moved from one room or house to another if needed. Made of Sundays also wants to keep its production as eco-friendly as possible. Leppä notes that all materials are chosen based on their environmental impact and durability, and he believes that Made of Sundays is if not the only, at least one of the few companies in the world producing wall decals from paper. “We always try to get creative and think outside the box when it comes to new materials,” Leppä tells. “Of course, not buying anything at all is the most ecological choice, but when it comes to decorating a home, our decals are a much better choice than PVC plastic or paint.” Made of Sundays is run by its owners in Helsinki, and Bordes Sola’s sister has a little local operation in Spain. In general, most things from designs and drawings to packing and shipping are on the couple’s shoulders. Made of Sundays comprises wall decal business and Leppä’s consultancy work, all running under the same company name. The vast majority of sales come through the webshop and other online platforms, such as Etsy. Leppä points out that due to the vast and varied offering, it would be difficult for resellers to order just the right amount or just the right size. Hence, the company is moving into new markets through its online presence and social media. Most orders come in from Finland, North America, the UK, Benelux and France. Another interesting region is Australia, where Leppä sees plenty of potential if only distribution was a little less of a hassle than it is now. Despite plentiful plans for reaching out to new markets, right now the focus is on expanding the product portfolio and creating new designs and concepts. As soon as that’s done, scalability is the next step. Leppä and his spouse are pretty busy with other stuff, too. “For now, our baby takes up a lot of our time,” Leppä says, “so we’re not particularly rushing anything at the minute.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bilot-adds-intelligence-to-ict/,Bilot adds intelligence to ICT,"“Life is what happens when you’re busy doing ICT,” says Finnish digital service company Bilot. The growing company digitalises businesses intelligently to leave more time for life. Quality, not quantity.  , founded in 2005, is based on the idea of not only getting things done, but getting them done  . “Back in the day, the ERP (enterprise resource planning) market was a little overheated and the quality of consulting services started to erode,” says  , CEO of Bilot. “In general, large consultancies no longer focused on quality and, instead, delivered commodities and volume.” Bilot’s co-founders, some of them long-time friends of Tanner, didn’t want to do business in which the quality of work was not paramount. Completely owned by its employees, the company promises to design and deliver the best digital solutions by people who enjoy their work and are keen to learn and develop themselves further. The idea has sold well. When Tanner joined the company in 2011, there were about 50 employees and now the number is about 150. We provide intelligent customer-facing solutions, such as pricing and profitability optimisation, that are strongly data-driven. Bilot’s core offering of digital solutions is based on two dimensions: customer journey and advanced analytics. According to Tanner, the largest fields of the company’s business are e-commerce solutions, customer relationship management and marketing automation tools, and other innovative digital solutions needed to support all stages of a customer journey. The key differentiating factor lies in the latter layer. Bilot specialises in charging its solutions with advanced analytics, AI and genuinely end-to-end technical integration. “We provide intelligent customer-facing solutions, such as pricing and profitability optimisation, that are strongly data-driven,” Tanner explains. “Beginning from data architecture and basic reporting all the way to prescriptive analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, that’s Bilot’s forte.” Bilot’s solutions are mostly built on existing and widely used software, such as those of SAP and Microsoft. “We work with leading cloud-native software platforms, and, with our industry expertise and acclaimed technology acumen, customers can attain better competitiveness.” Under Mika Tanner, Bilot has grown and internationalised. Bilot has also launched its own range of products known as Bilot SmartSeries. SmartChannel boosts companies’ omnichannel commerce, SmartMDM supports efficient and lean data management, and SmartPricing helps in real-time pricing optimisation. In the future, Tanner sees artificial intelligence being embedded in IT solutions as the new normal. Bilot is, among others, developing ways to utilise it in its solution offering – avoiding unnecessary hype and saluting pragmatism. “There’s definitely an industry-wide drive to integrate new solutions enabled by artificial intelligence into every business.” Some five years ago, Bilot came to the same conclusion as plenty of other Finnish companies: the home market is only so big. Projects had already taken the company all over the world, but then it decided to set foot in Poland as a local operator, benefiting from the competitive advantages it has developed in Finland. The next step is to establish a subsidiary in Sweden. Plenty of Bilot’s customers are present in the market, and they’ve been asking Bilot to come along to support them. “They’re in need of an agile partner with a value proposition like ours,” notes Tanner. “We feel like now is the right time to go, and we can also utilise some of the lessons we’ve learned in Poland.” The potential subsequent markets will be decided once Sweden has been conquered – but Sweden, as Tanner points out, is a big chunk to bite off in itself, as it’s very different to Finland and Poland. “In Sweden, the market position of SAP is not nearly as prominent as in Finland, and there’s a large and vibrant mid-market which can be really interesting for a mid-sized player like Bilot,” he explains. “Thus, we see plenty of growth potential, and with our story and excellent references I believe we stand a realistic chance to do well.” Bilot is headed to Sweden with a changing market in mind."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/belightful-s-butterfly-oasis-takes-flight/,Belightful’s Butterfly Oasis takes flight,"Where have all the butterflies gone? Finnish startup Belightful Design is bringing them back to our gardens with award-winning design.  Nature is a great source of wellbeing for people, believe   and  . That is why the two founders of ecological design company   are on a mission to improve the connection between people and nature. Their first target? Butterflies. “About half of Europe’s butterfly population has been lost in the past 25 years,” explains Liesegang. “There are many reasons for this, but a major one is that their living environment is getting smaller. For example, in the UK almost 90 per cent of all natural fields have disappeared since the World War II.” The Butterfly Oasis butterfly feeder has received accolades for its eco-friendly material and design, including a mention in British Vogue. Belightful Design is doing its bit to change these numbers. In 2017 the company launched the Butterfly Oasis, a feeder which can be hung in a garden or a balcony and filled with nectar to nourish butterflies. While the oasis isn’t the first feeder on the market, Liesegang says it is the only one made from oil-free, recyclable material. In addition, its droplet-shaped design not only looks good but helps to keep other insects away from the nectar. The Butterfly Oasis’ eco-friendly design hasn’t gone unnoticed. In 2016, it was named the best sustainable business idea at Nordic interior design fair Formex and, in 2017, the oasis was chosen to be part of the prestigious garden event Chelsea Flower Show in London. The feeder has even been mentioned in the British edition of the fashion bible  . But the inspiration for the Butterfly Oasis came from a long way from the fashion world. As a designer, Liesegang always wanted to create products which are good for nature’s wellbeing, and butterflies as pollinators are essential for its biodiversity. She started to sketch a butterfly feeder back in 2009, but the time wasn’t right. “The world was very different then,” Liesegang says. “But when the startup buzz and natural values started to take over newspaper headlines a few years ago, I started to think there could be a real need for this kind of product.” She wasn’t wrong. Since Belightful Design was founded in 2016, the company has raised around 300 000 euros in funding, declined investment offers on Finnish Dragon’s Den (due to the investment terms) and expanded the Butterfly Oasis to 10 countries in Europe. “There is always talk about bees, because they are big business, but butterflies are also important pollinators. They play a major role in guarding nature’s biodiversity,” says Miia Liesegang. Despite spreading its wings in Continental Europe and starting small-scale pilots in the US, it is the UK which remains Beligthful Design’s key market. At least for now. “There is a robust gardening culture in the UK and the market is a good size for us,” Liesegang explains. “Also, butterfly conservation is a big thing there.” Belightful Design has already found a partner in Butterfly Conservation, a British charity devoted to saving butterflies, moths and their habitats. The partnership is a good stepping stone for the company as Butterfly Conservation is one of the largest organisations of its kind in the world. But Belightful Design isn’t stopping at butterflies. Its long-term plan is to find an international partner to take the company to the next level and expand its product portfolio. “We believe the wellbeing of people and nature are closely interlinked. We aim to launch further products that improve this connection,” Liesegang concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/klever-app-puts-paper-bills-into-the-past/,Klever app puts paper bills into the past,"No more lost bills or missed due dates. Finnish startup Klever wants to eradicate paper bills with its groundbreaking mobile application for easy bill payments and consumer financing. Paying bills can be a pain. Despite our good intentions, due dates get forgotten, paper bills misplaced and email bills lost in a full inbox. Cue a distraught consumer and a company spending time and money chasing a late payment. But Finnish startup   believes it has a solution for both parties: mobile invoices. “It is incredible, but today there aren’t really any options for paying bills other than a bank account,” says  , head of communications at Klever. “We are introducing a mobile platform for this. You don’t have to go to your online or mobile bank anymore to pay bills.” How the Klever app works is simple. It gathers all of a user’s bills into the same service, sets due date reminders and allows payments to be confirmed with fingerprint authentication. The user verifies their bills with the app by forwarding an email bill or taking a picture of a paper bill, and all subsequent invoices are then sent to the app automatically. You don’t have to go to your online or mobile bank anymore to pay bills. Even this step will soon be automated. In July, Klever announced a partnership with PostNord Strålfors, the largest invoice distributor in the Nordics. PostNord will start to offer Klever as a new mobile invoice channel to its over 60 000 corporate customers in Finland as of late 2018. For consumers, this means a smoother payment process, while businesses benefit from cost-efficient invoicing and faster payments. “[In future] when you start to use the Klever app you can just click and choose for all your bills to be delivered there,” Muurikainen enthuses. “This will happen through integrations with invoice distributors, so you don’t have to manually add any bills to the app anymore.” Behind Klever are two Finnish serial entrepreneurs,   and  . They started to wonder why bills are often paid at the last moment or late and how the process could be made smoother. This is when the idea for mobile invoices was born. The duo were quick to set the ball rolling. Klever was founded in 2016, the app was soft-launched in late 2017, and it has been downloaded nearly 40,000 times since. The app has also caught the eye of investors. Klever has raised close to 4.5 million euros in funding to date, including 1.5 million euros through an   on  . Klever’s mobile app gathers all bills into a single service, sets due date reminders, offers easy payment confirmation and soon also financing options. This money and Klever’s 10-person team have been put to work on a broader launch of the app in early 2019. The new options include the ability to move up due dates, split payments into smaller instalments and access other consumer financing options, while invoices are still paid on their due date. The first to offer these services with Klever is credit management company Lindorff. Klever is also discussing similar financing and integration partnerships with other Nordic banks and invoice distributors. For now, Klever’s focus is on building its customer base and partnerships in Finland, but the long-term goal is to expand across Europe. “We aim to create scale and reference cases with our Nordic partners. This will make it easier to take our partnership model to new markets,” Muurikainen says. “The volume of paper bills remains a universal problem. In Europe alone, around 18 billion bills are sent to consumers annually and 80 per cent of them are on paper.” The issue isn’t only the cost of sending and processing paper invoices, or how easily they get lost, but the lack of customer interaction they provide. This is why Klever already has plans to expand its service beyond bills. “After we have completed the financing side, we can build a new mobile channel on top of it for invoicing companies to offers other services, like contract upgrades. This won’t happen tomorrow, but it is where we are heading in the future,” Muurakainen concludes."

What’s the use of a great business idea, if you don’t have the people on board to help make it a reality? These Finnish solutions tackle various aspects of staffing with gusto. Decades of research inform this company’s HR testing and assessment questionnaire WOPI, which measures the motives, thinking and attitude drivers of competence. With it, users are able to help reskill a workforce challenged by new competency requirements caused by digitalisation. “We focus on the less-changing competencies driven by age-old psychological drivers,” CEO    . “I could go back to the Stone Age, administer WOPI and find the same type of people we find today. There would be hunters driven by competition, leaders driven by leadership motives and shamans driven by intuitive thinking.” Seeking your dream job is, well, the dream of many. But how many times has your enthusiasm for an open position been met with a chasm of silence? Have no fear, for clear and fully personalised feedback is here. This company provides recruiting tools for internationalising businesses and focuses on developing greater recruitment communications.   has also boosted its fortunes. “Recruiting is full of crazy customs and takes hours of your time,”   CTO  . “It’s pretty inefficient and we want to fix that.” Improving companies’ productivity levels is a cinch for VibeCatch, by pointing out the wellbeing and strengths of employees to management and HR teams. This meets the need for more frequent employee feedback and engagement data. “With this knowledge, business leaders now have a deeper understanding of sentiment across their workforce, enabling them to take appropriate action to solve specific issues before they get bigger and more damaging to the business as a whole,”   CEO and co-founder  . This company specialises in facilitating pre-recorded video interviews, with the goal of enabling recruiters to see the real person behind each application. “I haven’t heard of anyone being brilliant on the video and then really nervous face-to-face,” former CEO     when the company was still known as Recruitby.net. “Videos tend to give a relatively accurate image. Many candidates like making the videos, because they offer a better opportunity for presenting yourself than a written cover letter.” It’s not all about saving time by engaging potential staff members with video interviews, though. RecRight’s applicant tracking system offers a tool for publishing jobs, receiving applications and collaborating with colleagues. Years ago  and his consulting company Wakaru created an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, an automated process for handling all possible aspects of organising a training event. Around the same time, he noticed that even big corporations were beginning to look for small and agile training providers to update staff on changing technology. “We figured it’d make sense to bring both big and small training houses together in a cost-effective way,”  . Combining the logic of an online store and Wakaru’s initial ERP, Oppia.fi was launched to serve as a platform and technology provider for companies that already operate in the field of training. “Oppia.fi is a business case that proves that the platform works,” he said."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/frozenbyte-prepares-for-lift-off/,Frozenbyte prepares for lift-off,"Finnish game developer Frozenbyte is set to enter the big league of video gaming with its upcoming project. Start small and slowly build your way up. Few companies exemplify this approach as well as  , an independent game developer based in Helsinki. The company released its first game, the sci-fi shooter  , in 2005 and has since then gone on to develop a broad range of games, with genres varying from rogue-like strategy to fantasy action. It is perhaps best known among gamers for the   series, a trilogy of fantasy adventure games that combine platforming and puzzles, the first of which was released in 2009. But compared to its previous projects, the company’s upcoming title is clearly its most ambitious to date, offering hundreds of hours of playtime and including support for massive multiplayer gaming. For now, the company is keeping further details about the game under wraps and has not even revealed its name yet, saying only that it will be set in space. But if the technology that powers the game is anything to go by, gamers should prepare for a truly novel experience. The company has released 14 different games so far. What has allowed Frozenbyte to take on a project of such massive scale is its updated game engine, the software that the company uses to create its games. The new version of the engine, which was developed with funding from  , includes advanced tech the firm calls “vertex/voxel hybrid rendering”. This, in simple terms, allows for an entirely dynamic damage modelling that enables the game world to change extremely precisely and in real time when, for example, spaceships collide. Frozenbyte’s CEO,  , had in fact come up with the idea for the game years ago, but only now technology has reached the point where creating it is possible. “Thanks to our engine, the production values of our new game will be comparable to any AAA title,” says  , marketing manager at Frozenbyte. The game will be ready for an early-access release by the end of this year, and when the final version launches (date to be confirmed) the company is confident that it will make a splash. “What we’re doing is something completely new, and we’re sure that the gaming community will be excited to try it out,” says Tuovinen. “We expect that already the early-access version will get at least hundreds of thousands of players, so we really want to hit the sweet spot in terms of content and timing.” With this project in the pipeline, what does the current gaming landscape look like for an independent game developer such as Frozenbyte? According to Tuovinen, two parallel developments are shaping the industry currently. “Multiplayer games are clearly a huge trend, and especially battle royale games such as   are all the rage right now,” he says. “But at the same time, many players yearn for strong single-player experiences.” With a team of 120 employees, Frozenbyte is a relatively small game developer considering the scope of its latest project. When the new game launches, however, the company plans to increase its staff “pretty massively”, Tuovinen says. But at the same time, the firm wants to hold on to its very distinct philosophy. “We try to let employees choose freely what games they work on,” says Tuovinen. “We’ve noticed that having this freedom is a great morale and motivation booster, so we aim to develop this policy even further in the future.” Released in late 2017, Nine Parchments is a “co-operative blast’em up game of magic mayhem”."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/one-click-lca-helps-build-for-a-liveable-future/,One Click LCA helps build for a liveable future,"One Click LCA automates the analysis of environmental impacts from existing design data while ensuring compliance with any certification scheme. The revolutionary model of One Click LCA has clearly resonated with the global green building community, and recently the software was selected as the winner of the Energy Globe Award for Finland in 2018. This prestigious award, also dubbed the Nature’s Nobel Prize, is an annual prize granted by the Energy Globe Foundation to extraordinary sustainability projects. “With more than 180 countries and 6 000 projects submitted for consideration, we are very proud about this award,” Pasanen enthuses. Did you know that buildings and construction are responsible for 40 per cent of carbon emissions globally and that those emissions accumulate throughout the building’s whole life cycle? This is why Finnish software company Bionova developed  , an easy-to-use software for designing and building in an environmentally sustainable way. LCA stands for life-cycle assessment, which allows companies to evaluate the environmental impact of construction projects and products. “For example, if you want to know how your building will influence climate change during its entire existence, LCA can give you the answer,” explains  , the CEO of Bionova. LCA is being increasingly demanded by investors, governments and certifications as a science-based evaluation method for green buildings. A new type of software was much needed, however, as performing LCAs used to be quite a tricky business. “There were no fast, affordable LCA tools,” Pasanen says. LCA studies might have cost up to 15 000 euros and taken up to 150 hours, potentially delaying the construction process and slowing the uptake of LCA. The requirements laid out in different construction certifications and regulations also vary. “We automated the tedious analysis from existing design data and building information models and made it so fast and easy that you can be ready in just minutes,” Pasanen explains. CEO Panu Pasanen. With the LCA report, architects and builders can see where the hotspots for carbon footprint and other environmental impacts lie, and intervene to fix those issues. “It is also very easy to check which design changes would help reduce the environmental impact, as our software is incorporated into some of the biggest building design software used globally.” Ultimately One Click LCA helps designers and managers in the construction business make better choices, saving time and money besides the environment. Therefore, it is no wonder that Bionova now has clients in over 50 countries and is currently the market leader of construction LCA software in Europe. Major clients include the state of Norway, Skanska and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. “Generally speaking we have clients in countries where there is a lot of construction and a strong interest in sustainability,” Pasanen explains. One Click LCA was developed in 2011, and by now it has the biggest LCA database of building materials in the world. “This means our software can be used for calculations anywhere in the world. If you want to build a house in Seattle, for example, we can provide tailored, accurate metrics based on local construction products and applicable regulations.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bandimal-s-animals-make-music-fun-for-kids/,Bandimal’s animals make music fun for kids,"Children love making music, but there are more ear-friendly alternatives than banging on pots and pans. Finnish music composition app Bandimal lets children create their own catchy tunes without any musical knowledge.  How   works is simple. Start a new composition on the mobile app and a cartoon animal representing an instrument appears on the screen. Tap and a new animal joins in. Soon there is a trio of cute creatures bopping, bouncing and swelling up and down to the tune you just created. Colourful bars under the animals can be used to alter the melody, while various icons and dials let you add effects, switch tempo, set up drums and swipe between different animals. Bandimal is the creation of designer Lucas Zanotto (left), software developer Ilari Niitamo and sound designer Ulrich Troyer (not pictured). We tried to design a tool that introduces the joy of making music to kids. There is no need to learn notes – kids can jump right in and compose music,” explains  , designer and founder of  , the company behind  . “We designed everything in a way that whatever you do it will sound right. There is no failure, no right or wrong, just pure fun.” It is fun that seems to appeal to kids and adults alike. Yatatoy doesn’t reveal numbers but says since its release in late 2017   has found fans across the globe, particularly in the US and Asia. Even some DJs use the app to create mixes. The iOS app has also been lauded by major media titles such as   and   and by Apple itself. In June, it was one of the 10 winners at the Apple Design Awards. “They are like the Oscars of the Apple industry. It was a huge thing for us,” enthuses  , software developer at Yatatoy.  is Yatatoy’s fourth mobile app. The Helsinki-based company was founded in 2012 by Zanotto to create playful, creative toys for kids. In the company’s first app,  , hand-drawn animals help kids to learn the alphabet. The same visual theme has continued in the company’s other apps   and  , two children books and now  . Bandimal is targeted at children, but even DJs use the music composer app to create mixes. “From a child’s point of view, many apps have a distracting amount of content and colours. Our style is more minimalistic. We always bring something new, but in a way that is easy to understand,” Niitamo explains. “We don’t like adults coddling kids too much. We don’t do hand holding [in our apps]; learning happens through play and experimentation.” Furthermore, all text is replaced by intuitive interfaces in Yatatoy’s apps. This makes for a time-consuming design process –  , for example, was two years in the making – but Niitamo emphasises that speed isn’t a priority for the company. Nor is geographical location. Italian-born Zanotto and Finn Niitamo are based in Helsinki, while the company’s sound designer,  , lives in Vienna, and previous software developer,  , in Berlin. Working together happens remotely. “Clear roles help in this and everyone is in charge of their own field,” Niitamo says. “This is important as none of us do this full time, everyone has their own companies as well.” The trio is expanding the Yatatoy brand with books, music and a TV series. The borderless structure seems to be working for Yatatoy. Currently, the company is working on a new feature for  , which will allow kids to direct their own music videos within the app. The company also continues to expand its animal-themed product assortment. “We are starting to work on our fifth app,” says Zanotto. “We will expand the Yatatoy brand with books, music and more media – we are aiming for a TV series as well.” Niitamo reveals the company is already looking at a few opportunities with TV production companies. But no matter the medium, Yatatoy will continue its focus on children as for Niitamo they are both the most rewarding and demanding audience. “I like how receptive kids are. But, on the other hand, their feedback can be brutal. Kids either like or don’t like something, there is no room for excuses,” Niitamo says with a laugh."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/x-akseli-is-just-what-the-doctor-ordered-for-anxious-patients/,X-akseli is just what the doctor ordered for anxious patients,"Espoo-based X-akseli promises to deliver benefits to patients, hospitals and medical staff alike with its advanced customer flow management system, AKSELI. “The urologist is ready to see you now!” is undoubtedly an announcement most men would prefer not to hear after their name has been called in the congested waiting room of a hospital. Luckily many of the annoying, embarrassing and frustrating aspects traditionally associated with medical appointments are disappearing as hospitals and healthcare centres are adopting digital solutions to manage their patient and customer flows. “Patients are traditionally asked to come in well ahead of time to make sure they’re in the waiting room when the physician is ready for them. The hospital is basically conceding that it has no idea when you’ll be treated and when you’ll get to go home,” tells  , the CEO of  . “We make it easier by giving you a more accurate estimate of when you’ll get to go home.” Ours has been the most advanced and valuable system on the market, and it has also created the most value for its users X-akseli has grown rapidly into the leading provider of healthcare-related customer flow management solutions in Finland, boasting a clientele of 70 local governments and hospital districts. After reporting a 24 per cent uptick in net sales and featuring yet again on   in 2017, it acquired the patient self-registration business of what used to be one of its two main rivals,  , in spring 2018. “Ours has been the most advanced and valuable system on the market, and it has also created the most value for its users,” states Argillander. “We’re proud to be able to make a living doing this. It hasn’t been easy getting to this point. We don’t have big cash coffers. Our own pockets have set the limits for us as our growth has been internally funded.” Argillander is grateful particularly to the   (OYS), which selected the fledgling, two-year-old startup as the supplier of its smart but still limited patient self-registration system around 2010. “OYS was huge for us,” he acknowledges. “We suddenly found ourselves wandering along the 50 kilometres of corridors at OYS. That was how it started.” The clientele has since grown to include the   (TAYS), the   (LSHP) and, most recently, the   (HUS). “We’re still a small company, and in light of the healthcare market’s size there’s still room for growth in Finland. But we anticipate that we’ll also have to find markets elsewhere,” says Argillander. AKSELI is used for 95 per cent of all reservations at the Oulu University Hospital (OYS). Patient self-registration, however, is only one aspect of a comprehensive customer flow management system such as X-akseli’s AKSELI. Argillander says the system essentially guides patients through any number of medical tests and procedures, while enabling the service provider to utilise its resources more efficiently. “The process starts with a nurse or physician deciding what you need. We have nothing to do with that, but as soon as it has been decided that you need a knee surgery and a pre-surgery scan, for example, our system steps in, telling what’d be the most efficient time and place for the procedures,” he explains. “It basically brings the customer, equipment and healthcare professional together in a room at the optimal time.” AKSELI, he adds, is also the only system on the market that is capable of informing laboratory technicians which patients to prioritise based on when they are scheduled to meet a physician to discuss the test results. The benefits offered by the system are manifold. AKSELI improves staff cost efficiency by performing clerical tasks to ensure nurses and physicians can concentrate on medical procedures rather than routine tasks, such as asking patients for contact details, and by guiding patients to the nearest waiting room and informing the medical staff of their arrival to ensure the staff do not have to rummage the corridors for a particular patient. “That’s good for boosting morale among nurses and physicians,” tells Argillander. “It’s also a big deal if a nurse or physician has to wait for a patient for 20 minutes. It may not even be possible to get a physician to a small locality for more than a few hours at a time.” Patients, in turn, appreciate both the higher level of privacy afforded by the more discreet way in which they are called in from the waiting room and the lower level of anxiety afforded by knowledge that they are in the right waiting room – particularly if they have come in for an important test or procedure. AKSELI is also a treasure trove of data that hospitals and healthcare centres can use to analyse, develop and optimise their operations, according to Argillander. “You can use it to simulate the operations of a hospital and determine, for example, where the bottlenecks would be if the number of customers grew threefold. The system reveals all sorts of development needs in the healthcare system,” he says. X-akseli has received positive feedback for its consultative approach and readiness to say no if necessary, tells CEO Janne Argillander."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/koepala-creates-guilt-free-ways-to-enjoy-takeaway/,Koepala creates guilt-free ways to enjoy takeaway,"This Finnish developer of sustainable packaging solutions for takeaway food is gearing up for market launch in the UK and Benelux countries. It may come as a bit of a surprise to realise that takeaway food is linked closely to not one but two major global issues. Takeaway food is gaining popularity as scores of people are leaving the countryside in search of a more fast-paced and around-the-clock lifestyle under the bright lights of metropolitan cities, where meals are ostensibly gobbled down while rushing through the lobby of a skyscraper to the street to hail a taxi. The containers and utensils left over from the perfunctory feat are then crammed into the nearest rubbish bin so routinely that it suggests an ignorance of the plastic waste problem the world is grappling with. The attitudinal climate is fortunately changing, and consumers, companies and governments in growing numbers are taking action to reduce plastic pollution. CEO Janne Asikainen says the packaging solution is needed particularly in sectors where ready-made meals must be transported from one place to another as efficiently as possible. One such company is  , a Helsinki-based developer of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions for takeaway food. “Our long-term goal is to truly change the current throw-away culture that is symbolised so concretely by fast-food containers,” proclaims  , the CEO at Koepala. “Our innovations aim at facilitating a move towards a waste-free fast-food culture, where the containers and raw materials are not reduced to waste but recycled one way or the other so that their value is preserved.” He reminds that what is needed are not only more sustainable packaging materials but also a comprehensive shift away from the prevalent consumption culture and attitudes. “If we stick to our linear and single-use approach to packaging and materials, it’ll be unsustainable regardless of the material as the production inputs will be lost over the couple of steps it takes you to order a meal in a restaurant, eat at the nearest table and chuck the container into a rubbish bin,” he explains. Koepala, he tells, sees itself as a packaging-oriented innovation agency that develops, tests and commercialises the best solutions, and provides them to businesses dealing with both food and logistics. “Our first clients are from the travel catering industry. For instance, airline catering companies say 80 per cent of their business is about logistics and the rest about food,” says Asikainen. “But regardless of whether you’re a packaging manufacturer, food producer, catering company or fast-food brand, we can give you an extra hand in packaging development,” he adds. “For instant food producers, it’s logistically absurd to send cups of noodles that are half full of air just so that it’s easy to add water. The benefits are significant if you remove the air from the logistics process.” Koepala’s patent-protected packaging solution is flat and rollable to dramatically reduce storage space needs. Koepala’s first attempt at an answer is a patented eco-friendly and multi-purpose packaging solution called Aterimo. The solution has been designed to replace all the cups, bowls, plates, trays and other takeaway containers – as well as any additional caps, lids and sleeves – in use today, while substantially reducing the need for raw materials and storage space. “Our rollable packaging reduces storage space needs to one-tenth when compared to stackable alternatives. The amount of raw material needed for a single packaging is equal to that needed for the lid of a disposable salad bowl. We’re able to reduce the need for raw materials in the first stage by as much as 50 per cent compared to existing solutions,” tells Asikainen. Aterimo is slated for its launch in the UK and Benelux countries by late 2019. “The product we’ll be launching is made of plastic-free, fibre-like material. We also tested different compostable films and composite materials but decided to go in an even more environment-friendly direction.” However, the solution is not all about creating resource savings for catering services, fast-food restaurants and instant food producers, or the logistics providers involved in delivering the food to consumers. Nor is it even all about reducing the environmental impact of such commercial activity. “We want to offer these improvements in efficiency without taking anything away from the enjoyable dining experience,” Asikainen states."

VAI-KØ’s name is a reference to the Finnish word vai (or), meaning that there are alternatives to the current status quo in fashion. “We want to combine functionality and style,” explains VAI-KØ co-founder and CEO  . “Whether you’re chilling in Kallio [a hipster district in central Helsinki], or hiking or skiing out and about, you can wear the same beanie.” Beanies are what VAI-KØ, an ethical and ecological design brand founded by Vanonen and his wife  , are most known for. However, these days the brand’s offering includes shirts, sunglasses, bags, caps and scarves, all designed by Maria Vanonen. The business idea can be traced back to two unhappy shoppers. A fair few years ago, the Vanonens were looking for environmentally sound fashion but found most designs a tad too hippy to their liking. “We couldn’t really find ecological clothes that tickled our fancy in terms of style,” Henri Vanonen recalls. “As Maria was studying industrial design and I was a business student, we figured it’d make sense if we tried filling the gap ourselves.” VAI-KØ was officially founded in 2014, with the aim of making every single step of the production process as sustainable and transparent as possible – without compromising on how trendy the clothes look. When it comes to ethical and ecological manufacturing, the textile industry receives a lot of bad press, and most of the time for good reason. VAI-KØ wants to lead by example: its merino wool is bluesign and GOTS-certified, coming from Argentinian farms. The final products are knit and sewn in Finland. All other production takes place in Europe, apart from VAI-KØ canvas bags, which are made in Pakistan and carry a CSR certificate. The company wants to do everything in its power to ensure its effect on the environment is as small as possible and it improves the life of people working with the product during its life cycle. Henri Vanonen points out that there are already a lot of choices when it comes to transparent fashion, and consumers are slowly but surely taking note. He hopes that, one day, ethical production will be the new normal. Henri Vanonen and Yoda “It definitely is a growing field,” he says. “We, too, want to encourage people to buy less stuff but to make sure that the little stuff they buy is of high quality and durable so that, essentially, we really just need less of it.” In 2015, Henri Vanonen was involved in a side project, developing and producing 100 per cent recyclable skateboards with the help of a crowdfunding campaign. The Finnish-made Uitto boards are made of polypropylene and wood fibres. Now, the skateboard business is part of VAI-KØ. Vanonen deems it a good fit, as both brands share the same values. Eco-friendly ambitions aren’t the only things Uitto Boards and VAI-KØ have in common. Vanonen thinks that the Nordics, Germany, Switzerland and North America would be fruitful markets for both boards and clothes, as they also happen to be regions that are known for now a relatively high density of snowboarders, freeskiers – and skateboarders. “Outdoorsy yet urban people are definitely our main target group,” Vanonen notes. Currently, the couple share their responsibilities pretty evenly. The autumn collection is about to hit the stores, and on top of planning new products and designs the entrepreneurs are aiming to expand their international reach. At the moment, VAI-KØ products are available abroad through its online store, but the plan is to find new resellers at fairs across Europe and beyond. When VAI-KØ was founded, a lot of environment-friendly clothes didn’t appeal to the Vanonens’ sense of fashion."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/confoot-gives-container-handling-new-legs/,ConFoot gives container handling new legs,"Handling a 30-tonne shipping container is typically a task for heavy-duty equipment. This Finnish transport innovation makes it a one-person job. The shipping industry transports over 90 per cent of global trade. Every day, millions of containers are used to carry everything from foodstuff to car parts. And every day the trucks and drivers transporting these containers are stuck for hours or even days waiting for a container to be unloaded at its end-destination. But now this wait could be over. Finnish logistics company   has developed (and patented) detachable, portable legs for shipping containers to stay on. Timo Akela has been working on the idea of shipping container legs since the early 2000s. “The idea is that anyone driving a truck can attach the legs to a container alone, by lowering it onto the legs [using the truck’s air-suspension], and drive the truck away,” explains  , global sales manager at ConFoot. “The legs are very easy to use, and no investment in training is required.” This might not sound a revolutionary concept, but it can bring significant cost and time savings. Leaving a container on ConFoot’s legs frees up trucks and drivers for more deliveries while warehouses don’t have to pay for their wait time or invest in expensive container handling equipment. While the idea behind ConFoot’s legs is simple, their development has been far from it. In the early 2000s,  , ConFoot’s founder, was approached by a friend with a furniture import business. The friend had a small fleet of transport trucks continuously tied up waiting for customers to unload their furniture. He turned to Akela’s engineering skills for a solution. Akela quickly came up with the idea for container legs, but the challenge was finding the perfect balance of weight, cost and durability. The legs had to be light enough to be easily carried by one person, not cost a fortune and have a long lifespan. “Everybody liked the idea, but the product development took over a decade. It included consulting several engineers and the  , and numerous prototypes,” Seppänen says. “Our legs are a unique product so building up the market takes time. But I believe in five years we will be a household name,” says Sami Seppänen. A key issue was material. After several trials and errors, ConFoot developed its own blend of six Finnish steels for the legs. The result was a foldable design which weighs only 24 kilos but (as a set of four) can support loads of up to 30 000 kilos. The container legs were finally released commercially in 2013. Today, ConFoot counts multiple retail, transport and manufacturing companies among its customers. These include Ikea and the Finnish Defence Forces. By definition, ConFoot has targeted international markets from day one. The company has built a reseller network spanning 26 countries across Europe and is looking to add more countries in the near future. For a small company based in Espoo, Finland, local partners are crucial. “Success in this sector requires country-specific knowledge,” Seppänen says. “Local resellers already have the networks and contacts. They know how things are done in their market.” ConFoot is also interested in the markets outside Europe, notably the US, but there are still a few bumps on the road. For example, European trucks use air-suspension (which ConFoot’s legs require), but steel suspension is still the norm across the pond. Yet Seppänen is optimistic. “Steel suspension is a method of the past and at some point, they will move to air suspension,” he explains. “Then that market will open up for us.” In the meantime, ConFoot has its hands full building up its brand across Europe. “I read an article in the   which stated the key to great success is finding simple things before they become simple. Our container legs are exactly this kind of thing,” Seppänen concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/protectpipe-goes-with-the-eco-friendly-flow/,ProtectPipe goes with the eco-friendly flow,"This Finnish company offers a unique biological solution that removes organic waste in pipes, significantly increasing their lifespan. “Plumbing renovation” – just hearing the words can strike fear into the heart of any homeowner. Being notoriously expensive and painstaking, remodelling the pipe system is something most of us would rather not think about, inevitable as it may eventually be. ProtectPipe’s foreign exports have almost quadrupled in two years.  aims to help postpone that day as far as possible: the company’s products help sewage pipes last longer, extending their lifespan potentially by decades. The solution lies in not letting organic waste build up in drainpipes. Left untouched, organic waste starts producing toxic gases such as sulphuric acid, a highly corrosive gas that erodes pipes. Designed for preventive care, ProtectPipe’s microbial solution uses bacteria to remove organic waste, thus helping pipes operate better – and pushing back the need for repairs. As the microbes turn organic waste into harmless water and carbon dioxide, the product is an ecological alternative to other drain cleaners currently on the market The two-year-old company has already witnessed strong demand for its offering: ProtectPipe’s turnover grew by 150 per cent last year from the year before, reaching 1.2 million euros. During the same period, its foreign exports almost quadrupled. To illustrate the impact of preventive care on pipes,  , the company’s director of administration and finance, draws an analogy with brushing teeth – a practice that only really took off in the 1960s. Your plumbing can be a ticking time-bomb, and without proper care you have no idea when it’s going to go off. “Little by little people came to understand that if they remove organic remains by brushing their teeth, it prevents cavities and bad breath,” Keränen says. “We should think of plumbing the same way. Instead of preventive care, currently we just let pipes get increasingly brittle until they have to be replaced entirely.” Behind ProtectPipe’s creation was a simple question. Moving to a new apartment,  , the company’s founder and head of R&D, learnt that his new home had over 100-year-old plumbing. Wondering how the building’s pipes had been much more durable than the average, Alfthan started looking into the topic. Once he discovered that microbes have a key role in industrial water treatment, he set out to explore if the same principle could work also for maintaining drainpipes, which lead to the development of ProtectPipe’s solution. In addition to guaranteeing a long life to pipes, the company’s products help reduce the environmental load of wastewater and prevent toxic substances from entering the environment. This helps in the fight against eutrophication, or the excessive build-up of nutrients in the sea that leads to rapid growth of algae – a major threat to the Baltic Sea. ProtectPipe initially targeted primarily restaurants but has since expanded to shipping companies. For further growth, the firm is now especially looking at housing co-operatives, where it sees massive untapped potential. Hannu Keränen (left) and Klas Alfthan. Building upon its success in the Finnish market, the company recently started online sales to Sweden, and its products are already available through retailers in other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Estonia and Norway. During the next year, it plans to take its foreign sales to the next level by expanding to all countries around the Baltic Sea. “Our general philosophy is that being ecologically friendly is crucial, but it alone is not enough. Our products also have to be financially advantageous for the customers,” Keränen says. “Your plumbing can be a ticking time-bomb, and without proper care you have no idea when it’s going to go off.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-agricultural-innovations/,Five for Friday: Agricultural innovations,"This Finnish quintet has developed different ways to ensure agriculture is at the forefront of technology advancements. Historically, Finns have lived off the land. It’s fitting then that they have created a range of innovations that tackle a variety of earthbound challenges in the modern age. Much has changed since 2015, when  . This   spin-off was first known as Haytech, taking its name from its innovative wireless IoT system for monitoring fermentation levels in hay bales, an abundance of which damages quality and creates spontaneous combustion risks. Fast forward, and these days the solution is also used for monitoring grain stores and optimising the recycling process of residues into compost. The company also made headlines earlier this year for closing a 1.5 million-euro funding round. “We want to accelerate our product development also to other fermented materials such as grain, compost and woodcut, and aim at an ever-expanding international market,”   founder and managing director  . This company has developed technology that wirelessly transmits environmental data from deep below ground. Levels of moisture, temperature and salinity are reported in real time, from as deep as four metres below the surface. This provides vast savings in water and energy usage, thus guaranteeing demand for Soil Scout’s device in future. “Between now and 2050, the world is going to need a 300 per cent increase in the amount of water to service the needs of the next two billion in population,” the company’s then CEO  . “What motivates us is the excitement to make a tangible change.” Air, light, nutrients and water are the typical ingredients for growing happy vegetables. Soon, living moss could be part of the mix, thanks to a new sustainable and resource-saving growing media developed in Finland. Novarbo’s Mosswool slab provides an efficient and sustainable substrate for various vegetables. The slabs are made of sphagnum moss, are fully recyclable by composting and need less frequent watering than today’s commonly used growing media. “We already have a long queue of customers wanting to try the product,” technology expert  . With its handheld device, this Finnish company makes it easy for farmers to measure the quality of their grain for the first time ever, allowing them to make better decisions about their produce. The firm is now concentrating on the Finnish, Swedish and the Baltic markets, with plans to expand soon to other European countries. Operating internationally was self-evident from the start: “This is a world-class device, and our ambition is to make it available to farmers around the world,” CEO    . Before    , it took on the challenge of global food security through a novel climate project called Carbon To Soil. The idea was that anyone can support a transition to regenerative farming using the project’s mobile app. Users can select any amount of land they wish from one of the project’s farms. The land will then be transformed through regenerative farming. “Thanks to comprehensive scientific research we know that the most effective solution to world hunger and climate change can be found in regenerative farming in which the used agricultural methods result in nutrient-rich soil that can capture excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,”    ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/q-yachts-electrifies-the-boating-community/,Q-Yachts electrifies the boating community,"Finland’s Q-Yachts has made a global splash with its all-electric day cruiser, the Q30.  has set sail to become something that certainly has a nice, positively grandiose ring to it: the Tesla of the seas. The Finnish company recently launched what it believes could be a market-defining product – a fully electric day cruiser that promises to combine the peaceful and relaxing experience of sailing with the ease and convenience of power-boating. Q-Yachts is behind the wheel of a boating revolution. The Q30 cruiser is equipped with an electric motor that boasts a continuous power output of 20kW and allows for a cruising speed of nine knots and maximum speed of 15 knots – without raising a ruckus or emitting the pungent odour of diesel. The standard, 30kWh-battery pack provides a range of 42 nautical miles at cruising speed and the optional, 60kWh-pack a range of 80 nautical miles. “We have a very unique product and concept: a boat that has a solid range, looks absolutely gorgeous, is capable of relatively high speeds and, maybe most importantly, is one of the quietest options on the market,” tells  , the sales director at Q-Yachts. “Another key factor is that the boat is very easy to own and use because you can charge it by plugging it into a regular wall outlet,” he adds. “Our slogan is drive by day, charge by night.” The Q30, he reminds, has not been designed for people eager to brave rough open-sea conditions but for people who enjoy sheltered waters. The boat’s design was started from scratch, from the motor up. The Q30 is quiet, comfortable and energy efficient due to its powertrain and hydro-dynamically optimised hull, both of which have been developed based on an idea conceived by  , the founder of Q-Yachts and Oceanvolt, a Finnish manufacturer of electric engines for boats. Kjellman, an avid sailor with a propensity for technical innovation, began developing an electric propulsion system for boats after becoming frustrated with the lack of alternatives to the diesel motors purring and sputtering at the sterns of boats. “Once he found a suitable solution, he approached power-boat manufacturers hoping to find a partner to manufacture electric boats. There was interest, but many manufacturers wanted to fit the engine into their existing boats,” says Hildén. “The laws of physics and the development of electrical engineering mean that that doesn’t work.” Kjellman ultimately established Q-Yachts in 2013 and began developing what would later be named the Q30 with  of Navia Design, a Helsinki-based design agency focusing exclusively on boats. “They started to design a boat from scratch based on the framework provided by the electric propulsion system, rather than the other way around by trying to shoehorn the electric motor into an existing hull,” tells Hildén. The boat offers a versatile deck formation. Q-Yachts completed the first cruiser toward the end of last autumn and, after a series of performance tests, concluded that it works as well – if not better – than expected. The Q30 hit the market last spring, making a splash worldwide. “It has been wonderful to see how our innovative concept and unbelievably beautiful boat have been received around the world,” says Hildén. “We’ve now sold the first boats, including one to Australia and one to Switzerland. Enquiries have come in from Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, from Europe and North America, as well as from Ecuador.” The interest is evidence of enormous market potential. Hildén predicts that the technology and charging infrastructure will improve over the next decade to the extent that virtually all day cruisers will be electric and allow for day-long trips and, even, planing. “We’re dead certain that this will grow at least as quickly as [electric] cars,” he declares. “There currently isn’t anyone who’s competing with our concept. But in a few years someone will surely figure out that this is the smart way forward. That’s why we’re in a hurry to enter the markets and gain as strong a market position as possible, so that we have an edge when others wake up,” adds Hildén. Rapper Jare Tiihonen (right), also known as Cheek, and ex-professional poker player Jens Kyllönen are two high-profile owners of a Q30."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/minifiddlers-brings-violin-to-wider-audience/,Minifiddlers brings violin to wider audience,"International Minifiddlers, a programme launched by Helsinki-based Caprice, could make violin teaching a reality in primary schools and after-school clubs.  Parents around the globe are increasingly concerned about the effects of modern-day mobile gadgets on the learning and cognitive development of their children. “This is a concern for many parents,” states  , a professional violinist and the founder and chief executive of  . “The brain isn’t developing broadly enough and children may develop attention issues.” Rajamäki states that musical education is a means to combat the ill effects of spending virtually every spare moment fiddling with or glancing at screens no bigger than a couple of inches. Violin, for example,   to have a positive impact on cognitive skills, school performance and, later, the ability to cope in working life. “Violin requires perseverance and promotes both creativity and emotional faculties while offering an excellent way to counterbalance the incessant flow of information in today’s mobile-oriented world,” she explains. Caprice has sought to ensure as many children as possible have access to high-quality violin instruction since 2012, when it began developing a comprehensive online materials package for instructors interested in adopting what it believes is the most child-friendly violin instruction method available, the  . “We previously focused more on master-class level instruction, but now we’re also offering basic instruction, for which there haven’t been too many solutions – particularly ones based on distance learning,” tells Rajamäki. Distance learning is a means to ensuring virtually everyone has access to musical education. The 120 lessons were shot during a four-year pilot project with a group of Finnish children instructed by  , the developer of Colourstrings. As the same children participated throughout the process, the lesson videos also provide a one-of-a-kind window into how violin students make progress. “This is the first time in the history of music that something like this has been done. The material is exceptional also from that viewpoint,” highlights Rajamäki. Weekly distance learning sessions were simultaneously organised with children and violin instructors from a total of 12 countries, she adds. “The groups moved forward simultaneously, and we documented the progress they made – week by week, starting from the basics.” The programme is marketed under the brand  . It is targeted not only at violin instructors but also at parents eager to help their children to learn the instrument and at schools and after-school clubs. “It’s helpful especially for parents who have no musical experience. They often regret the fact that they can’t help their child learn the violin, even though they’d like to,” says Rajamäki. Colourstrings is based on the philosophy of  and tested and refined over four decades in Finland. The musicians who have practised with the method include  , one of the most renowned violin virtuosos in the world today, and  , the chief conductor of both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. According to Rajamäki, the method is ingenious in how it divides violin technique and music theory into distinct elements and introduces them to learners in the optimal order, in a way that makes use of colours and images. “The method and materials have brought us much closer to being able to bring violin instruction to primary schools and after-school clubs, to reaching as wide an audience as possible,” she says. Caprice, she adds, is eager to also contribute to the cultural exports of Finland. The company has already received investments from a fair number of small investors and stirred up considerable interest in China and Spain, for example. “We’re looking to raise funds to expand our customer base, support our concept development and create a new digital distribution platform – and thereby pursue robust growth,” states Rajamäki. Caprice is a true pioneer in the field of musical distance teaching, having developed distance learning solutions in co-operation with renowned violinist Pinchas Zukerman since 1997."

Depression, burnout, divorce, addiction and unemployment. Scrolling through today’s headlines and the weight of these modern-age ailments can feel overwhelming. In fact, one could be forgiven for throwing up their hands and simply tuning out. Not  . Some 18 months ago, he read in a newspaper that children often have to wait for up to six months to see a speech therapist. How could it take so long? He was spurred into action. Numerous phone calls to dozens of therapists later, Kivin found that the waiting lists can be much more than just six months, potentially years. Therapy provision is extremely time- and location-sensitive, and therapists simply cannot be everywhere at once. “I describe it as a bridge between the professional and their client,” Kivin explains. Alongside having an empathetic streak, Kivin was also an engineer, and he set to work harnessing the two to come up with a solution. “I figured that we have the tools to provide health and to do things much easier,” Kivin recalls. “We don’t have to live in the dinosaur age any more.” The end result was  : a highly secure video communication tool between professionals and their clients. Back on the phone to the same therapists, their response to his idea was extremely positive. This was in part due to a restrictive clause in EU doctrine. “In Europe, we are not allowed to use platforms like Skype or Google Hangouts in healthcare and social services. It’s forbidden for situations where we exchange medical information or info where people can’t be identified,” Kivin states. Kivin knew that merely coming up with the software wouldn’t be enough. He had to prove that customers could easily receive the treatment they need without them visiting a clinic or the therapist travelling to a customer. “The software is super easy to use. You simply register and launch a one-on-one conversation, or a webinar for thousands of people,” he states. Thus, the ‘1000 Helped’ campaign was born. Kivin hired professionals from around Finland to conduct online seminars on society’s most pressing ailments using his software. The ‘1000’ in the name indicated how many people could simultaneously participate in each seminar using Solki.live. Needless to say, the campaign was a huge success. “It proved that we can actually provide services, such as healthcare and social services, without depending on time or location.” Having proved that the software works at home, Kivin began looking to start a test pilot in the US. “I’m lucky to have a mentor living in Dallas, who is the head of the IT department for a hospital with 250 000 employees. He’s helping me to reach out to potential users.” Kivin has commenced negotiations with doctors and speech therapists, hoping to meet the needs of public-sector providers that lack these kinds of tools. You simply register and launch a one-on-one conversation, or a webinar for thousands of people. “There has been considerable interest in the platform, as they don’t want to use Skype for their medical purposes,” he explains. “Patient security is one thing I emphasise, as we also don’t store their data and people can join anonymously.” Given the restless creativity of many startup entrepreneurs, it’s common that they have many irons in the fire. Kivin is no different. He is also working on a mobile app that taps into e-commerce. “It’s a size guide app that takes your body’s measurements. We are co-operating with an e-commerce site that can then recommend the right-sized clothing for you.” But for now, he insists, Solki.live is the best fit for his attention. “My clients appreciate that the service works completely in-browser, and can collect payments and record everything and also host other videos.” Kivin points out that many of Solki.live’s functionalities are not present in the competition. “I’m very excited, let’s see how it goes. I’m also happy to offer the software to whomever wants to try it out,” he says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/neckpacker-gives-travellers-a-break/,Neckpacker gives travellers a break,"The journey of Finnish company Neckpacker has been long and winding – but that’s okay, since this is exactly what it wants to prepare its customers for, too.  isn’t trying to hide it: it’s running late. Initially, the company told the backers of its crowdfunding campaign that they’d get their products sometime around November 2017. “It does look like we made a mistake with the number on our Kickstarter page,” admits founder and CEO  . “We’ve had more setbacks than one startup would need, really.” However, now its backers are finally bound to get their money’s worth: the first deliveries will be dispatched very soon, and the online store will be launched in November. The recipients will get their hands on a Neckpacker: a coat custom-made for travelling with different kinds of pockets, an inflatable travel pillow and a hood that brings some privacy to nap times. The idea for the product was born, perhaps unsurprisingly, in 2013 during a long car journey from Lapland to Southern Finland. Kuusela struggled to find a comfortable sleeping position and began pondering over different kinds of solutions to the problem millions of people face every single day. Niklas Kuusela (right, pictured with co-founder Mikko Nisula) thinks the product beats traditional travel pillows on a lot of levels. “Suddenly I didn’t feel that sleepy at all. Instead, I just developed the idea further and further.” Once Kuusela had introduced the idea to his friend, the duo started putting more effort into it. With the prototype they managed to create, Kuusela even went to meet some officials and experts – but the result wasn’t always encouraging. “At one of the meetings, I was literally laughed at and told this would be a waste of my time as well as theirs,” he recalls. Some people were a little more supportive, but the company still had trouble finding someone who’d take it seriously. Fortunately, Kuusela was determined that this is a product that the world is in need of, and disbelievers only made him work harder. In 2016, the doubters had to swallow their pride. A company called Baubax had developed a jacket similar to Neckpacker, and its crowdfunding campaign brought home over 11 million US dollars. “We were told that they should’ve listened to us then, because that would’ve made us the first. That’s when we started receiving money for product development, and we started our own crowdfunding campaign, too.” The campaign attracted over 700 backers, and Kuusela is confident that many more will be keen to get their own coat. He points out that somewhere in the world, there’s a plane taking off every second, day and night, making the potential customer base immense – and counting cars, trains and buses, it grows even more. Not everyone believed in Neckpacker – but its owners refused to give up. However, convincing people wasn’t the only bump on Neckpacker’s road. The partners it initially chose to manufacture the inflatable pillow and the coat itself turned out to be slow and unreliable. “Some things took forever, and we were kept waiting for months on end,” Kuusela says. “One manufacturer provided us with unacceptable quality. We had to start looking elsewhere, as we couldn’t just let things grind to a halt.” Now, Kuusela is content with the Chinese partners Neckpacker has found, and things seem to be running smoothly after a rough patch. He notes that although it’s sad that the crowdfunding backers didn’t get the coat on time, the team is much happier with the product they have now than they were a year ago. If the crowdfunders are eager to get their items, so are some retailers and importers around the world. Kuusela tells that a few companies in the US and Japan are interested in collaborations. The founder doesn’t think that every single air traveller will eventually wear a Neckpacker. To him, even a share of the huge market would be a great reward after the years-long battle. He has got no doubt that, every day, many people feel exactly like he did in the car coming down from Lapland. “We all know how useless regular inflatable pillows are. With Neckpacker, travellers can adjust the pillow in countless ways, so everyone will find a cosy position. Sleeping well bites off a good chunk of a long journey.”"

Once the VR goggles have been donned, the youngsters ‘learn by doing’ as they seemingly bike about in a real city. “The response from kids has been they much prefer this to studying from a book,”  , with no small understatement. “The experience combines a real environment with guidance. The kids can safely try out different scenarios and receive instant feedback.” The stylish augmented reality glasses of sci-fi films are still far removed from the bulky eyewear of today, but this startup might just have the technology to bring the future a little closer. It has developed a see-through display technology which brings high-resolution visual information directly into the user’s field of vision. These full-colour displays can be easily integrated into any lens design and turn even ordinary eyewear into immersive AR glasses. “Our displays bring another world, a virtual image layer, on top of the real world,”  . “This can be used for instructions, information and entertainment.” This company is leading an upward trajectory with its so-called   series. Here, players find themselves in a tense, zero-gravity space environment, accompanied by a soundtrack composed by   of defunct Finnish love metal band HIM.   was released last month. Founded by industry veterans from Remedy, Bugbear, Moon Studios, RedLynx and Unity, the studio has set out to shake up the world of VR gaming. “We want to make big waves in the VR industry, so concentrating on just one of these things would not be enough,”  . “This company was founded because all of us are super excited about VR. We saw so much untapped potential that there was no other option than to quit our safe jobs and found 3rd Eye Studios.” Despite the comical tone of its press releases, Immersal’s product is serious business. The company develops AR experiences for large spaces, such as shopping centres and other retail venues. A customer can look for shops, restaurants, products and additional product information, as well as tempting offers or collectable points inside a shopping complex, using his or her own mobile device and Immersal’s app. All this spells improved shopping experiences and, hence, opportunities for boosting revenue – and saving money. “Ads and real-time offers can hang in midair, and the app acts like a clerk, explaining where things are and giving more information about products,”  . “A customer looking for tinfoil can find it in two seconds instead of having to get lost and frustrated in a hypermarket. Who knew it’d be in the paper product section?”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/himmee-lets-there-be-light-in-style/,Himmee lets there be light in style,"Finnish light designer and manufacturer Himmee holds dear all things Nordic: its products are simple yet classy, contemporary yet ageless. Himmee’s internationalisation is boosted by the recently launched language versions of its webshop.  was very, very fed up. It was around 2013, and for a few years he had been spending plenty of time, money and effort travelling around the world, introducing his light designs to various manufacturers. Many of them were interested and collaborations were on the cards, but nothing seemed to be actually leading anywhere. He started to ponder over the option of just doing it himself instead. “I figured that that way I wouldn’t need to compromise on anything,” he recalls, “and also, my designs wouldn’t just be collecting dust as prototypes on some company chief’s table.” Whilst working as a woodwork teacher in a local school, Niskanen continued developing his range of lights on the side. He set himself a deadline: by interior, design and furniture fair  ’s opening date in 2014, he would have to have enough ideas and products to launch his collection. “The development continued for about one-and-a-half years,” Niskanen tells. “I see Habitare 2014 as the moment my company was born.” The company, known as  , has since become a regular visitor to not only Habitare, but also to a lot of other events across the globe. These days, Niskanen travels on his own terms. Niskanen and his business partner and wife,  , regularly visit design and interior architecture events around Europe and sometimes beyond. Himmee has some resellers here and there in Europe, and its webshop ships all over the world. “For a designer, lights are interesting instruments to work with,” Niskanen says To some extent, Himmee’s internationalisation is hindered by country-specific electricity regulations. For example, in the US and Japan the regulations differ from those in Europe, meaning that Himmee would need to manufacture products targeted specifically at those markets. However, Niskanen believes that Himmee appeals to audiences pretty much anywhere in the world – at least judging by how popular Nordic and Scandinavian design has grown in the past years. “The clean-cut, democratic, classy and easy-to-approach style seems to be really popular,” he notes. “In today’s world, the manufacturing process is a big part of the product, too, and customers expect sustainable and transparent supply chains. All of our production happens as near as possible and most of our subcontractors are Finnish, and we aim to be as fair as possible in all respects.” For the coming years, Himmee’s goal is to open the door to the European market properly. This year, the online store was opened in French and German, and new resellers are being sought, as are other partners for collaborations. Himmee has worked with many interior designers, and its products have been ordered for entire hotels. Himmee Unplugged reminds people to switch off modern conveniences every now and then. It’s no accident that Niskanen ended up working with light. He’s fascinated by the double job that lights and lamps have: not only do they need to serve their purpose as a source of light when they’re switched on, they also need to look stylish when they’re off. “For a designer, lights are interesting instruments to work with,” he notes. “They are not only functional objects but also pieces of design, and they have a huge impact on the atmosphere.” Speaking of atmosphere, Himmee has also created an unplugged version. Its candle holder, Himmee Unplugged, carries the typical Himmee style and is meant to remind people that sometimes it’s good to switch off completely. “Fire can be a soothing element,” Niskanen says. “At least I enjoy calming down in the evening just with the light of a candle.” Being Finnish, Niskanen thinks, is one of the reasons he has grown fond of light, as the country offers such extremes of it. Although Himmee’s business booms when the sun is down, the entrepreneur’s personal favourite time of year isn’t mid-winter. “I really enjoy spring, when winter begins to fade and we get longer, lighter days.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-exercise/,Five for Friday: Exercise,"Finnish expertise in exercise harnesses new technology and some good old-fashioned training to get people up and moving in a variety of ways. Whether it’s working out at work, exercising while gaming, training mums’ mind and body, or just taking the stairs or to the ice, these Finnish companies have got it covered. All work and no play makes for dull living. Therefore, this app uses videos to guide office workers to exercise and stretch a couple of minutes during the workday. The results are palpable. “Just like companies want to provide their employees with tools and practices that increase efficiency and make working easier, they ought to look after the wellbeing and motivation of their employees as human beings,”  . Combining mobile gaming, activity tracking and real-world exercise possibilities, Fitness Village aims to be the world’s largest virtual fitness centre with 100 million users. There’s one crucial difference: the exercise is optional. “At some point [while playing], you realise that if you put your sneakers on and leave home you can find power-ups and other boosters for your character, making the game faster and easier for you,”  . Once outside, the app further consolidates its real-world benefits by being able to synch with a range of sports tracking devices and fitness equipment. “There’s no other such application in the world that combines these technologies.” Post-pregnancy issues in women’s bodies aren’t publicly discussed far and wide. This ‘mama’ offers different kinds of training courses to mothers recovering from childbirth, providing accurate information to ensure no harm is done. The service is not restricted to exercise classes either, with the courses run by professionals taking a holistic approach to wellbeing. The icing on the cake: the service is also an online community. “There are so many topics new mothers talk about with their peers,”   of Nordic Fit Mama. “Receiving fact-based guidance from trustworthy sources will make the phase much smoother. Having a baby is about as life-changing as things get.” Synchronised skating is a disciplined sport that works for the good of both mind and body. Now, Finnish expertise on ice is travelling to Chinese schools, thanks to this company. With the Beijing Winter Olympics looming in 2022, there have been whispers of adding synchronised skating to the games’ programme. If everything goes to plan, the performers and their coaches will be trained by two-time world champion   and other Finnish experts. “Synchronised skating is great due to its diversity,”  . “It requires physical strength and coordination, good balance, sense of rhythm and stamina. It’s also a team sport, as you can’t do it alone and have to be considerate of others all the time.” Why take the elevator, when you can climb stairs into space! By using motivational tools, this app wants to make the world a better place, one stair at a time. “Choosing the stairs instead of the elevator is the easiest thing that you can do for your health,”  . “While the health benefits of exercise, in general, are nothing new, renewed attention is being paid to the effect that exercise during the workday has on an individual’s output.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/saint-vacant-s-shoes-bring-a-smile-to-your-face/,Saint Vacant’s shoes bring a smile to your face,"This Helsinki, Finland-based boutique shoemaker is looking to bring together the best of two worlds: the comfort of bespoke shoes and the flair of street footwear. found his professional calling quite literally at his feet. Shoes. The 43-year-old cobbler says he had a desire to design and create objects for everyday use throughout his previous career in music and cultural management, having grown up in a family where his parents and grandparents worked with their hands – one as a blacksmith, another as a leather worker. “Shoes just somehow jumped at me,” he tells. “Then I found a bespoke shoe shop in Helsinki – and that was it. It’s a great way to combine creativity and working with your hands.” Lax developed his craft there under the tutelage of two experienced cobblers before launching his own shoe brand,  , in 2005. The idea, he says, was to incorporate the comfort and quality of bespoke shoes into small-batch manufacturing and create a new kind of crossover between classic aesthetics and street fashion. The same idea is represented in the name of the company. “The word ‘saint’ is a nod to tradition, especially to the fine shoemaking tradition in Great Britain. Whereas the word ‘vacant’ is a nod to the feeling you have when wearing the shoes: no matter how long a walk or work meeting you’ve had, you’ll feel like you’re on a vacation. That’s our goal,” explains Lax. Saint Vacant’s Goodyear-welted shoes feature both classic and playful elements. Saint Vacant began as a relatively ordinary fashion brand, growing its product catalogue regularly, launching several collections a year and pursuing growth in sales through online channels. But something about it did not sit well with Lax. “I noticed that we were working a lot, producing waste, making shoe moulds and prototypes, and sending materials back and forth,” he tells. “But did it make any sense?” He decided to focus on what he excelled in – men’s shoes with both classic and playful elements – and pare down his product line dramatically, ending up with five models that all cater to a specific purpose and target group. “I launched a major makeover, restarted the brand at the end of 2016. I went through the entire operation and, at least personally, I’ve been pleased that the amount of waste the business creates has decreased. I also looked very carefully at what materials we’re using for what, and if anything can be reused.” Lax currently designs the lasts, moulds and blueprints in Kruununhaka, Helsinki. The Goodyear-welted shoes are produced at small factories in Portugal, with the materials being sourced from all around Europe – mainly from Italy, Portugal and the UK, as well as from France and Germany. But how exactly does one make what are ultimately factory-produced shoes feel special? Innovative design, replies Lax. The lasts, he tells, are slightly more well formed over the instep and under the sole than what consumers have come to expect from regular factory-produced shoes, thus offering more comfort. “What I also brought over from bespoke shoes is the asymmetrical shape of the opening: the outer opening has been carved deeper where the malleolus is, while the inner opening has been raised to offer more support,” he adds. “They’re kind of small things, but they make a big difference in practice.” Sustainability is another factor that is taken into consideration throughout the design and manufacturing process. Lax states that while his first priority is to ensure the shoes fit well and are comfortable to use, he also pays careful attention to details such the materials, stitching and outsole to ensure the shoes can be repaired if they happen to break. “We want to make sure you don’t ever have to throw them away and buy a new pair,” he says. “Of course we also instruct our customers how to take care of their shoes. It’s ultimately the end user who decides how much the shoes will wear out in use.” Saint Vacant has recently launched an effort to increase its headcount and expand to international markets, supported by early-stage funding from  . “It’s a big project for us,” admits Lax. “Our focus in the first stage will be on on Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Norway, Sweden and maybe also Denmark will be in our plans in the second stage.” He assures, however, that he is not intent on building a shoe empire, but rather on pursuing smart growth by continuing to put quality first. “Our biggest challenge is to get people to try on our shoes, because often it’s easy to tell that they can feel the difference on their feet – as it shows on their face,” states Lax. Saint Vacant’s product line consist of five essential models: slippers, lace-up boots, dress shoes, casual shoes and Chelsea boots. The only five a gentleman needs."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kindergartens-can-focus-on-play-with-kindiedays/,Kindergartens can focus on play with Kindiedays,"After first setting out to make pens and papers redundant, this company now seeks to spread Finnish education expertise across the globe. Where’s my pen? Oh, it’s raining, the paper’s getting wet! Hang on, is this GDPR-compliant? Keeping track of a group of small children is a full-time job, particularly with all the administrative work that comes with it.   co-founders   and   are fully familiar with the pain points of the profession, having worked together in the management of a Finnish playschool. The app wants to help others make use of Finland’s top-notch expertise in education. “We felt that a lot of the ways in which information was recorded were unprofessional, old-fashioned and not very secure,” Mikkola explains. “We could also tell that our playschool wasn’t the only one struggling with the same issues.” On top of making sure everything important is written down accurately and in a timely manner, the Kindiedays duo wanted to make communication between parents and teachers smoother and more efficient. For example, checking the child’s absences or finding information about upcoming events would be much easier using an app instead of a growing pile of paper notes. “Often parents are in a rush both when they drop their children off and when they pick them up, so there’s no time to really talk about how their children are doing,” Laidler explains. Children aren’t always able to help, either. Mikkola and Laidler have noticed that when parents ask their child about the day, the child often doesn’t elaborate on what he or she has been up to. Thus, parents don’t always stay up to date when it comes to the educational aspect of daycare. If a teacher has documented the day’s learning on the app, the parent can use it to create more depth in the conversation and continue learning at home, the founders add. The idea started to brew when Laidler and Mikkola were working as colleagues. In 2016, they quit their day jobs to fully focus on developing Kindiedays. Outsourcing the code with support from angel investors and then-Tekes (now  ), the two education professionals took care of design and content. The idea for Kindiedays stemmed from Jessi Laidler (left) and Milla Mikkola’s personal experiences at work. The first version of the product hit the market in 2017. Currently, it’s available in Finland, Spain and Dubai, with ongoing pilots in Colombia and Australia. The core idea is three-fold. Kindiedays helps plan and document a child’s learning, making it visible to both parents and teachers. Secondly, it helps teachers and parents communicate in a more meaningful way. And thirdly, it supports teachers in their daily routines, beginning with things as simple as noting the length of a child’s nap. “The idea was born out of point number three, but now we’re putting more and more effort into the pedagogical elements,” Mikkola tells. “We don’t restrict our international clients to the Finnish curriculum, but through our app they can understand why Finnish early-childhood education is so well known.” Currently, Kindiedays is available in four languages: Finnish, English, Swedish and Spanish. The team is searching for more partners abroad, primarily within the existing language regions. Laidler points out that selling a service like Kindiedays is very different in different markets. The ways in which parents and teachers think vary between countries, so the app isn’t customised to just suit the Finnish context. In many places, the emphasis is still on how the tool helps teachers in compulsory reporting. “For example, in Spain teachers need to report children’s lunches and toileting with a pen and paper. With the app, it’s faster and easier,” Laidler says. However, the underlying vision Kindiedays has is to share Finnish education secrets and make it possible for others to utilise bits and pieces of them. Things that are taken for granted in Finland might be new approaches elsewhere. “It’s really important to have all three parties involved, from children to parents and teachers,” Laidler concludes. “Otherwise a playschool is just a parking space for kids.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-discovering-finland-at-the-china-international-import-expo/,Five for Friday: China International Import Expo,"China is hosting its first International Import Expo (CIIE) this week in Shanghai. Finnish expertise has been on hand, making its presence known in the region. Altogether, the CIIE has attracted more than 3 500 companies from over 170 countries, with many of the countries themselves presenting eye-catching country pavilions. Finland’s country pavilion evokes Aurora Borealis, clean air, clean lakes and Finnish wood – not forgetting Santa Claus, who this time made a virtual appearance through an AR app produced by   and  . The Finnish companies at the pavilion showcase some of the best in Finnish innovation and knowhow. Focused on dentistry, this Finnish healthtech company has been in China since the 1980s. It has opened a new office in Shanghai, and is looking to expand and invest in the Chinese market. At the expo, it has demonstrated its small, lightweight and fast Planmeca Emerald intraoral scanner and Planmeca Creo C5 chair-side 3D printer. “We came to the CIIE to promote our digital future concept for all-in-one software which will connect the monitoring of our products through one platform,” says the company’s digital marketing advisor  , who is developing Planmeca’s digital marketing strategies in China to build further contacts with potential distributors and customers through social media. This company is dedicated to ion emission air purification system R&D, design and manufacturing. Aavi has its R&D centre in Finland and its sales and operation centre in China. Aavi’s unique selling point in China is that its air purification products do not use a filter but rather ion technology to purify the air – whether at home, office or industrial site – of nano-scale particles such as bacteria, viruses, ultra-fine particles and industrial dust. “Aavi’s household products are already popular in China, thanks to their efficiency, and the fact that they are self-cleaning, can be connected to fresh air systems and are easy to operate and maintain,” explains senior marketing manager  . “This year, our focus has been on expanding our reach in industries. We currently have five installations in the steel industry and are looking to grow in this huge market.” Attracting a lot of attention, not only from visitors to the expo, but also in the Chinese media, this forest-based bioindustry giant brought its Biofore concept car to the Finland pavilion. The concept car’s shell uses biocomposite made of cellulose fibre and plastics, and its interior is made from thermoformable wood materials. The car runs on low-emission biodiesel and was designed and produced in collaboration with   and  . “We have been saying among our colleagues that at least half of the Chinese population must have now seen our Biofore car through the media,” enthuses senior environmental specialist  . The company is celebrating its 20th anniversary in China this year. Its operations in China include paper, packaging and label materials, accounting for 15 per cent of the company’s global sales. “We wanted to come to the CIIE to showcase what our company is doing to mitigate climate change as well as show our long commitment to the Chinese market,” Wang continues. This company’s representatives from the   have been on site at the CIIE Finland pavilion to present their collaboration in intelligent air quality monitoring together with  ,   and China Mobile. “We are using a multidisciplinary approach to build up 5G real-time air quality monitoring in megacities such as Beijing,” explains  , business developer for the University of Helsinki’s business collaboration unit. “The goal is to use this technology to more accurately pinpoint the source of pollution. An end result could be an app allowing people to monitor the air quality of specific, smaller areas of the city, allowing people to make an informed decision for instance on where they would like to live.” Having been in the Chinese market for 10 years, Tikkurila is the leading paint brand in the premium segment with 600 stores in 200 cities. , who runs Tikkurila’s industrial business in China, explained at their client event at the Finland pavilion that Tikkurila is now looking to expand into industrial paints and coatings in China. Tikkurila used the opportunity presented by the CIIE to launch new products for the Chinese market. These were namely a new isocyanate-free polysiloxane topcoat with specific use for agriculture, construction and earth-moving machinery and equipment, and both interior and exterior steel structures; and a high-solids epoxy primer used in the processing industry, exterior surfaces of storage tanks and reservoirs, and railway vehicles."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/maptionnaire-wants-everyone-aboard-on-urban-planning/,Maptionnaire wants everyone on board with urban planning,"With its map-based online questionnaires, this Finnish company offers urban planners an easy and efficient way to collect views from local residents. Cities are constantly evolving, but their residents often feel they have little control over how their living environments change. Maptionnaire has set out to change this. The service’s map-based questionnaires make it easy for urban planners to reach out to residents in order to collect their views about their surroundings. This allows the planners to collect large datasets that offer insights about the areas and can inform the planning processes. Maptionnaire is making a difference, from New York to Stockholm. The service has users around the world. For example, New York City’s Department of Transportation consulted residents with   when creating a new transit plan for the city last year. “In the past, the planners only collected this data by interviewing people in the subway and buses, so our tool was a helpful addition,” says  , CEO of Mapita, the company behind  . Over in Sweden,   to present its plans for a new residential area in Värtahamnen, the district where the dock for Silja Line ferries arriving from Finland is located. For urban planning, Maptionnaire’s service offers some clear advantages over other survey tools. As it is map-based, respondents can clearly indicate the locations they want to highlight. The service also makes it easy to reach a lot of people. “When the City of Helsinki ran a survey, over 3 300 respondents participated over one month,” Kahila says. “Big datasets like this are a really useful tool for urban development, but it used to be extremely difficult to get data as detailed as this.” Maptionnaire also makes it easier to involve residents in the early stages of a development project, giving them the chance to voice their opinion even before plans are finalised. “If residents aren’t given the opportunity to contribute, they are more likely to react negatively when final plans are revealed,” Kahila says. As the service is map-based, respondents can clearly indicate the locations they want to highlight. Kahila stresses that the company wants to enable more constructive exchanges between urban planners and citizens. “Right now, some planners can even be apprehensive about interacting with residents. Sadly, they’ve learned to expect negative feedback.” Maptionnaire’s origins go back to  , where Kahila previously worked on research projects that developed new ways to collect residents’ views about their living environments. After receiving positive feedback for their work, the researchers decided to spin off the project, and in 2011 they launched Mapita. While most tech start-ups focus on scale, the company decided early on that its attention should first and foremost be on the clients. “It’s crucial for us that we listen to our customers and develop the service based on their needs, rather than obsessing over growth,” Kahila says. A large part of Maptionnaire’s users are already outside Finland, and in the future the company hopes to reach a growing number of international customers. Encouragingly, its clients’ needs seem to be very similar around the world: “It has been fascinating to find out that, for example in Canada, urban planners face very similar issues to what we’ve seen in Finland.” Technology can provide new solutions, but perhaps the biggest challenge for the company is linked to mindsets. New tools are not always immediately embraced. “During our early days, many people didn’t really take us seriously,” Kahila says. “But in just a few years we’ve seen that attitudes have changed, and more and more people are realising how useful this is.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nopia-ride-gives-a-lift-to-clean-electric-journeys/,Nopia Ride gives a lift to clean electric journeys,"Urbanisation takes more and more of us into growing megacities, where mobility poses an ever-increasing issue. Nopia Ride wants to help people go to places without adding to smog and pollution. In the fresh air of Finland, even in its biggest cities, it can be difficult to relate to the air pollution issues that growing metropolises around the world are facing. However,   founder and CEO   found himself constantly pondering over topics such as clean energy and transport, alongside urbanisation and traffic congestion. Nopia Ride is similar to Uber, but all cars are electric. “In many megacities, traffic jams and air pollution are real issues,” Suojanen says. “Although Finland might not struggle with them on the same level, air pollution doesn’t stop at borders. Solving these global problems benefits everyone.” EkoRent offers electric car rental and ride sharing services in Finnish cities, enabling people to get on the move without owning a car or using petrol. The concept has caught on: after being launched in 2014, it has been awarded a Climate Solver Company prize by WWF, and named the Best Company in Consumer Cleantech at the Cleantech Venture Days. Suojanen wanted to take the idea of affordable electric mobility international and began eyeing East Africa, particularly Kenya and its capital Nairobi. “People tend to say that if you want to do business in East Africa, you should start in Nairobi. If the idea flies there, its neighbouring cities and countries will want a piece, too.” Earlier this year, EkoRent’s subsidiary EkoRent Africa began piloting a service known as   in Nairobi. There’s no car rental element; instead, Nopia Ride is similar to the world-famous ride hailing service Uber, but all cars are electric. As much as possible of the electricity is produced from renewable and eco-friendly sources, according to Suojanen. Suojanen sees the service as a perfect fit for a city like Nairobi. For example, for many taxi drivers the high price of petrol means that their profit margins are near zero. The running costs of electric cars make Nopia Ride an appealing alternative for many drivers, leading to more affordable prices to consumers as well. Juha Suojanen is the father of both EkoRent and Nopia Ride. Some say that electric cars aren’t necessarily by default eco-friendly, as a lot depends on where their energy comes from. This works in Kenya’s favour, too; Suojanen points out that the country gets plenty of sun, so solar panels are abundant, and has also worked hard to make us of geothermal energy. “In fact, Kenya has already implemented more renewable energy than for example Finland,” he tells. The network of charging stations is also growing quickly. Suojanen tells that when doubters tell him that the lack of stations in Nairobi would hinder Nopia Ride’s expansion, he responds with two photographs. “One of them shows Fifth Avenue in New York City crowded with horses and carriages and only one combustion engine car in 1900. The other shows the same road 13 years later full of cars and without a single horse. Changes like this can happen really fast, and in recent times new technologies have been adopted faster and faster.” Initially, the biggest challenge to Nopia Ride was to convince investors. Suojanen says he’s lucky to have found a few courageous ones besides Team Finland, but, in general, not many Finnish investors seem to understand the immense opportunities that lie in the rapidly developing and digitalising African cities. “Of course, investing in Africa looks riskier than doing the same in Stockholm, but the potential is also tenfold.” Now, the goal of the pilot in Nairobi is to show everyone that Nopia Ride doesn’t only work in Suojanen’s presentations, but in real everyday life. First, the company aims to grow in one city, and then take it further. Currently the drivers are employed by Nopia Ride, but in the future they will be working, again, similarly to Uber. Nopia Ride will function as a platform and offer a network of charging stations. “Our slogan is that we go places with clear conscience,” Suojanen explains. “Inhaling the polluted air isn’t great, so our cars do their bit to make cities more liveable.” The working title for Nopia Ride was Uber-Eco, as there are various similarities between the two."

This Finnish startup launched a free phone wallpaper generator that blew up on Reddit and successfully boosted the profile of its main business stream: customised map posters. Users type in any city in the world on its website, select their style and order a custom-made poster. “We’ve gotten really good feedback,” co-founder  . “People choose locations where they got married, where they were born, where they met their first love or something like this. Every product has a story behind it.” Every day is a Sunday for this company bringing cheer to homes and offices with bright colours and shapes made of ecological materials. Its fun approach continues to open doors to a sustainable future. “We always try to get creative and think outside the box when it comes to new materials,” co-founder  . “Of course, not buying anything at all is the most ecological choice, but when it comes to decorating a home our decals are a much better choice than PVC plastic or paint.” These wallpaper designs feature the contributions of graffiti artists, surf-wear designers, illustrators, fine artists, tattooists, typographers and fashion designers. Walls worldwide are given a creative boost, thanks to the founders’ finesse in digital business, marketing and production techniques. “We’re three ex-advertising people who had had enough of selling ideas to make children eat chocolate cereal,” co-founder    . “So, we jumped from our day jobs to focus on the things we actually care about: art, big ideas, design, craft, having our socks knocked-off and originality.” Although cameras and photographs are everywhere these days, fewer and fewer photographs end up being printed. Plywood Print wants to make the ones that are extra special. “Create your own wall art from your own pictures is the principle we sell to customers,”    . “Printing on plywood adds character to the photograph, with the wood grains and colours making the image livelier and adding to the depth.” Naava’s living green walls are a biological air purifier, humidifier and space divider all rolled into one. “In the modern world, we spend 90 per cent of our time indoors, where we breathe man-made, synthetic air and are often disconnected from nature,” CEO    . “We at Naava are reconnecting humanity with nature, by embracing millions of years of natural innovation with latest technologies and modern design.”"

And its origins come not from the cutting edge, but from the distant past. Plasthill has a mission. This Finnish family-run company manufactures distinctive   round cups, plates and bowls built upon centuries-old Karelian tradition. But its audience couldn’t be more different, and it is an audience which is growing. Kupilka is a modern take on the wood-carved cups used by Kari Kuisma’s ancestors as far back as 1775. “Our products are targeted towards the typical modern person who cares about nature, wants to take care of themselves and spends time outdoors,” says  , international business manager at Plasthill. Today the Kupilka range is sold in close to 30 countries around the world. Aside from their design, the appeal of Kupilka products is that they are durable, lightweight and recyclable. This is thanks to their construction from a proprietary natural fibre composite made out of wood-based fibres and thermoplastics. This ensures the cups and bowls can withstand boiling water but also hold their own in temperatures as low as -30C. Ecologically, all Kupilka products can be safely burnt, recycled or returned to Plasthill for re-use at the end of their life cycle. While this may sound futuristic, Kupilka’s roots are anything but. Kupilka’s origin lies in 243-year-old Karelian ingenuity. Situated in the east of Finland, old Karelia was the homeland of Kupilka creator  ’s ancestors. And it was those ancestors who first carved Kupilka’s distinct round shape out of wood back in 1775. “Kuisma saw the need for a modern alternative since wood isn’t the best material for everything,” explains Kaasinen. “The development of a new material started and the cup’s design was updated to combine modern usability with respect for old traditions.” The material, called Kareline natural fibre composite, was a collaborative effort between Kuisma, company partners and Puugia, the Centre for Wood Technology in North Karelia. The first Kupilka cup was introduced in 2003 and today Kareline is used across the product range. In 2017, the Kupilka cup was awarded the Scandinavian Outdoor Award for its quality, functionality and design. Plasthill initially produced the biomaterial for Kuisma but eventually bought his one-man operation in 2014. Now Kuisma is in charge of the company’s domestic sales team. Kupilka’s green credentials appealed to Plasthill. In 1998, Plasthill became the first company in Finland to use green electricity throughout its production process and today claims to have made its entire manufacturing process emission-free. “We don’t waste anything, even heat,” emphasises Kaasinen. “All waste heat is recycled back into production and any waste materials or faulty products are re-used.” Plasthill’s ambition for Kupilka is to make it a global outdoor brand. Kupilka dishware has already gained a strong foothold in the Nordics, Canada, Germany, Japan and the US. Next Plasthill is targeting Australia and China. With the active outdoor lifestyle increasing in popularity around the globe, the company’s international efforts are well timed. “It definitely has an impact,” enthuses Kaasinen. “Our exports grew over 80 per cent last year and already account for nearly half of our sales.” But sales are not all that matter to Plasthill. While the company would like to see everyone buy a Kupilka, the company has a different priority. “Our material development is ongoing and we are making the plastic element more environmentally-friendly,” Kaasinen explains. “Ecological values are everything to us.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/round-zero-levels-playing-field-for-mobile-games/,Round Zero levels playing field for mobile games,"This Finnish mobile game publisher has come up with a data-driven, revolutionary way not to let the personal preferences of its staff influence which games it decides to publish. Equal opportunity is a core value for  . The Finnish mobile game publisher has set out to provide every game developer with equal opportunity to capture the often fleeting attention of mobile gamers by effectively outsourcing decisions on which games to publish to a community of gamers, thus eliminating the personal biases of its staff from the decision-making process. “We have no gatekeepers making decisions,” tells  , the co-founder and chief executive officer of Round Zero. “Every game developer will get the same opportunity regardless of how good or bad their game is in our opinion.” “No one alone can predict whether a particular game will be a success or not.” The decisions are made by the tens of millions of active users of  , a massively popular mobile game series developed by  , the Oulu-based parent company of Round Zero. The driving games have racked up hundreds of millions of downloads since the first of the series was released in 2012. Fingersoft was surprised, but not overwhelmed, by the success, according to Rantala. The game studio quickly began to contemplate how to best make use of its large and growing customer base, ultimately deciding to establish a publishing division. “But the challenge was that demand from game developers was simply enormous. [Fingersoft] didn’t have the manpower and the process would’ve been subjective,” he says. “You don’t step into the ring until people start playing your game,” says Daniel Rantala. Round Zero was founded to tackle both problems in October 2017. The seven-person startup has since soft launched three of the roughly 170 games it has evaluated and expects to record a turnover of approximately 1.1 million euros in its maiden fiscal year. Rantala reminds that soft launch is only the first in a series of steps that game developers must take if they intend to stand out from the roughly 1 500 games added daily to the shelves of App Store and Google Play. “You don’t step into the ring until people start playing your game,” he says, casting light on the boxing metaphor behind the publisher’s name. “It’s no longer enough to create a good game. No matter how good it is, you’ll need resources to push on with marketing, develop the game further and promote user retention. Many don’t have the knowhow, skills or cash coffers to commercialise a promising game for the next five years.” The evaluation process is multistage. Round Zero first provides the game developer with 500–1 500 live users and monitors how the game performs across a variety of metrics including ad conversion, session data and user retention. If the game shows promise, it is then sent back to the developer for updates before being launched for an additional 2–4 000 users. “Even if a game doesn’t perform well in the first stage, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad but simply that it isn’t the right fit for our portfolio,” reminds Rantala. No one alone can predict whether a particular game will be a success or not. “If the game continues to do well, we’ll move on to soft launch,” he adds. “That’s when we make a revenue share agreement with the developer. We handle marketing and user acquisition, and take on all the risk.” Regardless of the outcome, the process offers benefits for both the developer and publisher – the former gaining free users and access to valuable performance data and analyses, and the latter an opportunity to expand and diversify its portfolio. “The feedback has been exclusively positive,” says Rantala. “Most have indicated they want to test their games through our service also in the future.” Round Zero, he tells, has set itself the objective of releasing 5–10 games during the course of next year, including one that could be characterised as a foray into a new game genre, a departure from the petrol-fumed world of  . “One of the challenges we’ve had is that we’re still largely at the mercy of our user base and have to turn down games that could be successful,” he tells. The publisher is also gearing up to launch its new development and monetary efficiency optimisation tool after a 17-month development project. The DOME tool is expected to create a plethora of new opportunities to interpret, utilise and enhance the accuracy of the performance data, as well as help to scale up the evaluation process at least tenfold. “DOME is a unique system, built exclusively for our own needs,” tells Rantala. “Its business intelligence feature will make financial management easier, while its analytics feature will enable us to interpret the data with our own key performance indicators. Let’s say someone takes a break from a game to read and reply to an e-mail. Some analytics tools would interpret that as one and others as two sessions.” “It may not sound terribly important, but it’ll be the difference maker,” he affirms. Round Zero’s previous releases, including physics-based tank game Hills of Steel, have surpassed 16 million downloads."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-bags/,Five for Friday: Bags,"These five Finnish companies are making sure that customers are getting carried away with their different approach to making bags. Finnish innovation has got it in the bag when it comes to style and durability. The Kasperi crew is keeping a close eye on maintaining a high quality with its leather bags. The company uses not only Scandinavian bull and cow leather but also yak leather sourced from Mongolia and tanned in Finland. The changing nature of the source material encourages customers to form a long relationship with their bags. “Consumption cycles are getting very short, especially in fashion and consumer electronics,”    . “But, if we give a consumer a product that they really like and they notice that it is only getting more personal and better with time, we can communicate the value of investing in more lasting stuff.” MoiMoi mixes Finnish fondness for clean lines and practicality with Spanish leather crafting skills to create bags that only get better with time. “People abroad like the fact we come from Finland and Helsinki; they associate them with good quality and design,” founder  . “We want to combine the best sides from both countries. The simple, practical style from Finland and the Spanish leather handicraft expertise.” The company’s goal with its best-known products – leather bags – is to manufacture ecologically sustainable products and keep production nearby. The bags may be produced locally, but they appeal to consumers worldwide, with South Korea and Japan particularly fruitful markets for Lumi. “Japan is interested in top-of-the-line Finnish products and, generally speaking, our product type is suitable for their market,” co-founder  . After specialising in camera and mobile phone bags and making its products available in over 120 countries, the zeitgeist dictated it was time for Golla to shift focus in 2012. Cameras disappeared and all mobile phones smartened up. Now, Golla designs minimalistic, Scandinavian-style bags. At department stores, its products have been moved from electronics to fashion and accessories departments. “A lot has changed indeed,”    . “But the idea has remained the same: designing consumer products with a distinctive twist and pushing them abroad furiously.” Indeed, the company has   with the Japanese trading house Itochu Corporation and put its products on shelves in  . And now for something different: this Finnish startup aims to substitute plastic bags with a new material based on wood fibre with plastic properties. It mainly consists of wood fibre but isn’t like paper. It is lighter, more durable and even stretches. “The business idea of Paptic was originally established as a response to the banning of plastic bags in numerous countries,” CEO    . “We wanted to provide an alternative to plastics: the wood-based, recyclable and reusable Paptic material.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/fitness-village-gets-gamers-moving/,Fitness Village gets gamers moving,"This Finnish mobile game hopes to encourage people to follow in the same footsteps as Pokémon Go. Players first develop their own avatar character by playing dozens of different games modes, which vary from puzzles to reaction-based challenges. Equal parts nervous and excited,   sat inside the esteemed BAFTA 195 Piccadilly in London. The Mobile Games Awards 2018 were underway, having attracted the world’s top talents for a ceremony that underlined their achievements across a range of categories. There was one significant reason why the COO of Finnish startup   stood out from the crowd that included reps from industry behemoths Apple and Google: his company didn’t have anything on the market. Yet, it was nominated as one of the most technologically innovative companies. “The organisers discovered that we had figured out ways to combine existing technologies and features and put them into one single application,” Kääriäinen recalls. An underdog going up against the heavyweights – the stage was set for a fairy-tale ending for the fledgling startup. Instead, it got one with a healthy dose of Finnish down-to-earth reality. “Unfortunately, Apple took the prize,” Kääriäinen says with a wry laugh. Regardless of the result, the world had sat up and started paying attention to this five-person startup from Finland. Fast-forward six months and the company has unleashed its first title onto the market. Inspired by the skyrocketing AR success of  ,   encourages youngsters to be active whilst playing mobile games. “It’s a real problem for parents these days that their kids are sitting in front of screens, motionless. You can see that some youngsters aren’t in very good physical shape as a result of this. Therefore, we wanted to create an environment to give tools for them to play and have fun,” Kääriäinen states. “The idea of moving comes from the player itself, not from pushing them. We make it optional,” states COO Klaus Kääriäinen. While   was explicit in its goal of getting people up and moving,   offers real-world exercising possibilities with one crucial difference: it is optional. If desired, players can remain on the couch tackling dozens of puzzles and reaction-based challenges by themselves or against players worldwide. However, by switching to GO mode, they open up a world map of their current physical location. A range of location-based missions, such as treasure hunts, sprints and distance challenges, then offer carrots to get them in motion. “At some point, you realise that if you put your sneakers on and leave home you can find power-ups and other boosters for your character, making the game faster and easier for you.” Once outside, the app further consolidates its real-world benefits by being able to synch with a range of sports tracking devices and fitness equipment. “It’s pioneering stuff,” Kääriäinen states. “There’s no other such application in the world that combines these technologies.” Fitness Village’s target group is aged 14 to 35, though the concept also has proven appeal for people outside this age bracket. Fitness Village’s roots can be traced back to one man: . The company’s founder has over 20 years of experience in the fitness field and is also the founder of Finland’s most successful training centre concept,  . Over the years, he has worked closely in the field on product innovation, training methods and patenting. Herranen set out to explore ways to use mobile gaming as a way to bring people closer to fitness after observing its detrimental effects first hand. The company was founded in 2013 and has since caught the eye of private investors from a range of fields. A funding boost from   helped spur development further, and a   was another early milestone. After two years of rigorous development, the game is picking up the pace on the market. Positive reviews and strong word of mouth are cheering it on. Now it’s really time to break a sweat, to see how far the company can run with it, right? Well, kind of. “The next stage is to create a lot of products in this field, as there’s interesting market potential,” Kääriäinen outlines. “Certainly, we will update the game, but we will also start creating new applications to encourage people to move. “We already have the concepts ready for our next product.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-habitare/,Five for Friday: Habitare,"Finnish design innovation takes centre stage at this year’s Habitare. Design fever swept over Helsinki once again this week when Finland’s largest furniture, design and interior decoration event returned to highlight today’s most attractive trends. “Finns are spending much time at home, which is a safe haven but increasingly also a work place, and   therefore covers home and living from many angles,” said the event’s creative director, , at the opening ceremony. Finnfacts brought a group of international journalists to the scene. Here is just some of what was discovered. This year, the trend exhibition aims to challenge visitors’ senses with not only visually appealing elements but also, for example, sounds and smells. The four themes are the Renaissance, glamour, dream world, and bare and pure, and they all reflect broader social phenomena and megatrends in design, interior decoration and housing. In all of the rooms, brave, personal and colourful styles and visuals are highlighted and the creators challenge the visitors to ponder questions such as “why not?” and “what makes you happy?” In the Renaissance room, for example, the creators have highlighted the changing perception of life’s possibilities. “There is a new era coming up now when people are innovative like during the Renaissance,” says  , curator and trend analyst. “For a long time, the norm has been to choose a profession for life, but today the mindset is about multipotentialites, not being afraid to change directions or do many different things at the same time.” The Block area is internationally the most diverse showcase of young contemporary Finnish design and designers. New talent is presented on a large scale with young designers, startups and design schools showcasing their work. For example, the Protoshop area, organised by Imu and Habitare, is a platform that gives designers at the beginning of their career the chance to present their ideas to manufacturers and to the public. “The aim of Protoshop is not only to help designers get their prototype commercialised into a product, but it is also much about helping them get out their name,” says  , curator at Imu Design. One of the prototypes is “MOOD” (Lampclock), designed by industrial design student  . By changing its tone according to the time of day, her clock is an answer to the constant presence of screens and their blue light confusing our natural circadian rhythms, causing insomnia and other health problems. “The idea came to me when reading about infrared yoga and its good effects, and I then developed an idea of how this could be applied in the home environment,” says Laamanen. Another one is PIILO, created by    , who wants to design objects that surprise the user. The stool can, for example, be used as an entryway seat or bedside table. Simultaneously, small objects can be stored and hidden away inside it. “I wanted to create a functional product for small city homes as people usually don’t have that much space,” Lantto says. A new theme for Habitare this year is the startup area, which brings out fascinating new and up-and-coming design companies to present their fresh collections. One of these is  , which offers exclusive home computing experiences. The company’s founder,  , is experienced with computers and has wanted to combine this interest with design for a long time. The result is a table with a built-in water-cooled computer with all the components visible making the hours spent in front of the computer more visually appealing. The prototype won two categories at the   Summer 2018, making Husky Bongs the first Finnish company to win a prize in this international competition. According to Bäckman, the startup’s main market is abroad, but it does not necessarily have to be in the computer industry. In December, the company will launch its first commercial product, a lamp. “Our main mission is to create products that are of high quality and are durable,” Bäckman says. In the kids’ area, a giant pink pillow takes over the floor and everywhere people of all ages are seen climbing, playing and relaxing on the soft play area. This is artist and graphic designer  ’s answer to creating a space were children and their parents can be equally involved in the play. “Here you see that children don’t need to run around to get stimuli but their imagination is stimulated when they themselves can come up with what to do. This is a space that both parents and children enjoy,” says Rewell. Rewell points out that there is a lack of playgrounds where children and adults can interact, and it is common that the adult ends up only watching the children from a corner. The enormous caterpillar is engaging in a whole new way that lets children themselves come up with ways of utilising the play area, triggering and satisfying their creative steam. The theme of the year is roots and it highlights the growing appreciation of the origins of things and different cultures as a reaction to globalisation. This year, the annual international friend of Habitare was  , the curatorial director at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. During her speech, she talked about culture and roots and their impact on design today, illustrating her points with a collection from the Cooper Hewitt museum. “I am impressed with the Habitare offering and in particular the use of wood,” McCarty   in a release. “I have seen more wood during the past few days than I have perhaps during the whole year. The products show a strong relationship with nature; the whole palette is natural, which is the greatest strength of Finnish design.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/smartblock-brings-squares-of-peace-to-the-buzz/,Smartblock brings squares of peace to the buzz,"Smartblock’s made-in-Finland mobile meeting pods squeeze calm and quiet places into the smallest of offices, saving expensive square metres and everyone’s nerves. Today’s office people tend to be always on the move, and globalisation ensures that they’ve always got something to say to colleagues near and far. However, quite often they need to open their mouths or conference calls when someone else needs some quiet time, and just as often vice versa. This is a market that   taps into: mobile quietness and mobile sound. The company’s smart and mobile meeting pods are designed to meet the needs of those who seek privacy in public spaces, such as offices, airports, libraries and co-working spaces. Kristian Sällström has been the CEO of Smartblock since last summer. “We want to bring smart solutions to meetings, wherever they occur,” says CEO  . “There is a large variety of places where people need to either escape the noise or be able to make noise without disturbing others.” Smartblock’s pods come in two sizes, for two or four people. The selection includes both closed and open options with and without integrated audiovisual technology. The pods are perfect collaboration spaces that can be further enriched with added equipment, like interactive or traditional whiteboards, while audiovisual technology enables, for example, video conferences and Skype calls. All pods are mobile, so they are easy to move from one corner to another. This is one of the things that distinguishes Smartblock from many of its competitors. “With wheels at the bottom, it’s easy to adjust the position of the pod to suit the purpose of each meeting,” Sällström notes. Smartblock was founded in 2015, and Sällström joined the team last year. First, he dealt with operational functions, but in the summer he jumped into the CEO’s shoes. Now, the company has a team of seven, with extra salespeople being hired. Started by   and  , Smartblock received a hefty investment from Sontek Ventures in 2016. Another funding round is underway, aiming to accelerate the firm’s growth. Currently, the company has a strong foothold in the Finnish market, with resellers and partners across the country. Things are looking bright in the neighbouring countries as well; there’s a reseller in Denmark, and Sweden and Norway are showing signs of growth. All pods are mobile, so they are easy to move from one corner to another. The next big step awaits in Germany, where, Sällström tells, Smartblock has visited fairs to plant the seed for sales and increase the brand’s visibility. Another interesting destination is North America, namely the US, where the company landed an acknowledgement in the workplace technologies category at the annual commercial design industry fair NeoCon in Chicago. “The US is definitely an interesting market for us, and we’re increasingly seeing results stateside, partially thanks to the prize,” Sällström says. Sällström believes that the mobile lifestyle is a sign of the times. “In the ‘90s, people in offices were fenced out and they all had their private tables,” he explains. “Now, mobile offices are much more common, and that has brought about the issues with noise and lack of privacy.” Thus, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the biggest customer segment for Smartblock is offices. The solution’s advantage is that as meeting rooms tend to be designed for bigger groups of people, the pod enables a gathering of a smaller crowd without taking up as much space. That, as Sällström points out, is a money issue. In a lot of growing megacities, square metres are a significant expense, and increasingly so. “A meeting pod is 3.5 square metres in size, so it’s possible to fit it into a small office space,” he says. “This is also why we don’t target countries as such in our marketing efforts, but instead focus on cities and regions where space is costly and offices abundant.” Although Smartblock isn’t the only player in the field, including in Finland, Sällström believes that all companies have their own strengths. If anything, having multiple firms operating in the same market shows that there’s demand. “Who wins will be the one with the best product for the best price,” he says. “What works for our benefit, too, is that all of our pods are made in Finland, including everything we buy from subcontractors.” A stamp of quality, that is. All Smartblock pods are made in Finland from start to finish."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/language-learning-is-child-s-play-with-playvation/,Language learning is child’s play with Playvation,"This Espoo-based provider of digital language learning solutions allows your children to learn a foreign language with the help of the Moomins. The method has been designed specifically for three- to seven-year-old children – the optimal age for foreign language learning. Research on the value of foreign language skills is practically unavoidable these days. Foreign language skills have been shown to promote creativity, improve memory and broaden career horizons, but they are crucial first and foremost for ensuring that children become a part of the rapidly globalising world, reminds  , the CEO at  . Children in many parts of the world, however, are at a considerable disadvantage because they have no access to daycare centres offering foreign language instruction, let alone foreign language immersion programmes. Even in Finland, such daycares are notoriously difficult to gain admission to because of their immense popularity. Guttorm believes digitalisation can be harnessed to level the playing field. Playvation, she tells, is a spin-off from Promentor Solutions, one of the pioneers of digital language learning in Finland. Playvation was founded three years ago almost to the day on the belief that digital technologies will revolutionise language learning and the realisation that most of the available digital solutions are not rooted in pedagogy. “We looked at all the products on the market. They were all shoddy, with no pedagogical content. There were professional products for adults. And then there were consumer products for children aged three and over, but they consisted mainly of narrow vocabulary exercises,” says Guttorm. “We, on the other hand, have been developing a research-based learning method that’s an efficient way to acquire a second language.” The method has been designed specifically for three- to seven-year-old children – the optimal age for foreign language learning – and consists of an application, a three- to four-year curriculum and a narrative that develops as the children make progress. The immersive learning takes place in short, 5–15-minute sessions to promote efficiency and accommodate for the short attention span of children. “You learn the language just as you did your mother tongue: through play,” summarises Guttorm. “We have weekly themes that align with the development goals of the Finnish early childhood education curriculum. We deal with emotions, develop social skills and foster creativity,” she states. “Hardly anyone offers as much continuity as we do or introduces new structures of the language and expands them constantly. That definitely gives us a competitive edge.” The solution has already been adopted by two of the leading daycare centre chains in Finland, Norlandia and Touhula. It is also in use in a growing number of municipalities and is set for its launch abroad in the near future – initially in Japan and Turkey, and later in China. You learn the language just as you did your mother tongue: through play. “We’ve signed our first distribution agreements in Japan and Turkey, and we’re currently preparing for China,” tells Guttorm. She points out that while the learning application allows children to build up their vocabulary, develop their grammar and hone their pronunciation independently, the fact that it is used in a daycare setting ensures children have an opportunity to use the language with their peers as part of teacher-organised activities, such as play, sing and handicrafts sessions. “This combines independent daily learning with social group learning. The teachers don’t necessarily need to have language skills themselves,” she views. Playvation has recruited some of the most recognisable characters in the world to support its expansion into new markets and, thus, the language learning of children – the Moomins. “We’ve been granted an exclusive global right to use the characters in the area of language learning. The co-operation started after we pitched our business plan to them. Of course, it helped that we started out as a family business, have a 30-year history and are pioneers in the field in Finland,” recounts Guttorm. “We’re committed to building this into a successful business in the long term.” The Moomins, she adds, are excellent partners especially because they are widely associated with a high quality and represent the same values as the Finnish early-childhood education system. “The Moomins have a supporting role in the service: the characters promote learning and join children on their journeys. The Moomins’ values include courageousness, equality and appreciation of nature. These are the kinds of values that are needed today around the globe,” Guttorm says. Although Moomin Language School certainly has the potential, Guttorm is under no illusion that the market will be easy to crack. “We’re on our way, but we have to make haste.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-sky-s-the-limit-indoors-for-light-cognitive/,Sky’s the limit indoors for Light Cognitive,"Winter is coming and shorter, darker days (and moods) with it. But instead of giving up to the dark, Finnish company Light Cognitive has developed an indoor lighting system that closely mimics the natural day-night cycle. Light not only affects our mood but also our wellbeing and productivity. Our energy levels rise together with the sun, and the warm light hues in the evening signal our brains to rest. But following these natural light cues can be difficult – not least in the Nordics, where summer days are long and bright and winters the complete opposite. Light Cognitive’s newest launch is an artificial skylight which creates the feeling of a window without the need to cut through a roof. “I had lived over 20 years abroad. When I came back to Finland, the first winter was awful. People got tired and irritable, whereas in the summer they were full of energy,” recalls  , founder of  . “I started to think about what could be a solution that would help people [feel better] but also be attractive from an architectural and design point of view.” To find the answer, he turned to the sky. Instead of trying to simply recreate sunlight like many other companies, Light Cognitive developed a lighting system that brings the natural pattern of daylight hours indoors. Called Big Sky, the system mimics how the sky changes through the day from sunrise to sunset. Behind Big Sky is plenty of physics and even more research. Light Cognitive has developed proprietary physics models and uses light spectral modelling and thousands of different types of LEDs to create its daylight effect. Salomaa likens it to looking into the horizon through a window. “Our product is a vast light field that simulates the light of the sky. It is not a display, there are no pixels, it’s a continuous light field,” he explains. “From a physics perspective, we have aimed to create light spectra similar to the horizon and colour transitions that are similar to those in nature. They happen in the right order and with the right intensity.” The first Big Sky products were launched in 2016. Today the system is available as large wall and ceiling fixtures, custom-made installations and the company’s newest innovation: an artificial skylight. No matter the shape or size, all these products can be set to automatically follow a personalised daily sunrise-sunset cycle or changed to different light scenes using a mobile app. “We researched what affects people’s wellbeing and is aesthetically enjoyable. We chose the light and the colours of the sky. A lot of companies work with sunlight but no-one looks at the sun, they look at the sky,” says Sami Salomaa. Light Cognitive has already expanded beyond Finland. Big Sky installations can be found in London, Paris and Geneva workspaces, the hospitality industry, private homes and even in schools. But it is the Big Sky Skylight which is now driving the company’s most significant expansion plans. “In London and other [major European] cities space is at a premium and high prices are driving extensions downwards. With the Skylight, you can turn a basement into a penthouse or bring window-like light to any windowless space,” Salomaa enthuses. In addition, Light Cognitive’s eight-strong team is focused on product development, including bringing down the price of its lighting systems by developing proprietary electronic components. Currently, prices start at a few thousand euros. “I like that our products can be used to make ambitious showcase installations, but I also want to make products that are easier to produce in high numbers and available for a larger group of people,” Salomaa concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-slush-singapore/,Five for Friday: Slush Singapore,"The third edition of Slush Singapore brought the buzz to the Lion City. Following on the heels of   the week before, this year’s   saw a curious crowd coming out to listen to a variety of speakers cover topics from future transport solutions to blockchain – and, of course, to merely bask in the buzz. Here’s some of what caught our eye. According to Hyperloop CEO , transport as we know it is set to change with capacity being limited and traffic going from bad to worse.  : moving people on the ground at aviation speeds. Hyperloop uses electromagnetic propulsion and a levitated capsule which transports over 160 000 people daily at a not-at-all-shabby speed of 1 200 km/h. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi film, perhaps, but it is what future transport will look like – no more long commutes and traffic jams. A production plant has been announced in Brazil, so let’s see where Hyperloop takes us. Slush is all about entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on startups. A Philips-sponsored pitching competition narrowed the focus to health. Little wonder, with Singapore’s rapidly ageing population of 5.5 million – the same as Finland’s. Interesting pitches from FluidAI (boosting hospital visits), Third Opinion (AI-assistant for diagnostic image analyses) and NuriBio (personalised health, biopsy) were three that made an impact on stage. One strong takeaway from the event was that technology allows the use of all kinds of reality (AR, VR, XR, or immersive technologies) to tackle all kinds of problems: health, visualisation, music, you name it. In fact, it was almost an exception if a company’s offering did not include an AR component. Soon to be everywhere, in everything! Keeping with the virtual theme, one of the highlights was the Helsinki stand bringing together eight Finnish AR, VR and travel technology companies. As opposed to a more traditional exhibition space, one of these,  , created a virtual stand where visitors could experience each of the companies’ offerings. In addition to this, the   of Finnish companies were present, including  ,   (also Slush Singapore’s official travel app),  ,  ,  ,   and  . Finnish entrepreneur and coding spokesperson   closed the event. Her message: Where do stories fit in coding? Through her   book series, Liukas is teaching kids around the world to code and prepare them for a world where many of the problems are computer-based. She has a brilliant way of dissecting the complexities of coding logic, or mainly how us ‘adults’ perceive coding as complex. According to Liukas, even the biggest problems are just “tiny problems stuck together”. Liukas also touches on artificial intelligence in her books, describing them simply as algorithms that use data to learn. She would want to see AI evolve further from its current use. AI should be used to support us. Liukas also spoke at the   conference in Singapore – a great messenger from Finland about education and especially in coding."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kidday-captures-entire-childhoods/,Kidday captures entire childhoods,"Traditional baby journals include photos and scribbled memories of a child’s growth, but they are difficult to share. Finnish company Muntius wants its service Kidday to become a digital home for childhood tales. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… Every day is a   for   co-founders   and  . However, they’re not the only ones who want to keep track of what their children are up to; grandparents, godparents, uncles, aunts and the rest are all keen to hear how the little ones are doing. Our slogan is that every moment with your child is priceless “Some wanted to get photos over Whatsapp, to some I had to email them and some wanted updates in text messages,” Nieminen explains. “It was a lot of work, and in the end the images drown in a sea of photos of whatever else has been sent.” Nieminen and Seifulla decided to tackle the challenge by creating a platform on which parents could share photos with the people they choose – family and friends – safely and conveniently at one go. Unlike general services, such as Facebook or Instagram, Kidday is customised for families with children. “On Kidday, families can record the child’s overall development from weight to shoe size and first words,” Nieminen tells. “It’s like a digital version of a baby journal that other family members can comment on to leave their mark in the child’s story.” The contents of the journal can also be printed and turned into a book, and photo prints and collages are easy to create. Kidday will also serve as a marketplace and a source of information for families. Kidday’s cloud service ensures that the photos won’t be lost even if devices break or if physical albums disappear. The free version of the service includes limited storage space, but if users go premium there’s not restriction as to how much can be stored. The owners of the account can choose who has access to the documents, and as the child grows up the content can be passed onto him or her as a gift. “Our slogan is that every moment with your child is priceless,” Nieminen notes. “That’s why Kidday’s aim is to enable families to store and share those moments with others, and eventually with the children themselves.” The company’s goal is nothing less than to become the number one digital baby journal in the world. However, this isn’t the only plan for Kiddays: on top of the product itself, Nieminen and Seifulla want to grow the site to become an online service platform and marketplace for families. “We’ve partnered with experts across various fields who produce information and materials for families,” Nieminen says. “I know from experience that as a new parent, there are all kinds of opinions out there and you never know who to trust. We want to provide reliable, science-based information.” In addition to offering expertise and support, Kidday is creating a marketplace for family products, giving companies an opportunity to target their advertising based on big data and artificial intelligence. Nieminen points out that this also helps families find the right products at the right time. The anonymous data Kidday collects will be enriched by artificial intelligence, creating yet another revenue stream for the company. Investors have been impressed: currently, Muntius has over 100 owners as well as an experienced team of advisors. The service is being piloted in Finland, and Nieminen says the team is carefully listening to customer feedback to ensure Kidday really delivers its promise of being the best of its kind. The first foreign market the company is stepping into will be the UK, from where Nieminen hopes to see Kidday spread to other English-speaking regions. The ultimate goals are China and the US, where the huge volume of potential users make the market particularly appealing to the company. There are ongoing negotiations with potential partners in both. Yet there’s plenty more where that came from. “We’ve validated a total of almost 50 countries where Kidday has significant potential,” he says. “After entering the big markets, we’re expecting the revenue stream to grow exponentially.” Kidday co-founders Juho Nieminen (left) and Shamil Seifulla used to send numerous photos of their kids to various Whatsapp groups – but no more."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/plywood-print-makes-memories-lively-and-lasting/,Plywood Print makes memories lively and lasting,"Although cameras and photographs are everywhere these days, fewer and fewer photographs end up being printed. Finnish company Plywood Print wants to make the ones that are extra special. We take photographs everywhere, all the time. Lunch plates, landscapes, details on the street, festival wristbands and our pets and babies are being pointed at with mobile phones and digital cameras more than ever. The abundance of photographs doesn’t decrease their value; they are still memories of our cherished moments. Finnish company   wants to make them super special by printing them on wood. “Create your own wall art from your own pictures is the principle we sell to customers,” explains  , the company’s marketing expert. “Printing on plywood adds character to the photograph, with the wood grains and colours making the image livelier and adding to the depth.” From left to right: Mirna Shampemba, Carl Meyer-Arnold, Nikolaos Kitsoukis (intern), Ricky Wan, Adam Rowe. Customers have fallen in love with the idea of having their memorable moments printed on either white or natural-coloured plywood, be it a poster-like 1-millimetre sheet or a thicker, 15-millimetre one. Plywood Print also offers wedding invitation cards, business cards and the like. Plywood Print is actually a part of Laser Cut Studio, a company operating in the same space near central Helsinki. Laser Cut Studio offers laser engraving and cutting services, working with all kinds of materials from leather and glass to acrylic and wood. The firm was founded by  , a furniture designer originally from London, the UK. The idea for Plywood Print followed swiftly, expanding the company’s portfolio. Initially, Plywood Print mainly served individual customers wanting to decorate their homes with their own photographs. Since then, businesses have jumped on the bandwagon, asking for their logos and other marketing materials to be printed on wood. The open road ahead. Social media is a useful tool for visual companies like Plywood Print. On top of the original idea, many clients also appreciate Plywood Print’s commitment to environmental values. Shampemba emphasises that all of the wood the company uses is sustainably sourced Finnish birch plywood with   and   certificates, and the UV stable inks are eco-friendly. “Being ecological is very important to us,” she says. “The end product is also very durable, and the photo will stay bright and shiny for years, so it’s not fast fashion.” Plywood Print also makes eco-conscious packaging and logistics choices by optimising its shipping, and it plans to enter into charitable collaborations with environmental organisations. Laser Cut Studio and Plywood Print are bossed by Rowe, who’s supported by a team of three: Shampemba in marketing, wood wizard  and production manager  . Shipments abroad are sent from the very place the products are made. Shampemba tells that a lot of orders come from Sweden, which is also the next place where Plywood Print will target its marketing efforts. “The Nordics are definitely our biggest market,” she says, “followed by France, the UK and Italy, and then elsewhere in Europe. Our five-year plan is to start marketing more aggressively and generate growth in Central and Southern Europe, too.” Shampemba believes that Plywood Print also appeals to fans of Nordic design and lifestyle. Thus, the company tends to highlight the Finnish origin of its products in its marketing. “The traditional, simple yet classy Nordic design is gaining international fans, and Helsinki and Finland are becoming more and more popular as tourist attractions,” she notes. “I’m sure a lot of our customers are the same people who appreciate Finland, its nature and all things related to Finnishness.”"

These innovative systems from Finland help to facilitate smoother business practises across a range of applications. After realising that integrating the different systems of companies needed to be made easier and more affordable, this company decided to specialise in making them work in harmony. And so, bid farewell to accounting software that doesn’t work with your logistics system, which in turn doesn’t match with your webstore. “The current generation of [our] platform allows us to customise the integrations and has opened the market for bigger customers with customised systems as well,”   co-founder  . “Now we can serve customers from small micro-companies to mid-sized enterprises.”  proved that this company was on to something with its business analytics dashboard. It’s plug-and-play cloud service turns numbers and metrics into visual, actionable data for project teams and their stakeholders. This means that they can easily track project progress and react to any potential issues. “Numbers alone don’t lead to change. You need to act based on the numbers and for that to happen, the information needs to be visible,” founder . “We dig up the information, calculate the metrics and can put it all also on big TV screens on the office walls for everybody to see.” This company is using digital collaboration and gamification to shift change management from consulting jargon to an engaging tool for organisational transformation. The end result, NOOA, is an online platform for change management. “If a small group makes a plan, presents it with a slideshow and then says, ‘let’s implement this’, others are not able to learn from it and commit to it,”   founder and CEO  . “People are more committed when they can come up with things to do themselves, instead of just being told what to do.” This Tampere-based team developed a digital team game – and then realised it could help everyone else create their own, too. The resultant ActionTrack is targeted at corporate events, education, destination services and marketing. “Gamification is a huge trend, and ActionTrack makes it available to everyone,” CEO  . “For example, teachers and education service providers can use it in teaching, resorts and hotels to develop activities for guests, and employees to make their workshops more engaging by turning them into a team game.” Invoicing, time tracking, project management – this is only the start of a long list of the business management systems used by companies. This cloud service promises to bring them all under one roof. “Companies want ease-of-use, agility and cost-efficiency,” the company’s  . “You can improve productivity and save time when you have a tool people actually like to use and where all different modules work together.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/chaos-architects-wants-cities-to-be-built-for-people/,CHAOS architects wants cities to be built for people,"By bringing big data and citizen engagement into the picture, CHAOS architects aims to disrupt urban planning practices – for the people, by the people. One single action can make a big difference. “It’s what the butterfly effect in chaos theory is all about,”   CEO   says. “That’s where our company name comes from, too.” Natalia Rincón believes that opening up city planning processes would benefit not only cities, but private organisations around the world that are used to dealing with manual reports. CHAOS architects wasn’t founded to raise havoc; if anything, it wants more order in the cities of today – and especially those of tomorrow. Rincón and the team have created a tool for public organisations, decision makers, consultancies and companies that helps look into the future and meet the needs of people, be they citizens, customers, patients or whatever else. Rincón herself is an architect, and she has also studied computer science. During her studies, she was involved in various urban planning projects. “I couldn’t help but think that as a member of the public, there should be much more straightforward ways for me to impact what’s going on in my surroundings,” she explains. Once, she sat down in a café to observe and film the way in which people take up space in public and utilise it, thinking about how modern technologies could enable people to take part in the planning of their environment. “In Finland, we have a participation process, but it’s really just a bureaucratic checklist with no engagement or true meaning,” Rincón notes. “What if we could make an impact with crowd insight and concentrate on big data, hard facts and real needs as fuel for decisions?” Enter CHAOS architects, a company doing just that. As soon as the idea was born, Rincón began to network with like-minded people in the urban planning scene. It turned out that a lot of them were doing something about increasing citizen engagement, but none of it was particularly systematic. The CHAOS architects team is now 10-strong, and is one of the most diverse startups in the Nordics. That’s what CHAOS architects is set to change. The company delivers insights based on any kind of data related to smart cities, be it traffic, sustainability or infrastructure. The data, collected through open APIs by governments, companies and partnerships, is then produced into dashboards and forecasts that can be used to create simulations. The questions CHAOS architects helps answer include the likes of where schools, sports centres, public libraries or bike lanes should be located. “The foundation lies in crowd insights and algorithms that use artificial intelligence to learn how liveable cities should look like and what strengths and weaknesses certain cities have,” Rincón explains. “That way, we enable dialogue between stakeholders and offer them good arguments.” Rincón emphasises that the software-as-a-service solution is meant to break down silos. “Everyone is dealing with data these days, but they work separately,” she tells. “Putting heterogeneous data together in the same format is an industry that’s growing. Our aim is to create more sustainable cities for everyone and a more collaborative way of building them.” The tool developed by CHAOS architects has been validated by a couple of hackathon wins, some   visits and investments. In June, the company was selected for the finals of the   organised by the European Commission. The tool is currently being tested in Finland, with plans to expand to Denmark, the Netherlands and Singapore, as well as New York City in the US. Rincón believes that as urbanisation is a global trend and cities are growing at an unprecedented rate, the complex situation can greatly benefit from insightful data. “Thus far, we’ve been planning our cities in a very archaic way, with old tools and bureaucratic processes. When the situation is much more complex and the infrastructure needs to adjust rapidly, we should disrupt the way we plan cities in order to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/liq-packs-culinary-expertise-into-a-black-bite-of-bold-flavours/,LIQ packs culinary expertise into a black bite of bold flavours,"Driven by personal passion, LIQ is on a mission to feed fellow liquorice-lovers around the world with its top chef version of a classic sweet treat. The Finnish premium liquorice serves every mood of the day and can even be used in cooking – have you ever-tried sea salt-infused liquorice in a red wine sauce? In August 2015,   and   sat down to ask one another where their real passion lies. As experienced entrepreneurs, the two friends had co-operated many times before on various management consulting and development projects, but now they sought a new direction for their common goals – one boosted by a personal favourite. “We came to the conclusion that there is no premium liquorice from Finland on the market,” says Nenonen. The duo drew on their decades of management experience to create a solid strategy. With exciting flavours and appealing visuals at its core,   was soon destined to spread across the Finnish border. “Liking liquorice is actually a matter of passion which can be satisfied by serving the customers new flavours and taste experiences,” says Nenonen. Knowing that the premium-label required something extra to tickle connoisseurs’ taste buds, one of the first things the liquorice friends did was to invite renowned Finnish chef   to join the team. After giving him complete creative freedom, the result was a set of surprising yet flavoursome combinations such as orange and black pepper, and raspberry and rosemary. Co-founder Jari Nenonen has many favourites but the coffee-flavoured LIQ Morning is his top choice. “As a chef, Tomi knows how to unite different tastes by combining sweet and sour or other seemingly contrary flavours that go well together and complete each other,” says Nenonen. “He insisted that we should only choose the best natural raw ingredients, and therefore no artificial flavours are used.” Today, LIQ is available in nine different flavours that all tell their own story. Together with marketing professionals  , a theme was created by letting the black delights symbolise the dark winters up north and adding different concepts of time with the infused tastes. For example, the salty caramel-flavoured LIQ Dusk merges the flavour of toffee with the last sunlight of the day: As a result, the flavours also serve different moods of the day. While the sea salt-infused LIQ Moon is best paired with a glass of red wine in front of the TV in the evening, the first latte of the day is complemented by the coffee-flavoured LIQ Morning. The Finnish premium liquorice is currently available in several airports in Northern Europe, and there are ongoing negotiations with significant actors in Sweden and Central Europe. Interest in LIQ has been especially significant in Germany, which is fuelling the company’s current strong growth. “This has been a passion-driven project and our goal from the beginning has been to take LIQ into international markets and make it big,” says Nenonen. Looking ahead the company’s fresh flagship is a “super premium” concept that broadens the selection with a combination of liquorice and flavours such as chocolate or corn, freshly mixed on-site in a special mill. This artisan product creates a new taste experience that cannot be bought online and mobile shop-in-shops are already planned for several locations. “The customers can smell the liquorice when coming to the shop, and they get to taste fresh liquorice while we tell our story,” says Nenonen. Famed Finnish chef Tomi Björck has spearheaded the taste sensations."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/day-one-of-slush-2018-is-all-inclusive/,Day one of Slush 2018 is all inclusive,"The opening day of one of the world’s leading tech and startup events delivered on its annual promise to be the hub of innovation. At 10 am sharp, a hum emerges from the dimly lit stage. Two rappers emerge, spitting rhymes that cement the attitude of the biggest startup event in Europe: 2 400 volunteers participated in this year’s event. “Live on the edge – it’s my pledge.” Another oath that Slush abides by is its dedication to fresh perspectives. Since it was founded 10 years ago, it has largely been a student-run event, harnessing the pioneering enthusiasm of youth to fuel an impressive upward trajectory. The inaugural Slush attracted guests in their hundreds. This year’s attendee list is in the tens of thousands, some 2 400 of whom are student volunteers. The event’s scholarly roots are immediately front and centre with the first major announcement of the day. A global education programme for entrepreneurship, Slush Academy, is opening its doors next year. Developed in collaboration with the world’s leading universities, top-tier growth companies and VC firms, the academy will focus on internships in fast-growing startups and VC firms before scaling up to a full programme. “It’ll be free of charge, of course,” Slush CEO   added. “One characteristic of natural born entrepreneurs is they are missing the chip that says: this can’t be done,” said Julia Hartz, co-founder and CEO of Eventbrite. A theme of inclusiveness has been underlined by Slush this year, as companies look to make a global impact regardless of race, religion or gender. Slush 2018 also strives to shine the limelight on those people who help build companies, shifting focus away from the CEOs and founders who typically attract the accolades. Nokia chairperson  was the first guest speaker of the event, introducing the idea that all employees should feel a personal connection to their place of work. “How do we make all players think of their company as the car they own?” he asked. “Here [at Slush] we celebrate a sense of ownership.” The presence of the Nokia stalwart is an interesting choice. In the midst of its dizzying upward trajectory, one of Slush’s initial goals has remained the same: to remind the world that there is much more going on in Finland than Nokia. The facts have already come thick and fast on stage. Since the company’s fall from the dizzy heights of the pre-smartphone era, Finland has produced three startups worth more than 10 billion US dollars, with a dozen billion-plus startups in the making. All with less than 0.5 per cent of the world’s population. The European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, was impressed that Slush is an epicentre of innovation at the gloomiest time of the year. Across the Baltic Sea, and the population of Estonia is even smaller than Finland’s. Yet this nation of three million people has produced Europe’s youngest unicorn founder,  . A university dropout at 19, the 24-year-old CEO of Taxify has managed to ward off significant competitors, helping the taxi industry to digitalise and reach customers in the Uber age. “We’ve always been used to heavy competition,” he said. “But what we see is that if you manage to localise and build the best product for customers, then that platform is going to win out, regardless of how much capital the other ones have.” Despite the focus on newcomers and upstarts, there is no shortage of big players at Slush, too. The Samsung, Microsoft and Google logos glow above the sea of suits, hoodies and casual attire shuffling in between stages and stands. Many of these companies are presenting their own startup hubs and incubators, though, underlining their commitment to nurturing new ideas. Outside, puddles have formed on the walkway leading up to the Sauna Village, a cluster of saunas which together frame a courtyard of hot boxes. Steaming attendees fill a hot tub, the grey sky behind them interrupted only by wisps of fog. A stereotypical December day in Helsinki has delivered the event’s namesake, its title a bold ownership of perhaps the least favourable time to be in Finland’s capital. Indoors, the groundswell of big tech ideas is acknowledged by the European Commissioner for Competition,  . “This is the kind of energy, the kind of innovative potential that Europe needs,” she said. “This is what we are thriving on. We have a long list of problems and we need people who see the problems, realise the challenges but are creative, positive in also constructing our solutions.” Glancing around, the conversations emanating from the various stands and stages seemingly hum in agreement. Slush 2018 continues tomorrow. Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa was one of the first speakers on stage."

Take a look for yourself. Nightingale CCO Kristina Tolvanen (right) and Essi Lyytinen of Aava got ready to demonstrate a new robust concept of health assessment that combines Nightingale’s blood analysis technology with the lifestyle balance assessment of Aava, the fourth largest medical centre chain in Finland. Jari Salo presented the Finnish-made Silmu chair, which is not a chair, but a private space equipped with active noise cancellation, health applications that do not require wearable gadgets, as well as audio and video experiences. Salo hopes that the chair will help people worldwide to fight stress and encourage feelings of the calm, wellbeing and health that Finns enjoy daily. Spark Sustainability CEO Amanda Reijström (left) invited Slush participants to move from climate talk to taking real action by capturing themselves for an Instagram campaign to offset 100 kilos of emissions for each posted image. Based in Finland, Spark Sustainability is making sustainability visible for all and making sustainable choices easier by providing a discussion platform based on daily climate action questions. Good News from Finland played a table hockey game with Quuppa’s Ville Norra to test its accurate indoor positioning technology, which is used also in the Finnish hockey league. The result of the game was not so straightforward, however. The snow may have been nowhere to be found outside, but at least there was a snowman on offer indoors. The Finland stand offered attendees such as Ninni Virkki (left) and Kati Hiltunen from Business Finland an opportunity to immerse themselves in a winter experience by decorating a frosty friend with festive accessories. Russian company Samocat Sharing is installing 50 kick scooter stations around Helsinki in 2019, showcasing the future of city mobility. “Together with the support of Team Finland, we got a great opportunity to come to Helsinki with plans to expand further in Europe,” said founder Vasilii Bykov. “Our next step is to deploy winter pushbikes with Nokian tires, which we hope to have ready in one to two years.” What would Slush be without an astronaut? Kimmo Isbjörnssund of ESA Business Incubation Centre told about the future of business models that are created to work well in space as well as on Earth. Solar Foods making food from air is just one example. Promoting health and wellbeing, Oura’s content lead, senior data scientist and customer support specialist stuck to their planking routine – an office challenge they started a week ago to live up to their idea of healthy and balanced life. Props to them, since even Slush didn’t disrupt their dedication. Conor Lennon of Tampere-based startup Chargie showed their e-vehicle charging unit, which the company owners hope will help many people to not only charge their e-vehicles, but also to make money by selling their own electricity. In the Nordics, where preheating car engines is a norm due to cold winters, the infrastructure is already in place and the future looks brighter than ever for electric vehicles. “Every person thinking about buying a car should consider buying an electric car,” he said.         is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slush-day-two-finland-opens-its-doors-to-the-future/,Slush day two: Finland opens its doors to the future,"Diversity of tech industry ideas and those working with them is widely seen as a strength at Slush. Ice-cream in December – another great cultural experience at Slush. The average Finn enjoys 14 litres of ice-cream per year, the fourth-highest amount in the world. This figure is all the more impressive considering the mean winter temperature in Finland hovers somewhere below 0°C – no danger of melted ice-cream running down your wrist for five to six months of the year. At 10:15 am, the queue for free ice-cream was already five metres long at Slush. If there’s something that Finns like to do more than eat ice-cream, it’s supporting home-grown companies. Fittingly, staff are busily scooping balls of   onto cones for eager attendees. Nonetheless, for all of the support given to local talent, Finland is facing a global problem: insufficient supply of fresh tech expertise. An ageing society, coupled with one of the lowest birth rates in decades, is at odds with the needs of a rapidly digitalising world. Coding is in particular need of a talent injection, as the industry finally shakes off tired stereotypes of the mum’s basement-dwelling variety. “Coding is about creativity, problem solving and teamwork,” stated Supercell CEO  . “It’s not just nerds and geeks – we need people from all walks of life to get into coding.” “What is most important is to create an environment to learn, support and coach each other,” said Linda Liukas. One solution is a coding school,  , which is opening next year. Situated in the hip Helsinki neighbourhood of Kallio, the school has no classes, no teachers, no textbooks and no tuition fee. Students will instead work in teams, learning by doing to solve real-world problems. With Supercell heavily involved in the initiative, Paananen insists that the school isn’t a direct route to beef up coder numbers for the   behemoth. “It belongs to everybody,” he emphasised. This sentiment was echoed by  founder,  author and school chairperson,  . “What is most important is to create an environment to learn, support and coach each other,” she said. “The school is for everyone, all outliers and misfits, […] people with the curiosity and creativity to change the world.” The need for diversity in tech is not just being experienced in this relatively homogeneous corner of Europe. It extends across the whole continent and beyond. Investment in European tech reached 23 billion US dollars last year, European founders created 17 billion-dollar companies and Europe produced three of the 10 biggest venture-backed listings. Yet, this major driver of the economy is suffering a significant diversity and inclusion challenge. Slush is the place to meet interesting and diverse ideas. Case in point: around 93 per cent of all VC funds last year went to all-male founding teams. This funding stage represents a significant opportunity for change. As tech companies often grow very fast, diversity problems compound when not addressed early on. When a company is tens of thousands of people strong, the problem is difficult to fix. “VCs have two major roles to play,” outlined Diversity VC co-founder and CEO  . “One is making it a priority when talking to companies they are backing and seeing all the time that this is something that they should fix. The second thing is to use their resources and networks to source talent across the whole portfolio.” The initiative has reached the top of the food chain. is taking an active role in increasing diversity as CEO and founding partner at international technology investment firm Atomico. “We have conversations today with founders before we make an investment,” the co-founder of Skype and Kazam explained. “We talk about how they think about diversity, how they think about values. That gives a really good clue whether a company is going to be successful or not.” Zennström looks for founders who are leaning forward and being inclusive, thinking about diversity and building a strong value set early on. “Those are the companies that have a better chance of building a sustainable, profitable, long-term company. If founders don’t care about this, it is a really big red flag for us.” Actively addressing the issue of diversity and staff shortage is Andela, a US company specialised in training software developers. “In the US, there are five open jobs for every one software developer,” said co-founder and president . “We find that the continent of Africa is the largest pool of untapped talent in the world.” Finnish company Naava brought some fresh air to proceedings. The process is straightforward: Andela locates and screens tech talent, spending about seven months with them. The majority have a four-year degree in computer science or engineering before they come to Andela. The company works with them on critical tech stacks and soft skills that its partners tell that they want and then it matches them with suitable companies. “Africa is the youngest continent on Earth, representing the greatest opportunity for young talent,” Sass said. Lack of diversity and dearth of talent aren’t the only challenges that the tech industry is currently facing. If these words have been on many lips here for the past two days, then it is ‘misinformation’ that has captured the global imagination for the whole of 2018. Dictionary.com’s word of the year encapsulates the post-truth era, with increased resistance to traditional sales and marketing endeavours a direct result of this. Then there is the matter of the sheer volume of competition. “It has never been easier to start your own business,” stated HubSpot CEO  , “but it has never been harder to scale. There were 14 marketing software companies worldwide when I founded Hubspot. Now there are 8 000.” The path to success, Halligan pointed out, is not about having the best product. It’s about having a people-orientated approach. “Your customer experience needs to be 10 times better than the competition.” Once again, it is all about finding the right people. “The startup vibe is happening everywhere, whether in you are in Mumbai or in Memphis,” observed HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slush-through-a-lens-day-two/,"Slush 2018 through a lens, day two","Day two didn’t disappoint. Slush brought the visual feast for another dose of tech talk. “As we know, it takes a village to start a school,” mentioned Linda Liukas, when taking the stage to describe the concept of Hive Helsinki. She added that the coding school is intended for everyone who is open to new ideas and curious enough to enrol in the programme that has neither teachers, nor a degree for graduates. “We are looking forward to change the world with code,” she added. Forget draining your phone battery with GPS tracking! Here comes an innovation created with the support of Helsinki Innovation Services, part of the University of Helsinki. CEO Jari Strandman (left) presented Moprim and its CTO Julien Mineraud. The company’s new technology tracks people’s movement and mode of transport using signal processing to register the way their phone moves. All the while automatically calculating their carbon footprint, of course. “Our goal is to solve the big problems in the world, such as traffic congestion and bad air quality,” said Mineraud.   Looking for bright talent and sharing their image to the rest of the world, Finland’s largest media house Sanoma attracted a long queue with a colourful 360 video shoot stand at their booth. “My favourite thing so far has been meeting new people at Slush that I would probably never meet otherwise,” commented first-time attendee Netta Aavikko, a marketing analyst at Sanoma. The Zoan team, represented by its office manager Veera Varnamo (right), Janne Itäpiiri (left) and the designer Aki Hirvilammi (middle), demonstrated a virtual reality cube that gave Slush visitors an opportunity to travel to multiple places all over the Finnish capital area, such as Senate Square, the home of Alvar Aalto and Lonna island. “What I like about the virtual reality is how easy it puts smiles on people´s faces once they put on the glasses,” Veera said. CEO Maria Hakkarainen and CTO Andrey Smirnov from Robbo demonstrated their educational robot that is so intuitive that even preschoolers can make it move thanks to a simple user-friendly interface and transparent details. In cooperation with the cities of Helsinki and Espoo, the company will open ROBBO clubs for children, where parents can bring their curious children to grow a new generation of inventors. Finnish maritime and energy giant Wärtsilä came to Slush with a serious environmental message and intention to change the course of history. With the help of chroma key compositing technology, curious visitors found themselves on screen in the middle of a flood in a busy megapolis, realising quickly that things could get rough if the humanity does not change its ways. Viivi Marttinen, responsible for people operations at Supermetrics, says ‘yes’ to saving people from the intensive and laborious tasks involved in juggling marketing metrics between over 50 different platforms. Supermetrics makes things easier by putting all the fuss and buzz in one place. Who said that Slush is not for babies? Maija Hytti of the Academy for Future Leaders and her six-month-old baby girl Kerttu also attended Slush – an event, where a few years ago she met her husband, the CEO of Finnish innovation platform Keto. “Maybe Kerttu is a future startuper,” she added.   Busy street downstairs interrupting your sleep? Looking for some shut-eye on a long-haul flight, but the baby in front of you won’t stop crying? Your other half erupting with a deep bass rumble of snoring every night? The noise cancelling earplugs of QuietOn might just be the solution. “Snoring affects 25 per cent of people regularly in the US,” CEO Janne Kyllönen told. “We were able to miniaturize active noise cancelling so you can sleep.” At the end of the day, there is always time for sauna, at least if you are in Finland. In the Sauna Village in the December rain, we found Finns, Danes and Dutch immersed in a steamy hot tub after the sauna. Surprise surprise, in the hot tub we met Saara Louhensalo (right), who we found in exactly the same place last year. “Good news from Finland!” Louhensalo cheered."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/woodly-could-soon-be-on-everyone-s-lips/,Woodly could soon be on everyone’s lips,"Espoo-based Welmu International believes it has created what could become the first packaging material brand recognised by consumers worldwide, Woodly. As consumers are becoming more and more aware of the colossal plastic problem facing the world today, many are also growing frustrated with the lack of opportunities to reduce the amount of plastic waste they produce. The European Commission, for example, has   that 94 per cent of the public view that products should be designed to ease recycling and that industry and retailers should reduce plastic packaging, which currently  . “Consumers are demanding alternative materials from brand owners,” says  , the CEO of  . “They are the last loop in every value chain – they vote with their feet and change the chains. There have been lots of ecological trends over the years, but now the pressure is real as consumers have started to talk about this over the past couple of years. Brand owners feel that they have to make investments, which puts pressure on manufacturing industries.” Järvikylä will start sending its potted herbs and greens to retailers wrapped in Woodly in 2019. This is as much an ethical obligation as it is a business opportunity for Welmu International. The Finnish startup was founded in 2011 specifically to explore the possibility of developing a wood-based alternative for plastics. “It started as a shrink film project, but after sitting down with brand owners we realised that wasn’t the way to go. There were use cases that were technologically easier but in higher demand,” recounts Kaminen. “Over the past few years, we’ve found a recipe that has allowed us to step out of the lab and move on to industrial-scale trials with our partners.” The recipe has produced Woodly, a growing family of transparent plastic-free packaging materials made primarily of coniferous cellulose: Woodly 100 is a heat-sealable film for herbs and other food products, Woodly 200 an injection-mouldable hard material for drink and food containers, and Woodly 300 a coating material for take-out and other cardboard containers. The material was recently  , a competition for innovative wood-based solutions organised by Uusi puu -hanke ( ). It is set to hit the shelves of grocery shops next year, enveloping the potted herbs and greens of  . Negotiations and pilot projects with other potential clients are ongoing both in and outside Finland, according to Kaminen. “The choices you make as a consumer are important, as making sustainable decisions is a way to increase demand for sustainably produced products and materials,” stresses Jaakko Kaminen, CEO of Welmu International. “Our goal is for this to become a cost-effective material. The raw material costs will initially be two to three times as high as for traditional [oil-based] plastics, but that’s purely a volume issue. We’re talking only about a fraction of the end product’s price, no more than a couple of cents,” he highlights. Welmu International, he adds, is also intent on establishing the brand as a household name among consumers. “We don’t want to be a faceless operator at the start of the value chain. We’re building the world’s first and most well known packaging materials brand, and five years from now we’ll be a globally recognised packaging materials brand – the first of its kind,” he declares. Woodly has an advantage over the competition for three reasons, says Kaminen. It boasts the necessary mechanical properties, is not excessively expensive and requires no investments in new technologies or infrastructure from plastics manufacturers. “There’s no need to invest in production facilities, to build new infrastructure to compete against plastics. That becomes a bottleneck for scaling up, making it more complicated to seek funding” he points out. “We’re looking to create partnerships, not to position ourselves as an enemy of the plastics industry.” “The industry is what will eventually solve the plastic problem, and its infrastructure can be utilised in the process,” he tells."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-what-we-learned-at-slush-2018/,Five for Friday: What we learned at Slush 2018,"Slush Helsinki featured 3 100 startups, 21 000 participants and a couple of million great ideas.  has grown from a makeshift gathering of student entrepreneurs to the hottest high-tech conference in the Nordic region. When it gets dark and slushy every autumn, people from around the globe meet in Helsinki to share notes, make deals and see what is happening in the world of technology and entrepreneurship. Here are five exciting things we learnt this year. Education was a major theme at this year’s Slush, emphasised by two different projects. Supercell CEO   announced  , a new kind of coding school based on the French Ecole 42. The free programme is open to those aged 18–30 and is aimed at deepening and broadening programming skills. Meanwhile, Slush announced  , a modern global education programme for entrepreneurship. Many universities lack adequate entrepreneurship courses, so Slush Academy includes a personalised curriculum based on work with startups and venture capitalists. Companies have made great strides in developing and commercialising machine learning. Some of the startups on display include Lifemote, which manages wi-fi for ISPs, Signality, which uses AI to extract data from real-time videos, and Nitor, which is a specialist at digitising services. And, of course, we can’t forget interactive machine learning company Meeshkan, the winner of the Slush 100 pitching competition. There will always be a place in the world for the mad scientist, the solitary inventor working alone in her lab. Yet increasingly the process today is co-creation through ecosystems. One of the best examples of this is healthtech. Finland’s health technology startups work with researchers in universities and both patients and doctors in hospitals in order to build the best solutions. Repeatedly Slush participants stressed the need for working together. Thanks in no small part to SpaceX’s  , space is moving out of the hands of massive government agencies. In 2018, the Finnish microsatellite company   launched two satellites and raised 34 million US dollars in funds. Not to be outdone,   has also launched a satellite in collaboration with Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre. Finland’s space endeavours are helping us to understand our planet, communicate and navigate. People like cool gadgets and neat tech, but technology is simply an enabler so we can have better lives. Healthtech can make us healthier while wellbeing apps can help us to be happier. New advances in technology can boost our sustainability. In fact, Slush has a special Global Impact Accelerator programme for startups who offer sustainable and social impact solutions. After all, at the end of the day Slush is not about money or tech. It’s about people."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/exomi-s-mobile-authentication-fights-data-breaches/,Exomi’s mobile authentication fights data breaches,"Major data leaks are in the headlines almost daily. Finnish technology company Exomi taps into our mobile devices to safeguard our identities and information online. Facebook, Uber, Yahoo and British Airways. These are just a few of the big companies hit by significant data breaches in recent years. While digitalisation offers many conveniences, it comes with an increased risk of compromised personal information.   believes the key to protecting consumers’ identities online is better third-party login services. “We have brought to the market a mobile identity platform, which enables consumers to use their mobile devices for authentication instead of needing separate usernames and passwords for different digital services,” explains  , CEO at Exomi. The platform, called Exomi Mobile Identity (XMI), is targeted at mobile operators. With XMI, operators can offer their customers a secure digital identity to log into all apps and web services and authorise transactions. Users can easily control which services they give authorisation to and revoke access any time they like without worrying about their data being sold to marketers or other companies. There is a big market for our products,” Joakim Nylund says. In addition to appealing to privacy-concerned consumers, the platform helps to make operators compliant with the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, which came into force in May 2018. Exomi may not be a familiar name to the masses, but the company has long (and eventful) roots in the telecoms industry. Parts of the company date back to 1984, while its focus on wireless technologies started in 1996. Since then, Exomi’s mobile messaging and data infrastructure products have been deployed in over 170 wireless networks. A new chapter for the Espoo-based company started in 2010. This was when its current management bought out the company from US corporation RealNetworks, which had acquired Exomi in 2007. For the past seven years, the company has focused on developing new products. Further to XMI, it has introduced a new messaging service for mobile operators based on the GSM Association’s Rich Communications Service standard. “It’s an alternative to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger,” explains Nylund. “The platform has similar features but, when the messaging service is provided by a local operator, the users’ privacy is protected by the same laws that govern all other operator traffic and is not run through datacentres in the US.” Exomi is not alone in the market, but its advantage comes from its long experience in the telecoms industry. For example, the XMI service has been developed in close collaboration with the company’s operator clients. Being Finnish has a good ring to it everywhere. Timing is also on Exomi’s side. According to Nylund, European companies offering these services are few and far between, while GDPR and tightening local legislation have driven demand up for EU-based players. “Being Finnish has a good ring to it everywhere,” Nylund says.” Finnish companies are considered reliable and trustworthy, while it may not be the same for our China- or US-based competitors.” Despite Exomi’s Finnish roots, Europe is a fairly new market for the company. Nylund estimates that 95 per cent of the company’s turnover comes from abroad, but mostly from Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. “After the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, investment was low in Europe and the US but not in Latin America. They had many competing network technologies from Europe and the US which we had experience in. This gave us an advantage there,” Nylund recalls. “Now we are building up our visibility in Europe, where we haven’t operated for a while.” This geographical expansion also represents a new focus for Exomi. Now that the company has its mobile identity and messaging services on the market, it’s time for growth. “We have focused on product development for many years. Now we want to invest in sales and marketing. There is a big market for our products,” Nylund concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-2018-s-biggest-investment-rounds/,Five for Friday: 2018’s biggest investment rounds,"This quintet has made headlines this year for closing significant funding rounds. 2018 has been a big year for attracting big bucks, with these five innovative companies at the top of the financial heap. Earlier this month, the development of an ambitious undersea rail link between Helsinki and Tallinn was boosted by a 100 million-euro investment. “To have the first external funding is a significant step for the whole project […]. The Helsinki-Tallinn area will in the future be one of the fastest-growing [metropolises] in Europe,”   former   executive  , who is leading the project. Back in May, the exclusive licensee for Nokia’s phones and tablets raised an additional 100 million US dollars to scale up operations and fuel growth. “It is our ambition to deliver great smartphones that delight our fans while staying true to our Finnish roots and the hallmarks that the Nokia brand has always been known for,”    , CEO of HMD Global. “We aim to be among the top smartphone players globally and our success to date gives us the confidence to further continue on a growth path in 2018 and beyond.” This Small Giant got a whole lot bigger in February, after EQT Ventures, Creandum, Spintop Ventures and Profounders pitched in due to the strength of its runaway hit,  “The [studio’s] strong, data-driven entrepreneurial team had a clear vision of what it wanted to achieve, and it’s delivering on that,”    , partner at EQT Ventures. “Small Giant Games has achieved great traction and is determined to become a global winner.” By May, a total of 53 million US dollars had been raised by this Finnish microsatellite manufacturer, as it sought to reach its goal of nine satellite launches by the end of 2019. “This funding secures our goal of deploying the world’s largest SAR satellite constellation before the end of next year,”   chief executive and co-founder  . The world’s first human-eye resolution VR/XR product received a considerable financial boost in October. “It’s because of Varjo’s world-class team that industries such as automotive, engineering, aerospace, architecture, construction, industrial design and real-world training simulations won’t have to wait that long to be able to utilise the technology for their business-critical use cases,”   funding partner Atomico’s  .”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kisakallio-brings-phenomenal-learning-and-winter-sports-to-china/,Kisakallio brings phenomenal learning and winter sports to China,"Finland is world-renowned for its education system and doesn’t fare poorly in winter sports either. Now the two have come together in a unique range of education export products which are proving popular in China.  The 2022 Winter Olympics are just around the corner, and Kisakallio is well positioned. The Chinese government has an ambitious goal. It wants to create 300 million new winter sports enthusiasts by the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. For Finns – who consider skiing, skating and general frolicking in the snow as national pastimes – this has opened the door to a new kind of educational export. Lohja-based Kisakallio Sports Institute has been one of the first to seize this opportunity. “We have over 70 years’ experience in sports education and teaching sports skills,” says  ,  ’s marketing director. “Now we want to teach Olympic winter sports to the Chinese and help them to understand the possibilities in combining education with sports.” Kisakallio has hit the ground running. The sports institute is already training Chinese coaches in 15 Olympic winter sports, helping students to get on skis and skates as part of its Sport to Campus concept and designing China’s first Finnish-style sports institute for the eastern city of Weifang. Kisakallio has also developed a PopUp School concept to offer Chinese children the opportunity to study like Finns. “We built the PopUp School curriculum based on the Finnish phenomenon-based learning model and the belief that physical activity is an important part of learning,” Hollo explains. “We believe a physically active child is more likely to be active in their education.” “We want to help the Chinese understand the possibilities in combining education with sports,” says Harri Hollo. International projects are not new for Kisakallio. The sports institute offers facilities, training and upper secondary education in various sports and attracts professional and amateur sports enthusiasts from over 50 countries annually. But with China, Kisakallio has taken these operations to a whole new level. It began in spring 2017, when the institute launched its first joint-venture with Chinese investors called Kisakallio China. It is tasked with promoting Kisakallio’s educational concepts in China. The most successful to date has been the camp-style PopUp School, which last summer resulted in 15 groups of 12-to-18-year-olds coming to Finland to study with Finnish teachers and students. “The feedback has been very positive. When Chinese children come to a Finnish school, they are free to study and think differently,” says Hollo. “We want to bring different cultures together and create new learning opportunities for children.” Learning is also at the core of Kisakallio’s Sport to Campus concept. This is a full winter sports education package for students, teachers and coaches covering equipment, rules, techniques and sports culture. Kisakallio has even developed removable ice to create temporary ice rinks wherever they are needed. “There aren’t enough winter sports facilities in China yet, so these innovations are needed,” Hollo explains. 2019 will be an even busier year for Kisakallio China. It marks the first winter sports co-operation year between China and Finland with over 100 events being held in the two countries. Kisakallio will participate in many of them as part of the state-sponsored Finnish Winter Sports Cluster, organised by Business Finland. Kisakallio is also planning to expand its PopUp School concept and bring Finnish teachers and students to work with their local counterparts in China. There is even talk about a Chinese winter sports reality TV show, which is scheduled to start shooting in Finland in January. Hollo says Kisakallio is happy with its start in China and believes the institute has developed a model for further international success. “[In China] we are a startup company and we still have a lot to learn about the culture and processes,” he emphasises. “But we are now building our operational models and, eventually, we want to take these concepts around the world.” The PopUp School curriculum combines phenomenon-based learning and daily physical activity."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-our-most-popular-articles-in-2018/,Five for Friday: Our most popular articles in 2018,"This quintet were the most-read articles on Good News from Finland during the past year, showcasing a range of innovations. From an energy epicentre to eco-friendly swimwear, solar water solutions, map creation and airport item retrieval, Finnish innovations were diverse in their appeal in 2018 A third of Finland’s total energy technology exports come from the vibrant energy cluster located in the coastal city of Vaasa. Home to almost 70 000 people, the humble face of the city belies an energetic core. In fact, one that has coined the label: the energy capital of the Nordics. “Today electrical and automation technology are huge in Vaasa,” said  , communication and brand manager of the energy cluster EnergyVaasa. “The Vaasa region is responsible for almost all of the Finnish development in this sector.” Not quite a rags to riches story; more so a trash to eco-friendliness-in-style tale. Finland’s first sustainable swimwear brand was born out of two friends’ quest to find bikinis that both looked and felt good. But when   and   decided to start their own swimwear company in 2016, not everyone was convinced. “People thought we were crazy,” Valkonen recalled. “Summer in Finland is short and trying to make swimwear was seen as a big risk.” Over two billion people worldwide use a contaminated source for their drinking water. It is a striking statistic, and one Finnish cleantech company Solar Water Solutions believes it can help to change. “The estimate is close to half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2040,” said  , CEO of Solar Water Solutions. “We can produce clean water locally and with free solar energy. The market for these kinds of technologies is huge.” This Finnish startup launched a free phone wallpaper generator that blew up on Reddit and successfully boosted the profile of its raison d’être: customised map posters. The company’s name is a play on words of revered Finnish designer Alvar Aalto. It now has designs on the future. “The stunt increased our sales five-fold, so it really has had a huge impact,” software developer  said. “Now, we are already making a profit. There are only a few steps left to being able to do this full-time.” A miserable experience at airport security led to the creation of Cotio, a Finnish startup reuniting passengers with items seized by airport security. The idea is simple: Whenever airport security staff remove an item from a passenger, they place a sticker with an identification code on the item and present the passenger with a receipt for the surrendered item. A similar receipt will be used to replace any items removed from checked baggage. “Passengers don’t enjoy having to hand over their items – and like getting them back. Some items may have emotional value that can’t be measured in money. They’re especially important,” explained founder and chief executive  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/virtual-traveller-goes-places-in-the-blink-of-an-eye/,Virtual Traveller goes places in the blink of an eye,"This Finnish company aims to become the global number one 360-degree travel video hotspot, as well as a win-win platform for content producers and users, travel agencies, and tourist boards. Where in the world would you go if you could go anywhere? The ‘if’ in the common question entails a lot of factors: many of us lack either the money or the time (or both) to travel to all our dream destinations, and some of us have physical inabilities or health restrictions that stop us from fulfilling our travel-related dreams. On some level,   gives people a chance to chase these dreams as the host of the Finnish version of   On top of being seen on TV, he’s a well-known radio host and a serial entrepreneur. At   2015, he tried on VR glasses for the first time and was well impressed. Disappointed to find out that not much content was available at the time, he decided it was time to change the state of things and, at the same time, bring travel dreams just that little bit closer to reality. Today,   is the CEO of Linnonmaa’s brainchild:  , an online platform for sharing and viewing 360-degree videos from fascinating places in all corners of the world. “Jaajo started out wanting to bring the world to people who, for whatever reason, can’t go see it for themselves,” Kivirauma explains. “But as the idea grew, various other applications came up.” They did, indeed. CEO Donna Kivirauma is passionate about finding ways to help people connect. After building a team and receiving an injection of external funding, Virtual Traveller partnered up with Finnair. The deal means that content producers are rewarded with frequent flyer points – one point per each view with no upper limit whatsoever. Another partnership, to be announced in January, will be with technology giant Samsung. Kivirauma notes that 360-degree cameras and VR glasses are becoming increasingly inexpensive, making contributing to Virtual Traveller possible for many more people. As the scope of the content grows, anyone with a decent internet connection can jump on an adventure pretty much anywhere in the world, either with a local or a traveller. On top of travel enthusiasts, Virtual Traveller provides opportunities to destination marketers. Popular tourist cities can make use of the platform to introduce less-travelled paths, as they try to spread tourism and lessen the burden on the most common, overcrowded stomping grounds. For locals, Virtual Traveller is a way of showing off hidden gems and unique things about cultures and environments. In short, Virtual Traveller is a combination of its founder’s and CEO’s personal favourites. “Everyone has to find their personal passion that’s based upon a purpose, the ‘why’ of what they’re doing,” Kivirauma tells. “Jaajo wanted to bring the world to people, and I’ve always been passionate about positively connecting people so that they can understand and appreciate each other.” To be able to serve as many people as possible, Virtual Traveller is free for content providers and viewers, and the money comes instead from partnerships, collaborations and travel-related advertising. In order to reach different language groups, content providers can use any language they wish. The 13-strong Virtual Traveller team has also built connections in a pilot with a Finnish school, enabling kids to share their everyday life with peers from other cultures. Kivirauma emphasises the importance of education in the process she calls ‘global healing’. “There’s so much misunderstanding in the world right now. Giving opportunities to tackle that is what motivates us and drives us forward.” 360-degree storytelling is, in Kivirauma’s view, a growing phenomenon. With the camera pointing everywhere, even the person filming can spot new things in hindsight. “360 virtual reality isn’t mainstream yet, but it’s headed that way, as it’s a great media for engaging people. You can surprise people time and time again, because there’s always another angle.” Kivirauma has no trouble thinking of a time when she would’ve loved to record her travel experience in 360 degrees. “Last summer, my husband and I went to Greece on our 10-year anniversary and got remarried on the beach. My husband didn’t want to have a 360-degree camera with us, but later he was sorry we didn’t bring it. We found so many incredible spots, and now we could feel like we’re standing in the same places again and relive the moment.” Virtual Traveller’s 360-degree image means that a single video just keeps on giving – just change the angle."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/coachilla-makes-matches-that-can-change-lives/,Coachilla makes matches that can change lives,"Not all who wander are lost – they just need a little nudge. Finnish Coachilla has created a platform to help the nudgers and nudgees find each other, so dreams can start happening. Many of the people who are unhappy with their current job situation   know what they’d rather be doing. They just, for whatever reason, haven’t quite pursued it yet. That was the situation for  , co-founder and CEO of  , as he was working for a few different startups after finishing his studies. The startup world had always been his target, but he found himself lacking purpose. “It was agonising to understand my work wasn’t bettering the world, really,” he recalls. “For example, bringing more stuff into the world didn’t feel like it was for the good of anyone, which made it seem meaningless.” It was only when Nieminen met a few coaches that he began to realise how much he was in charge of things. He started to change his ways of thinking and acting, ranging from project management practices to how he defined passion in his career. “I realised that I can’t get anything done unless I feel passionate about it,” he tells. “It’s really valuable to acknowledge that you have to believe in what you do, and that made me contemplate what makes me tick and what I could do for others to feel the same.” Now, the answer is right here: Coachilla helps professionals to meet verified, professional career and life coaches to support them in seeking new directions and simultaneously provides coaches with a marketplace for their services. For Eeppi Nieminen (right), coaching was a life-changing experience. Coachilla has been a dream-come-true for Nieminen, who had always had a plan of eventually founding his own company. The idea was born when he met  , his former friend from university, and told him about how much help he had received from different coaches. Kinnunen himself had been looking for one but struggled: a Google search for “career coach” brought up countless results. Boom. The duo realised they had identified two problems, one from each side of the market, that could be solved at once. jumped on board as the third co-founder, and the first version of the service was tested with friends and other volunteers. This proved profitable: Coachilla landed its very first paying clients. Soon, some angel investors stepped in to up the game. Now, a beta version is available, and an actual launch awaits in 2019. First, the efforts will focus on North America, where most of the registered coaches currently hail from. The long-term plans include new language versions of the platform, although coaching is already available in about a dozen languages. Nieminen believes Coachilla is hitting the market at just the right time. All the talk about millennials keeps repeating how today’s young adults can no longer be motivated with mere money; meaning has grown more important. Mental wellbeing and self-development are both huge and continuously growing markets. “Working life is changing rapidly and people need to reflect on the ways they are part of it,” Nieminen notes. “Many of us are looking for self-actualisation, so that we ourselves can define what’s important.” Coachilla has ambitious growth plans around the globe. Not everyone jumping at the opportunities in the industry are trained professionals, however, and some bad apples have affected the credibility of the career coaching scene in general. Coachilla ensures that all service providers have training that is verified by the International Coach Federation or a similar body. On top of providing them a marketplace, Coachilla offers marketing services. The coaching itself happens on Coachilla’s platform, and the company charges a commission on the sales. Currently, Coachilla runs on the energy of five people, with all three founders included in the team. In four to five years, Nieminen sees himself leading a company of over 50 people globally and Coachilla becoming the global go-to place for coaches and the people looking for them. He has got a good reason to believe in the success: after all, he’s a textbook example of what coaching can lead to. Although all jobs have bad days, now he’s much happier than he used to be. “These days I’m more than satisfied with what I do for a living. The best thing about this job is that I get to see the changes that are taking place, people feeling empowered, finding their full potential and making dreams come true.”"

Wherever she has been and whomever she has met, people have brought up one thing about her country of origin: education. “Be it Nigeria, India or Brazil, or a taxi driver in Chile, I was constantly told that ‘you guys have the best education system’. I began to realise the level of brand recognition.” People kept on asking for solutions that could help implement similar practices in their own countries, and Laitio did seek for them – to no avail. The next question she had in mind was pretty obvious for someone who has worked with business, development, impact and scalable solutions: Can Finnish education be packaged and brought to [fill in the blank with the name of any country]? “Brits, Canadians, Americans and Singaporeans seemed to be branding and scaling their school chains. I couldn’t help but wonder why Finns weren’t doing it.” Laitio pitched the thought of combining Finnish teacher training, curriculum, design and technology to her then-colleagues at the World Bank in Washington. By the time she had finished, their only concern was: “What are you still doing here talking? All talk, no action!” Dr Jonna Kangas (left), FinlandWay school pupils and staff in Santiago de Surco, Lima, Peru, and Noora Laitio (right). However, as an economist and not an education expert, Laitio needed a specialist partner to begin realising her vision. She stumbled across the name of Dr  , a researcher and lecturer at the University of Helsinki and an internationally published author in participatory play-based pedagogy, and decided to send her a message with an ambitious subject line: “Would you like to save the world with me?” “It probably sounded pretty naïve,” Laitio admits laughingly – but it all lead to the two women, previously unknown to each other, founding a company and establishing a concept called  . Together, Laitio and Kangas started studying end-user needs and developing research-based educational content and a framework for the entire package. The first pilots were conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the help of funding from Finnpartnership, and later further tests were made in São Paulo as well as Lima, Peru. A lot has happened since: currently, requests and contacts are flooding in from dozens of countries to the six-strong FinlandWay team. FinlandWay schools have been established Brazil, Peru and Vietnam, with expansion plans both in Latin America and in Southeast Asia – and elsewhere when the time is right. Laitio emphasises that the company wants to make FinlandWay an accessible solution to the world’s growing middle classes. “We don’t aim for premium pricing but want to offer premium quality,” Laitio concludes. Being economically accessible without compromising on quality is a core part of the company’s philosophy. FinlandWay serves both new and existing schools. All practices are research-based, and the goal is to train local teachers to adopt Finnish teaching methods and technologies. Laitio notes that the system also supports reporting the results of the whole school, as well as individual students. This helps to increase transparency between schools and homes and gets parents involved in their child’s schooling, too. “In Finland, families tend to trust schools and teachers, but globally that’s not always the case,” she points out. “Especially in countries where education is expensive and the institutions differ remarkably in terms of quality, parents want to be sure they are getting their money’s worth and their child is getting the best education available.” Laitio believes that the fact that the concept has the word ‘Finland’ in it adds to the team’s motivation. Acting like a brand ambassador for the country’s education system makes them really want to do things to the highest possible standard. “The values of sustainable development, equality, wellbeing and solidarity are something we’re proud to be spreading through FinlandWay. Even if my first email to Dr Kangas was a little naïve, we genuinely want to create better beginnings for children and families around the world.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/leanheat-smartens-up-building-management/,Leanheat smartens up building management,"Good indoor climate meets minimal energy consumption at Finnish tech company Leanheat. The company wants to put an energy-efficient end to fluctuating indoor temperatures. Buildings, particularly older ones, are energy hogs. They account for 40 per cent of all energy consumption in Europe. But   believes new digital technologies can bring this number down drastically without any compromise on our living conditions. The company is behind a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered management system which optimises indoor climate and energy efficiency in apartment buildings. “We make buildings smarter,” says  , CEO at Leanheat. “In particular, we focus on the control and maintenance of heating and ventilation in centrally heated properties.” Leanheat’s system (also called Leanheat) is fuelled by data. All flats covered by the system are equipped with sensors to monitor changes in temperature and humidity. Leanheat combines this data with peaks and lows in energy demand across the building, takes into account potential weather changes and automatically adjusts the heating to maintain an amiable indoor climate with minimal energy usage. “All the data is gathered in the cloud and our software calculates millions of different paths for heating control and sends instructions back to the central heating,” Aho explains. “Residents don’t have to do anything, but they should notice more stable living conditions while building owners receive smaller heating bills and district heating companies will see a cut in peak power demand.” Leanheat uses artificial intelligence to keep apartment buildings consistently warm and cosy with reduced energy consumption. Smart heating is a competitive industry today, but Leanheat has some aces up its sleeve. The company targets entire buildings and building clusters, instead of individual flats, and collaborates with district heating companies. In addition to savings in energy costs and consumption, Leanheat also promises benefits for building maintenance. “Our system constantly monitors a building,” Aho explains. “We can detect if the heating system starts to work even slightly inefficiently and intervene before any major faults occur.” Aho first had the idea for Leanheat in 2011. Back then, he was working at another Finnish company, Pandia, a specialist in financial software for real estate companies. “Our customers were complaining that when they invest in, for example, better insulation they know how it affects energy consumption but not the indoor climate,” Aho recalls. “We started to ask why don’t they measure living conditions inside an apartment.” This question formed the core of Leanheat’s first version. Pandia piloted it in 2014 with 4 000 flats in Finland and, as demand grew, Leanheat was spun off into a separate company in 2016. Today Leanheat is installed in a total of 100 000 flats across Europe and China. While the company is looking to grow into new markets, China represents a huge opportunity for the company and is already its second biggest market. “There are maybe a million apartments in Finland suitable for our system, but in China already our first pilot customer heats over two million apartments,” Aho enthuses. “Currently we work with six district heating companies in China and have nine ongoing commercial pilot projects.” Customers like these are crucial for Leanheat’s ambitious goal: over one million installations by the end of 2022. But numbers aren’t all that drive Leanheat. The company believes AI and data will revolutionise the way properties are maintained in future, and it wants to play a vital role in this development. So far, the signs are promising. “In 2014 we sat staring at heating charts with our Finnish key customers and now we are contributing to cleaner air in Beijing,” Aho says. “It feels unbelievable.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-china-finland-year-of-winter-sports-2019/,Five for Friday: China-Finland Year of Winter Sports,"This year sees China and Finland teaming up for a first-of-its-kind sporty partnership. Government representatives from China and Finland met this week in Beijing for the official launch of the China-Finland Year of Winter Sports 2019, which had originally been committed to by the presidents of China and Finland,   and  , in April 2017. The two presidents were present at the official signing ceremony on 14 January to launch the year of special co-operation. The joint partnership theme year marks the first-of-its-kind bilateral co-operation in sports between China and another country. The China-Finland Year of Winter Sports 2019 will conclude with official closing ceremonies in Rovaniemi, Finland, in December 2019. Here are five takeaways from the collaboration. The People’s Republic of China and Finland have a long history in sport co-operation. Soon after forming diplomatic relations in 1950, China sent a team to the Helsinki 1952 Olympic Games. In order to build a strong winter sports culture, China has allocated resources to develop infrastructure for winter sports in the build-up to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Major investments are being made in the development of physical education in schools, the Sport for All movement and from mass sports all the way to high-performance sports. The China-Finland Year of Winter Sports is a collaboration on many levels between the cities, areas and businesses of Finland and China. Both sides will collaborate with government representatives, cities and companies, as well as sport organisations and sport institutes. The theme year will not only be about sports but also extend to culture, education, research and training. Besides governmental cooperation, businesses and everyday people are expected to benefit from the collaboration. Winter sports opportunities in China have generated great interest among Finnish companies and cities. This past week alone, over 15 memoranda of understanding were signed between Finnish and Chinese partners. Among the Finnish companies and organisations signing contracts were  ,  ,  ,   and the  . Finland is committed to long term co-operation with China, which aspires to reach the top in winter sports in terms of both the success of its winter athletes and building a strong winter sports culture in China. Tourism to Finland also stands to benefit from the China-Finland year of sports. Finland is already known as a winter destination, famous for the Northern Lights and Santa Claus, ice and snow. It is also a destination with great ski resorts, excellent sporting academies and a number of high-quality coaching and sport educational institutes and facilities. Finland has the cleanest air in the world, and it offers safety, purity and space for Chinese families, groups and individuals learning to ski. China has set a target of 300 million winter sport enthusiasts, which creates a huge touristic opportunity for Finnish ski resorts all over the country, providing work opportunities for professional ski instructors and skiing schools. Finland can offer also low-threshold winter sport teaching by professional skiing instructors at skiing resorts, to those interested in picking up winter sports as a hobby. In 2019, a pair of airlines will also begin flying between China and Finland, with Tibet Airlines   between Helsinki and Jinan, Shangdong, on 8 April and Juneyao Airlines   between Helsinki and Shanghai on 28 June. In addition, Finnair will launch twice-daily flights between Hong Kong and Helsinki in the summer."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gradient-delivers-sound-that-takes-you-places/,Gradient delivers sound that takes you places,"Gradient, a Finnish designer and manufacturer of hi-fi loudspeakers, has been at the cutting edge of high-end speaker acoustics for decades. must have been at least somewhat anxious standing behind the podium at the Audio Engineering Society (AES) Convention in Montreux, Switzerland, in March 1982. The 34-year-old head of acoustics at Lohja Electronics was about to contend to an international audience of audiophiles and audio industry professionals that, as far as most end users were concerned, loudspeaker manufacturers had made hardly any noteworthy progress for the past couple of decades. Salmi and his assistant,  , had studied how speakers interact with the listening environment by comparing original input signals to recordings of the output signals of various speakers in two distinct settings: an anechoic chamber and ordinary living room. Jorma Salmi (1948–2018), the co-founder of Finland’s Gradient, has been described as one of the greatest modern-day theoreticians of speaker acoustics by The Absolute Sound. The findings were groundbreaking. Almost all speakers of reasonably high quality performed well in the anechoic chamber but, once moved into the living room, differences began to emerge. The conclusion drawn by the duo was that loudspeaker designers should focus not only on achieving a flat anechoic frequency response but also on speaker-room compatibility. “The influence of the listening room on speaker performance was largely unknown at the time,” tells  , the son of Jorma Salmi and CEO of  . “The room definitely has an impact on what comes out.” Jorma Salmi continued to study the interplay between speakers and the listening environment for two more years before founding Gradient in 1984 together with  and  . The timing was opportune. , the largest music university in the Nordics, was expanding and ordered speakers for its new facilities in Helsinki. The order not only kept the company busy for the first few years but also helped it to establish a reputation especially among classical musicians and classical music fans. “The first speakers were designed to be as room-independent as possible,” tells Atte Salmi, who acquired the business in 2010. Gradient’s latest speaker design, the Gradient 1.4, has received rave reviews from around the world. The same goal continues to steer the design process today and has earned the company recognitions from many of the most influential high-end audio publications in the world. Gradient’s Revolution and Helsinki 1.5 speakers, for example, have both received the coveted Golden Ear Award from  . “It feels funny to say, but we really are world leaders in terms of dispersion control and controlled directivity, as has been recognised widely,” says Salmi. The speakers are designed, manufactured and assembled completely in Finland. Some of the parts are made by contract manufacturers in Lahti and Myrskylä, while the final assembly is carried out in Porvoo by Gradient. In addition, 80–90 per cent of the raw materials are sourced from Finland, according to Salmi. They sound, well, like nothing. “I realise it seems like an awful thing to say, but the speakers don’t sound like anything,” he remarks with a chuckle. “Speakers should be transparent: they should take you to the original recording location and disappear into the soundstage without causing or allowing the room to cause any colourations.” Salmi tells that, despite the accolades, the high-end audio market remains difficult to penetrate, let alone to conquer. Finland alone is home to more than half-a-dozen well-known companies manufacturing speakers in the 1 000–10 000-euro price range. This, he views, is due to both a low entry threshold to the market and a long tradition in audio engineering education. Gradient has a very functional approach to product design and strives for as minimalistic a design language as possible, tells Atte Salmi, the CEO of Gradient. “Another thing – and this is completely my own interpretation – is that people living in a country where the climate is so dreary that they spend most of their time indoors are encouraged to make things that have a positive effect on the quality of life indoors,” analyses Salmi. Gradient has devoted resources especially to seeking growth in markets where it has already seized the attention of audiophiles through positive product reviews and participation in audio technology fairs. The US is particularly appealing, although the company ships products to over 20 countries around the world. “International sales are making up a growing share of our sales – currently around 50–60 per cent,” says Salmi. But one challenge persists from market to market: how to appeal to young consumers who may have never sat down in the so-called sweet spot and let the music sweep them to iconic places such as Abbey Road Studios in London, the UK, or the Village Vanguard in New York City, the US? “Our customer base may be leaning too heavily towards the 40–120 age group,” jokes Salmi. “But the message we’re trying to get across is that new audio formats and portable music players haven’t changed the realities at all: passive speakers, such as the ones we make, are an interface that’s compatible with both old record players and smart-device-controlled music streamers.” “If you want to fill your home with good sound, nothing has changed,” he affirms."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sugar-daddies-co-makes-world-saving-a-sweet-treat/,Sugar Daddies Co makes world-saving a sweet treat,"Bees will be bees – if only we stop destroying their habitat. Finnish company Sugar Daddies Co spreads the word of the plight of our pollinators in delicious – and smile-provoking – ways. Buzz is building for the Daddies. For passionate surfers, it’s all about the waves: how to find them, catch them – and keep them.   partners  ,  ,   and   found themselves wondering how to create a surf wax that’s as ocean-friendly as possible, to ensure their beloved hobby doesn’t harm the waters. “Many of the existing waxes are made of paraffin, petrol or raw oil, and none of them are good alternatives for the environment,” Rinta explains. “We did a bit of research, and it turned out that beeswax could work.” Soon, a few colonies of the black-and-yellow fellows moved in to live at the founders’ farm in Isokyrö, Finland. The goal was to create an excellent cold-water surf wax – which did work out. Now, Sugar Daddies is one of the biggest, if not the number one, surf wax producer in the Nordics, with primary markets where the waves are chilly, such as Norway, Ireland, Scotland and Canada. However, that’s nowhere near where the story ends. As half of the four-strong team are farmers, they could spot the difference in their crop after the arrival of the bees. “All plants just seemed to be much healthier, happier and tastier. That’s when it hit us: we should make honey.” Currently, the Daddies have an unruly gang to guide: 20 million female bees. Come summer, the boy bees will be back, and the team will be even larger. Naked Honey is made without blending, heating, stirring or filtering. Sugar Daddies Co produces – or their bees do – different types of honey, all of which vary in taste and structure. Naked Honey, as they call it, comes from the DIY wooden homes built by the Daddies, and there’s no blending, heating, stirring or filtering. As the owners say: it’s closest you can get to enjoying honey straight from the combs. “Straight from the combs” also means that all jars can be tracked to an individual nest. Although Rinta and his partners haven’t taken the time to name all the over 20 million bees ( ), all queen bees have names, which will be printed on the labels in the future. The jars are sent out to stores around Finland, with Germany, Norway and the rest of Europe in the pipeline and North America looking promising. The firm also sells Summerbuzzes to companies and people alike, meaning that for a season, one hive is dedicated to you or your firm. Businesses getting their share of the buzz can also come visit and meet the hard-working insects and hear stories about them from the Daddies. Spreading information with detailed labels and visitor tours is part of the company’s social responsibility efforts – and one of the reasons for its existence. Rinta points out that despite the publicity received by the issue globally, not everyone is aware of the huge impact of bees and pollinators on the entire ecosystem. Understanding how our choices can affect their livelihood – and therefore ours, too – can help people to make informed decision as they go about their daily lives. These Daddies have good reason to smile. “Bees’ work is so invisible that it can be easy to ignore,” Rinta notes. “But even in their invisibility, they’re of massive importance to us and the planet.” Sugar Daddies Co has launched its own slogan, ‘Taking care of the little ones’, which can be extended to mean various other things as well. Every year, the company donates to a project that is for the benefit of the small, be it a children’s charity or a Movember campaign. But it’s not all sugar and spice and everything nice; running a bee business is hard work, too, particularly when you’ve got a farm to run, children to look after and cold waves to catch on the side. One of the time-consuming projects is the development of a product similar to manuka honey, which Rinta believes will gather momentum once launched. However, the bees are never a chore. If anything, they share a part of the workload. “Next summer, we’ve got a watermelon field coming up,” Rinta reveals. “It’ll be interesting to see how having our millions of home pollinators will affect the quality and taste.” The taste of summer and a healthy planet, that is. The “little ones”, aka bees, are the stars of the Sugar Daddies Co show."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/karate-kicks-kone-ketonen-s-forestry-business-into-high-gear/,Karate kicks Kone-Ketonen’s forestry business into high gear,"Innovation may have disrupted the forest industry, but it is also how Kone-Ketonen has remained successful through its ups and downs over three decades in operation. Now the Finnish family-run business is expanding internationally with the world’s first hydraulic hybrid harvester head.  is promoting a video on its Facebook page. Deep inside a Japanese forest, an excavator is cutting, delimbing and moving trees with impressive accuracy. The excavator is equipped with a Keto 100 Karate harvester head, and for Kone-Ketonen it represents a significant breakthrough. “We have developed a hydraulic hybrid system for the Karate which allows big harvester heads to be used with smaller, less powerful base machines,” explains  , sales manager at Kone-Ketonen. “This is especially suitable for areas with steep hills and narrow passageways, where forest workers can now use larger harvester heads than before.” This is particularly good news for small logging companies. Attaching a large harvester head to a tractor or excavator means they can do the work of a heavy-duty forest machine without investing in one. Karate products are currently being tested by a handful of Kone-Ketonen’s customers in Estonia, Finland and Japan, and full production is expected to start later this year. “Our track feed system is what makes our harvesters heads unique. It provides high measuring accuracy and feeding force but doesn’t cause surficial damage to tree trunks,” says Jari Hakala (right). Karate’s hydraulic system is just the latest in a succession of industry firsts for Kone-Ketonen. In fact, the company was founded on one over 30 years ago. As an engineering student in the late 1970s, company founder and CEO   developed a track feed system to gently move trees through a harvester head. He founded Kone-Ketonen in 1984 to commercialise this innovation. “Our track feed drive handles trees gently and doesn’t cause superficial damage. In addition, its measuring accuracy and feeding force are in a class of their own,” says Hakala. “Many others tried to use a track feed drive in the 1980s, but our patented mechanical structure makes it more durable than others.” The drive system became a vital selling point. In its early days, Kone-Ketonen employed only two people (and its founder’s wife), but its products quickly gained international interest. First came sales to neighbouring Sweden, then the UK, with Central Europe, Japan and North America following in the early 1990s. At this time, Kone-Ketonen expanded its product portfolio by introducing one of the world’s largest harvester heads in 1993. Today Kone-Ketonen’s patented track feed system is used in all of the company’s harvester heads, which weigh between 300 and 3 300 kilos. Around 90 per cent are sold abroad, most notably to Japan. “Japan is our biggest market today. Our track feed drive is very powerful and works well with excavators which are common in forestry use in Japan,” Hakala explains. “We have also designed a few specific products for that market.” Despite its expansion, Kone-Ketonen remains loyal to its origins. Still located in Kristiinankaupunki, a small city in Western Finland, the company now employs 30 people and brings in subcontractors when production boosts are needed. And they will be needed soon. In addition to its new Karate products, Kone-Ketonen has introduced its largest ever harvester heads in North America and secured its first deals in South America. The company is also investing in Russia and Eastern Europe. But Hakala has further reasons for enthusiasm. Having experienced the highs and lows of the forestry industry, the future currently seems bright. “At one point the forestry machinery industry meant almost nothing to people. But now that forests and forestry are on the rise again in Finland, they have rekindled interest in young people. And that feels good,” he concludes. The company has also been making an impact in Brazil."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/frameright-focuses-on-the-right-angle/,Frameright focuses on the right angle,"We’ve all seen failed automatic photo crops: heads left out, just legs, or simply bad composition. Finnish company Frameright was born out of the urge to give photos the shape they deserve. A few years ago, then-photography student   was a tiny bit annoyed every day. Press photographers took excellent photos, but the way they could be seen online didn’t do them justice. Automatic cropping destroyed the composition, and a thumbnail of a great photograph often destroyed the point of the picture completely. “It felt like all rules of visual journalism were broken at once,” Ekroos recalls. She mentioned her concern to her friend, IT consultant  . He pointed out that the automatic tools of publishing systems are very inflexible, so even if publishers wanted to customise their imagery, it would often be impossible. Keeping busy with her studies, Ekroos was certain someone else was just as frustrated as she was and a solution was in the making somewhere. But after over a year had passed since their first conversation, nothing had still happened. Järstä and Ekroos decided it was time for a change. They pitched the idea to Uutisraivaaja Media Innovation Challenge by the Helsingin Sanomat Foundation in 2017 – and won. “At that point, we both had careers and other things going on,” Ekroos explains. “However, winning the challenge validated our idea and proved we had a point. We dropped everything else and decided to focus on  .” The browser-based app can be easily integrated into different publishing systems. Frameright’s aim is to help publishing houses and online retailers display their imagery properly with a browser-based application. The app can be integrated into content and digital asset management systems, and it ensures that the publisher always knows what their content will look like on different platforms. Soon after the win in Finland, Ekroos and Järstä found an accelerator programme in Hamburg, Germany. At the moment, they’re developing the product further, with both Finnish and European clients on board and a funding round coming up. Later, the team plans to hit further markets, too, as the solution is easily scalable and suits various purposes. Ekroos notes that as there are billions of photographs published online every day, companies need all the help they can get to stand out from the visual noise. “For example, both in e-commerce and media, you won’t attract customers and viewers if your images look unattractive,” she says. “Frameright brings the flexibility that enables making photography responsive in different image sizes and platforms.” Ekroos describes this as new kind of control. “We refer to Frameright as non-destructive. It’s possible to create a new version of the photo on the go, and, although artificial intelligence will help in cropping the image sensibly, a human hand always has the last word. It’s a hybrid of technology and human control.” As automatic cropping has led to a wild wild west of visual online publishing, Ekroos is saddened how people have grown numb to bad-looking photography. She also emphasises that photography is not just showing what is being talked about; it’s also about composition and dynamics, the story and the ‘feel’ of the photograph. The same applies to writing; Ekroos thinks that having an inflexible photo publishing system is like having a text editor that prohibits the writer from spelling correctly. “If someone writes inconsistently or unclearly, that simply isn’t okay.” With Frameright, she wants to push for better visual content and journalism, the ultimate goal being to see Frameright being a part of all images that are published digitally. By training, Ekroos is still a photographer. Isn’t she at all annoyed that instead of taking incredible shots herself, she focuses on making those of others look better? “Not at all, never,” she responds laughingly. “What drove me to photography was a passion for visual culture. If this is the way I can have an impact on it, I’m happy to do it for others.” Tha ultimate goal being to see Frameright being a part of all images that are published digitally."

There is so much going on in Finnish education that we are already on our fourth collection of education-related activities. Check out what this quintet is up to. This Finnish company has announced a partnership with the New English School in Amman, Jordan. The school joins  ’s growing international customer base, to which it provides high-end and well-established education services. “We see ourselves as pioneers of renewing how education is seen globally,”    , founder and CEO. “Whether it is at the most remote location, lively city or sometimes even a conflict area, we want to ensure all children are being offered the best available education – from early childhood to graduation.” Finns don’t always understand how good they have it when it comes to education. FinlandWay wants to share the recipe with the rest of the world with the aim of helping families and children at the stage when learning skills and motivation are developed. “The values of sustainable development, equality, wellbeing and solidarity are something we’re proud to be spreading through FinlandWay,”  . “[W]e genuinely want to create better beginnings for children and families around the world.” Finland is world-renowned for its education system and doesn’t fare poorly in winter sports either. Now the two have come together in a unique range of education export products which are proving popular in China. The Chinese government has an ambitious goal. It wants to create 300 million new winter sports enthusiasts by the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. For Finns – who consider skiing, skating and general frolicking in the snow as national pastimes – this has opened the door to a new kind of educational export. This is all part of the  . Lohja-based Kisakallio Sports Institute has been one of the first to seize this opportunity “We have over 70 years’ experience in sports education and teaching sports skills,” says  , Kiskallio’s marketing director. “Now we want to teach Olympic winter sports to the Chinese and help them to understand the possibilities in combining education with sports.” International Minifiddlers, a programme launched by Helsinki-based  , could make violin teaching a reality in primary schools and after-school clubs. The teaching uses the Colourstrings method, an approach which is based on the philosophy of  and has been tested and refined over four decades in Finland. The method is ingenious in how it divides violin technique and music theory into distinct elements and introduces them to learners in the optimal order, in a way that makes use of colours and images. “The method and materials have brought us much closer to being able to bring violin instruction to primary schools and after-school clubs, to reaching as wide an audience as possible,”   a professional violinist and the founder and chief executive of Caprice.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/superpark-spreads-the-joy-of-movement-worldwide/,SuperPark spreads the joy of movement worldwide,"This Finnish company’s chain of indoor activity parks, designed for people of all ages, is now quickly expanding to new markets. The first SuperPark outside Finland was launched in Hong Kong in 2017, followed by Sweden, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Children and teenagers may spend a lot of their time in virtual worlds these days, but  ’s success shows that there is still a demand for fun physical spaces. The Finnish company has built a series of indoor activity parks that allow people of all fitness levels and ages to enjoy various activities, ranging from skateboarding to pedal car racing, and from zip wires to trampolines. Whatever the activity, the idea is to maintain a playful spirit. “We want our clients to have fun while doing physical activities together. They also get exercise of course, but exercise is almost a side product,” says  , country manager at SuperPark. A large part of the activities on offer are aimed at children and teenagers, but the parks are designed in a way that lets also adults join in on the fun. In fact, Sutinen says that from the start the goal was to create a place for both grown-ups and children. The first SuperPark was created at ski resort Vuokatti in Sotkamo in 2012. Initially built as a one-off activity centre, the park proved such a success that soon other parks were built around Finland. Currently, there are 13 SuperParks in the country. Lately, the company has turned its attention to other countries, with Asia being a particular focus region. The first SuperPark outside Finland was launched in Hong Kong in 2017, and during 2018 the company opened parks in Uppsala in Sweden, Suzhou in China, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. And in early spring, a new SuperPark will be opened in Shanghai, China. Sutinen says that these cities are fitting locations for activity parks since few people have gardens and there are limited opportunities for outdoor activities. SuperPark lessens the time that children and teenagers spend on their smartphones. Moreover, parents around the world are increasingly aware that exercise and improved motor skills help children to learn and do better at school. SuperPark also benefits from the growing concern that children and teenagers spend too much time on their smartphones. “I’m sure that many parents want to offer their children a fun experience that doesn’t involve screens,” Sutinen says. The company’s growth has already been fast (in 2013 it had a staff of 20; currently it employs 600 people), but during the next few years the firm aims to take a major leap: “Our goal is to have 100 parks around the world by 2023,” Sutinen says. He believes that the key enabler of this growth is the mindset that underlies everything the company does: SuperPark simply wants to provide experiences that stand out from its customers’ everyday life. “We design our parks and services so that a visit to a SuperPark is always a truly memorable experience,” he says. “Building a physical environment itself is easy, but it’s only the first step.” Part of the company’s brand is also its savvy with digital platforms: SuperPark’s Instagram account is one of the most popular company accounts in Finland, featuring an especially popular weekly live broadcast. The firm is also exploring new digital tools that would let customers save and share sport results, photos and videos from their visits. But wouldn’t this risk clashing with the idea of providing a fun no-screen experience? “The digital world is already a natural part of people’s lives, especially with teenagers,” Sutinen says. “There’s no point in resisting it, but it’s better to use it if it can help to motivate people to exercise.” The sky’s the limit. Exercise and improved motor skills help children learn and do better at school."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/verso-design-makes-beauty-functional/,Verso Design makes beauty functional,"This Finnish family company produces household items that make everyday life easier and prettier – so, overall, happier – whilst making them all long-lasting in terms of style, quality and sustainability.  When   was founded in late 1997 by mother and daughter   and  , sustainability was nowhere near the buzzword it is now. “It has really been remarkable how much things have changed in the past years and how much more aware consumers are these days,” says  , Sillanpää’s sister and a core member of the Verso team since the very beginning. “People really pay much more attention.” Sustainability is not just a buzzword for Verso Design. However, Verso’s interior design and home furnishing products aren’t made sustainably and as locally as possible because it’s trendy. Burman emphasises that the owners have always thought that if they do what feels right and good, others will feel it too. “Now we can see how beneficial it can be, but it was never something we did just for profit.” Verso Design wants to make products that last in every respect, ranging from production to style and quality. The materials are mainly of natural origin, and the idea is to combine classic Nordic traditions and contemporary design. “You could say we take a traditional material, such as felt, and just create something new out of it. Similarly, our woven birch baskets are updated versions of something really old and familiar.” Over 20 years after its birth, Verso Design launches new products twice a year, its collection including items like lifestyle and kitchen products, rugs and scarves. Originally it all started with just one thing: Savonen and Sillanpää won a wood innovation award with a rug made of wood and linen. With the prize money, they decided to commercialise their innovation. Verso Design is strongly a family company, founded by a mother-daughter duo and more family members joining later. From left: Tuttu Sillanpää, Tuuli Burman and Kirsikka Savonen. “My mother was an interior architect and furniture designer, and my sister was a textile artist and a designer as well,” Burman explains. “I was still in my teens when the company was founded, but pretty soon I jumped on board.” Whatever type of product the designers are working on, one thing is not compromised: the products need to be both functional and beautiful. Burman says that Verso doesn’t make mere decorations; instead, all items serve a purpose. The firm’s slogan is, tellingly, “functional beauty inspired by life”. By life, Burman says, Verso means pretty much everything everywhere. The aim is to look around oneself and see many, including tiny and perhaps surprising things. “We want our products to make everyday life easier, prettier and more pleasant.” From the word go, it was clear that Verso would head outside the borders of its home country. Burman notes that the market for relatively pricey design products is quite limited in a country the size of Finland. The first international steps were taken in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and slowly but surely the number of both markets and products has grown. Recently, wood has taken a more visible role in the company’s collections, which Burman attributes to her husband’s presence in the company – as he happens to be a carpenter. Currently, Verso Design’s biggest fan base can be found in Japan, and the company has partners here and there, including the US and various European countries. One new and intriguing market is South Korea, where marketing efforts are underway. New plans are brewing all the time, be it looking for new markets or coming up with new materials or products. Just as we speak, the family team complemented by other designers are creating ideas for the coming autumn. “There’s always plenty of ideas, but we’ll need to choose the ones to go forward with all the way to an actual product. That’s always a long road!” Japan is the company’s largest market, with partners in the US and various European countries."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/it-s-all-in-the-sauce-for-javla-sas-bolag/,It’s all in the sauce for Jävla Sås Bolag,"How many ingredients does it take to make excellent ketchup? Kaius Gestranius set out to discover for himself. The end result: not one too many. “What is this nonsense?”   found himself thinking whilst bartending in Helsinkian restaurants a fair few years ago. He witnessed many ready-made ingredients and felt that the food was just heated up, not actually cooked, and that the sauces came from bottles, not pots. Kaius Gestranius got a name for his company from his wife – who’s since then changed her tone when talking about the ‘damn sauces’. “I couldn’t help but think they didn’t really know what they’re doing in the kitchen,” he recalls. From a very young age, Gestranius has been working in restaurants both in and out of the kitchen, and he was used to seeing sauces made from scratch. “That’s when I learnt what real and classic cooking and sauce-making skills entail,” he notes. “For example, in one of the restaurants I worked for in my teens, there was a huge pot bubbling in the back kitchen with vegetables and bones in it.” However, things didn’t instantly get saucy for the young food idealist. It was only six summers ago that Gestranius, now a Lappeenranta resident, bought an American-style smoker to do some real barbecuing. He grabbed a bottle of BBQ sauce from the local supermarket and only glanced through the list of ingredients at home. Looking at the list of E numbers, the memories from the bar kitchens of the capital came flooding back. “What if,” Gestranius found himself wondering, “I just do it myself?” Jävla Sås Bolag’s Christmassy-flavoured sauce is named after the man himself: Santa. Initially, Gestranius made sauces for his family and friends – who happen to make up a large gang of people. His cooking got so popular that others started to ask him to make sauces for weddings, parties and other occasions. Soon, Gestranius took a study leave and, whilst at school, he founded  . The Swedish name, meaning ‘damn sauce company’, was accidentally invented by the founder’s wife. “She was fed up with the sauce bottles around our house and called them ‘damn sauces’,” Gestranius explains, “and a while later she asked me if I really think it’s possible to make a living with ‘these damn sauces’. I figured that if they’ve been called that twice, that must be their name.” The idea of the sauces is to give way to natural flavours and add absolutely nothing extra. Gestranius says he wants the sauces to boost the taste of the thing they accompany, such as a steak, instead of hiding it. “There are so many things one can do with just the core ingredients, so that there’s really no need to add stuff just for texture or colour. For example, our ketchup includes five ingredients.” With Jävla Sås Bolag poised for global sales success, it raises the question: are we in the midst of a saucy movement from Finland? A tidal wave of taste, perhaps?   late last year for its BBQ sauce,  , bringing with it a range of condiments, and numerous online Finnish stores ensure staples such as   are accompanying dishes around the globe. The ‘damn sauces’ have also taken Gestranius on television. He took part in the Finnish version of   – and walked out with much more money and shareholders he could ever have expected. Although the publicity was great, the eight months between filming and broadcasting were lengthy, as Gestranius had to keep quiet about the entire thing. Now, things are running full steam (or sauce), with the help of the advisors who jumped on board from the show. At the moment, Jävla Sås Bolag products are available in various Finnish supermarkets, and the company supplies its sauces to professional kitchens as well. Gestranius is also interested in other B2B collaborations, as the bottles have proven to be a great business gift. With a Swedish name on the side of a Nordic design bottle, Gestranius believes that Scandinavia is another fruitful market for ‘jävla’ sauces, and some investors are already developing contacts in the neighbouring regions. Those seeking to please their taste buds with the sauces sooner can do so by popping into the company’s webshop. Some have already done so: “I received an email from a German man who stumbled across our sauces whilst visiting Finland and who was disappointed because he couldn’t find them in all stores around the country,” Gestranius tells. “He couldn’t believe that something that good wasn’t all over the place!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-solutions-with-water/,Five for Friday: Solutions with water,"Whether it’s bottling, purifying, filtering, monitoring or capturing energy, Finnish companies have a taste for water-related innovations. Finland – the land of a thousand lakes. Well, actually, it’s something more like 188 000 lakes, if you are really counting. Add to this some 1 250 kms of coastline and perhaps it’s no surprise that Finns have come up with numerous solutions for a range of watery challenges. Finland has been recognised for having the world’s best drinking water. This local company has bottled it and is taking it to the world. Just last week, it made headlines for being named the official water of the star-studded Super Saturday event on the night before the Super Bowl. “Even though we already have experience from F1 VIP parties, the NFL final’s Super Saturday is our all-time dream event,”  , the company behind the brand. “It’s also great to see that the more important the celebration, the more global attention is placed on the water offered there.” This Finnish company teamed up with World Vision to launch a new solar-powered solution in Kenya that provides the local community with 8 000 litres of drinking water per day from a borehole. The solution is based on an innovative solar-powered reverse osmosis system that can produce pure water without any chemicals or emissions from fresh and saline water alike. “Reverse osmosis typically requires much energy. Solar Water Solutions comes in to provide a technological solution to solve this energy challenge,”  . “Our solution makes it possible to supply safe water to people living in remote areas without electricity coverage.” The ever-active researchers at VTT want to save the nutrients and carbon in municipal sewage and some industrial waste waters. VTT has designed a resource container concept based on physico-chemical methods that are used or under development in the industrial sector. “The focus of substance extraction will be specifically on the products, such as nutrients, biocarbon and clean water, instead of on their disposal,”  . “The operating model does not include biological treatment, so it can be flexibly implemented.” When Finnish heating, cooling, plumbing and infrastructure solutions provider Uponor teamed up with American company Belkin International to establish Phyn, the result was intelligent. The Phyn Plus water monitoring system alerts homeowners of changes in normal water usage via a mobile app. “Phyn’s intelligent water solution, Phyn Plus, is a great addition to Uponor’s product offering and fully in line with our strategic goals in terms of digitalisation and sustainability,”  , president and CEO of Uponor. “Phyn Plus protects house owners from leaks, conserves water and enhances our way of using water.” Apart from the abundance of lakes, the Finnish coastline is also 1 200 kilometres in length. This local company has thus turned its attention to waves in order to generate electricity. Largely unexplored until recently, the wave energy field is valued at over 74 billion euros. Wello’s Penguin Wave Energy Converter is at the forefront of the push to harness the power of the sea. “Wello’s team and financers have spent a vast amount of effort during the previous 10 years to develop this extraordinary technology,”  , after the company inked an agreement to introduce its wave energy converters to the Chinese market. “Now we are in a position to harvest the results: there are new inquiries and contracts coming in and we really are on the verge of conquering the world with Penguins.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-mobility-training-stick-woos-nba-and-nhl/,Finnish mobility training stick woos NBA and NHL,"Bye-bye back pain and stiff necks. Finnish sports technology company TE3 has transformed the old faithful exercise stick, using data and artificial intelligence, into a personal mobility trainer.   Looks can be deceiving. From the outside, the TE3 Mobility Training Stick looks like any other exercise stick: lean, long and cylindrical. But inside, it holds an array of sensors and technology capable of analysing mobility and movement in real time.  , the startup behind the smart stick, believes this data is crucial in helping to cure issues caused by our increasingly sedentary lifestyles. A very Finnish beginning: a chat in a sauna led Ari Laakkonen (left) and Jarkko Kortelainen to develop a digital exercise stick for improving mobility. “We use our bodies so little nowadays that we no longer understand how to properly control their positions and movements,” says  , CEO at TE3. “This has slowly resulted in muscle tensions, mobility imbalances and limitations in range of motion. These, in turn, lead to pain, stress and sleeplessness because the body can never completely relax.” The TE3 stick digs down to the root of these problems. Used both in training and rehabilitation, the stick gives instant feedback by vibrating if an exercise isn’t performed correctly. This highlights in a concrete way any issues with how a user’s body moves. An accompanying mobile app guides the user through the results and offers tailored exercises for improving mobility, coordination and body control. TE3 wouldn’t be a Finnish innovation if sauna wasn’t part of its story. In 2014 Laakkonen sat in a sauna with his friend, sports coach  , and talked about developing wellbeing equipment together. “Jarkko immediately pointed at the broom handle in the corner and said, ‘if you can embed technology into that handle that can tell the angle of the broom, we are getting somewhere,’” Kortelainen recalls. “We decided that evening to incorporate sensors into an exercise stick which will warn if the stick starts to lean or rotate the wrong way.” The duo developed their idea with the assistance of coaches, physiotherapists and doctors. Some market research showed the duo were onto something new. Exercise sticks have been used in sports for decades, but not for sensor-based testing. Laakkonen and Kortelainen started to talk with coaches, physiotherapists and doctors to develop their idea further, and TE3 was founded in 2016. Several prototypes and demos later, the startup launched two versions of its mobility stick in early 2018 – one targeted at consumers and one for professional use. “Mobility is already a trend, but there hasn’t been a measuring device for it that can be used anywhere,” Laakkonen says. “Physiotherapists and other professionals can use our stick for more detailed measurements, while home users can test themselves, get advice on what to do and follow their progress.” Sports professionals have been quick to see the stick’s appeal. It has already been adopted by physiotherapists, athletes and coaches in Finland. Now, TE3 is testing the waters across the pond with three NHL and NBA teams. “I can’t name the teams yet, but we are developing testing and training protocols for athletes with them,” Laakkonen explains. “The consumer market is our ultimate goal but working with professionals gives us credibility.” Another focus for TE3 is internationalisation. In addition to Scandinavia, the company is looking at Germany, Singapore and California in the US, and has just signed its first reseller in South Korea. A Japanese deal will follow soon. “We have an ambitious goal for 2019: to have over 10 resellers in more than five countries,” Laakkonen enthuses. TE3 is also in the midst of patenting its smart mobility stick. But this isn’t because it is afraid of competition. The startup is confident it is not only its technology, but also the concepts and knowledge the company is building around the technology that set it apart. In the end, what matters most to TE3 is motivating people to move and take care of their bodies. “I would like to see us become a trailblazer in improving general knowledge about mobility and movement control,” Laakkonen says. “Our smart stick offers data but also a concrete experience in where a user’s mobility issues lie. This, hopefully, motivates people to make changes.” “Measuring shouldn’t be done for measurements’ sake, you always need to have a goal in mind,” Laakkonen explains. “Our smart stick measures mobility but it also lets you know what your mobility imbalances and limitations are and what kind of exercises you can do to improve them.”"

Finland’s biggest hub, Helsinki Airport, is growing. Just last week, it finalised  . Opening the 33 400 square metres of new terminal space is a significant step forward for the airport’s goal of serving 30 million passengers annually. It’s going to be needed, as tourism numbers across Finland are increasing exponentially. Helping to facilitate this growth is the increasing number of international airlines utilising the Finnish hub. And, with a minimum transit time of 35 minutes in place at the airport, fast connections mean all corners of the country are easily accessible. Check it out: Serbian national carrier Air Serbia is commencing a thrice-weekly service between Belgrade and Helsinki in June. Along with linking the two cities, the route “also provides a seamless onward connection through Belgrade to major destinations in Southeast Europe [and] the Mediterranean,”  , CEO of Air Serbia. Tibet Airlines will introduce a new direct flight route between Jinan, China, and Helsinki Airport on 8 April. “The new Tibet Airlines’ route between Jinan and Finland reinforces Helsinki Airport’s position as a significant hub for travel to Asia,”  . “It directly connects the Shandong province and Finland, and we warmly welcome Tibet Airlines here at Helsinki Airport.” Chinese airline Juneyao Air will make its move into European markets by opening a direct flight from Shanghai to Helsinki in summer 2019. “In 2018, over 550 000 passengers travelled between China and Finland,”  . “Chinese cities were the second most popular long-distance destinations after Japan.” Germany is the most popular market for Helsinki Airport, and therefore it came as no surprise when this low-cost airline opened a route to Berlin from Helsinki in March last year. “We are delighted to launch our first flights between Helsinki and Berlin Tegel, connecting passengers between Germany and Finland for the very first time and expanding easyJet’s Nordic network,”  , a country manager at easyJet. More recently, the airline also launched   to the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi. In 2018, Dubai-based carrier flydubai became the first UAE-based airline to operate direct flights to Finland, with a year-round service from Dubai International. “We are thrilled for this route opening and looking forward to our co-operation with flydubai,”  , account manager for Asia and Middle East at  . “Last year registered overnights from [the] UAE increased by 30 per cent in Finland and we are hoping to break the record in 2018.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tauko-wraps-you-in-ideology/,TAUKO wraps you in ideology,"For Finnish fashion house TAUKO, it all started out from an ideological desire to have a positive impact on the textile industry. Its recycled designs have found an audience among socially aware and other fashionistas. TAUKO is looking for new markets, particularly in regions that are fond of all things Nordic. The number of bed linen, tablecloths and other textiles in the hotels and restaurants of the world is immense; and they’re constantly used, washed, used again, and discarded.   and  , the co-founders of  , don’t want to see high-quality and well-kept fabrics being burnt en masse. “There’s a huge textile waste issue, but it’s not particularly talked about in the general consumer market,” Moisio explains. “Many textile companies are by default keen to co-operate, as for them it’s just as saddening to see vast amounts of good material dumped.” TAUKO’s mission is to design and produce womenswear that weaves together contemporary art, design and respect for sustainable values. Every year, it launches two collections made from local, discarded rental textiles and other raw materials such as surplus knits, yarns and organic wool. Most of the materials come from the textile partners of Finnish and German restaurants and hotels. Together with its collaborators, TAUKO is always looking for new methods to utilise recycled materials. The production itself takes place in Finland and Estonia. TAUKO was founded in 2008, initially as a side project, but it has slowly and organically grown into an international business. The concept created by Moisio and Rissanen is unique, at least on a commercial scale. However, neither of them has a background in fashion or textiles: they’ve both got degrees in art research. “The topic of my master’s thesis was Cuban poetry,” Moisio says laughingly. “So we’re self-taught in that respect, and in the beginning our contacts were mainly in art and theatre.” On the brink of graduation, the two friends were wondering what to do next. They had already sewn their own clothes and, as Moisio describes them, were both dyed-in-the-wool idealists. Mila Moisio (left) and Kaisa Rissanen have both grown up in families that encouraged a DIY attitude. “We share the same set of strong values, and TAUKO is based on our belief that running a business can have a more direct impact on our society and its structures than academic research. It’s all pretty political for us.” Actually, TAUKO wouldn’t exist to begin with if its founders didn’t think they could do business sustainably and use it for bettering the world. Moisio says the changes in consumer behaviour are inevitable, and big brands seem to be taking note of them, too. She believes that, in a few decades, sustainability won’t be a selling point but something that’s expected of everyone. Despite the omnipresence of the company’s core values, TAUKO doesn’t appeal only to socially and environmentally aware fashionistas. Moisio emphasises that the quality and originality of design are just as important. “Not all our clients really think about the ethical aspects, they’re more interested in our style. That’s no problem: we sell design, not recycled sheets.” Be it because of values or fashion, TAUKO has attracted customers in its core markets, Finland and German-speaking Europe. The reason the duo chose Germany as their base in continental Europe is that there’s pretty much an endless supply of raw materials that suit the company’s purposes. “Initially we were concerned that our production wasn’t scalable to international markets because we might run out of materials,” Moisio tells. “Finding partners abroad also helped us to realise the immense scale of the issue, as we understood how much textile is actually going to waste globally.” The word ‘ ’ means ‘a break’ in English. For Moisio, it was important to find a meaningful name for the company – bear in mind, she has written an entire thesis on poetry. “As a word,   is also handy. Unlike many Finnish words, it has no   or  letters, and it’s not that long or difficult to pronounce.” Sustainable values are at the core of TAUKO, from the fabrics chosen to production."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-polar-bear-pitching/,Five for Friday: Polar Bear Pitching,"A startup pitching competition held in a hole in the ice – it could only happen in the Finnish city of Oulu.  Oulu has made a name for itself as an innovative hub of great ideas and tech brilliance, as well as the focal point of rock-star posing, thanks to the annual  . This week saw the city hosting its second globally renowned event:  . Here, entrepreneurs had all the time in the world to pitch their startup idea. The only catch: they had to do so standing in an ice hole carved in the frozen Baltic Sea, while it was five degrees below zero. Missed our live stream?  . Here’s what we discovered during this year’s event. After a sunny day of semifinals, where dozens of hopeful startups from around the word filled the ice hole, the grand finale kicked off with one of the more memorable examples of Finnish   (a particular grit and perseverance found in people from this neck of the woods). Internationally renowned jazz pianist   was up to his neck in chilly water. The name of his brief keynote: “No pain, no gain!” In true Finnish style, he had few words to share before announcing he would be performing a concert in an hour or so in front of a live audience. “This is my warm-up for the concert,” he declared. Only in Finland… The winner of the event, Norway’s Bookis, impressed with their finesse, sense of humour, professionalism and “We love Oulu” underwear. The company’s e-commerce solution for books has also attracted attention, so too has the duo’s mantra: “Books should be read not stored.” Polar Bear Pitching is truly growing in reach. Bookis won the sister event held in the northern Norwegian town of Tromsø in January. And, following on from the Estonian firm  , the main event continues to attract international participants. Finns have a long history of stepping into the ice hole for recreation, with the experience certainly providing a refreshing ‘yin’ to the sweaty heat of the sauna’s ‘yang’. As for pitching from an ice hole, this is a more recent tradition. The event was founded in 2013, after   came up with the idea to push back against the downfall of Nokia that had left many in the area unemployed. “You know one interesting thing about Polar Bear Pitching?” asked co-host  . “The movement into the ice hole in order to pitch is an international trademark right now.” After each of the 12 finalists had dipped into the ice hole, it was  from Arctic China’s turn to give a keynote speech. His message was simple: set up shop in Finland. Tang underlined the ease of setting up a business and persevering here: “If you give Finns trust they give it back,” he stated. Also, it’s wise to get into the local mindset. “When you work with Finnish partners, think from their side,” Tang continued. “It’s a wealthy country with beliefs: [Finns] think of self-value instead of just making money. You have to believe in yourself!” Located 600 kilometres north of Helsinki, Oulu has found innovative ways to turn its geographical isolation into an advantage. Polar Bear Pitching and the Air Guitar World Championships are known around the world. Another eye-catching event here is the world’s northern-most Irish music festival.   and   from the   stepped into the chilly water to perform a gig, whilst the results of the pitching event were being tallied by the judging panel of international investors. “Happy St Patrick’s Day from Oulu, Finland,” Brent enthused."

Finnish startup Hoop has made them more durable, sustainable and city-friendly. The Hoop app enables people to find scooters in their area.  is on a mission. The   founder wants to reduce private motoring by offering zero-emission alternatives for short journeys. His first venture? Sustainable electric scooter sharing. The service, also called Hoop, is already available in Dubai and will launch soon on Jalava’s home turf of Helsinki. “Our e-scooters act as an extension of public transport and offer a fun, convenient and environmentally friendly way to move from one place to another,” he says. Hoop isn’t the first company to jump on the e-scooter market, but it knows how to stand out in two key ways. The first is avoiding the chaos of scooters being left everywhere. Like most rivals, Hoop does offer a dockless service, and the scooters are found and unlocked using the Hoop app. But to incentivise users to keep cities tidy, the company has created Hoop Stops. “Hoop Stops are physical parking areas confined by flags,” explains Jalava. “When a user leaves our scooter in one of these areas they get a cheaper journey. This way we can help keep cities clean and offer our service in places with the highest demand.” Hoop also believes it can stand out through environmental responsibility. According to  , the average lifespan of a shared scooter is just 28 days. This is because most scooter-share companies use vehicles designed for consumer use. “We wanted to create an environmentally friendly device with durability in a class of its own,” Jalava says. “Our scooter’s lifespan is around a year. When you can’t fix it anymore, it can be melted and reused as material. We don’t want to bring more waste into this world.” “Our goal is to radically reduce private motoring and make cities greener.” Despite its success and business model differentiators, Hoop is a relatively young company. Launched in the summer of 2018, the company was inspired by a visit Jalava paid to Santa Monica, the US, in 2017. His trip coincided with scooter sharing launching in the city. The dockless business model divided opinion and spurred Jalava to think about how to make it more sustainable. Hoop’s operations began when Jalava found like-minded co-founders in  ,   and  . By early March 2019, the service had launched in Dubai. Helsinki will follow in a month or two and additional cities in the Middle East and the Nordics later in 2019. But why couple Dubai and Helsinki? These two unlikely bedfellows have one surprising compatible business connection: climate. During the rough Nordic winters, Hoop can move its fleet to the Middle East then return them in the summer when demand in the Middle East drops due to extreme heat. “The other reason is the high barrier of market entry in the Middle East,” Jalava says. “We have done a lot of legwork there, and we are working closely with local authorities. We are the only company with a permit to operate in Dubai’s Silicon Oasis, and we have agreed terms with a local sponsor to support our expansion throughout the Middle East.” Hoop’s relationship building in the region has paid off. Dubai’s Silicon Oasis district has decided to build a bike and scooter route network across the whole city to support services like Hoop. And Jalava believes close working ties between cities and mobility companies is crucial. “Our goal is to radically reduce private motoring and make cities greener. E-scooters are only one solution,” Jalava concludes. “The world isn’t changed by anyone alone, but change requires many players and collaboration, and we want to foster that.” Hoop’s electric scooters launched in Dubai in early March. Helsinki will follow as the spring weather arrives in the Nordics."

You can’t always send a helicopter there, but with our solution you can connect to the vessel, see what’s happening and provide instructions.” Called POINTR, the solution stands out from the competition for two reasons: security and reliability, according to Krassi. “We have the best security solution,” he declared. “It used to be completely unthinkable to connect to a power plant through a remote video platform. But our solution has already been deployed at over 300 plants.” Japan, he added, is an appealing market for the technology firm not only because of its size and powerful machine building industry, but because of its standing as a gateway to the rest of Asia, too. Establishing a Japanese office together with a local partner is part of the internationalisation plans of Houston Inc., a Helsinki-based designer and provider of analytics-based digital services for industry heavyweights such as   and Rolls-Royce. “The functioning of a dockside crane – how it lifts, lowers and moves containers – is pure mathematics,” explained  , the CEO of Houston Inc. “You can use mathematical algorithms to make sure the crane doesn’t break down and bring the port’s operations to a standstill. That’s the kind of predictions we’re doing for, among others, Konecranes and the Port of Singapore.” “I’m not aware of a single other software company in the world with the same kind of knowhow from these kinds of industries,” he added. The Japanese automotive, consumer electronics and maritime industries are of particular interest for the service provider, even though it realises that the bureaucratic and hierarchical nature of the corporate culture can complicate the market entry. “But the market is huge and the potential enormous,” acknowledged Ruotimo. Japanese heavy industries have been pinpointed as a potential clientele also by Quuppa, a Finnish company providing positioning data by using a unique combination of angle-of-arrival signal processing and Bluetooth LE. The method is capable of achieving a positioning accuracy of 10 centimetres in real time, thus meeting the needs of applications ranging from military and security to production and logistics, and all the way to sports and entertainment. “The Japanese found us three years ago,” told  , the director of sales at Quuppa. “Roughly 20 companies are currently using our technology in their own products.” Quuppa, he stated, is the first positioning solutions provider in the world to not only take advantage of the technology, but also to boast an ecosystem of more than 130 partners, including system integrators, solutions providers and tag manufacturers. “One unique feature of our solution is that it neither disturbs, nor is disturbed by other wireless systems. This is important especially in environments like sports stadiums, exhibition halls and shopping centres with typically lots of wireless traffic,” said Rauhala. This Vaasa-based company has developed technology that it believes has the potential to shake up the long-stagnant radiation detection and measurement domain. Its scalable platform technology is capable of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, converting it to a digital format and analysing it for clients. “We protect people from radioactive radiation,” summarised  , the CEO of Sensinite. “We’re offering a genuinely new innovation. Our sensor element is 80 per cent thinner and 75 per cent lighter than existing alternatives. It’s a miniaturised element that’s suitable for all radiation measurements.” Based on decades of research and development work by  , a professor of experimental high-energy physics at the  , the technology has applications in domains such as border security and both industrial and medical radiographic testing. Karlsson believes Japan is an appropriate market for the product especially given the prevalence of drones, robots, wearables and other modern-day gadgets. This Finnish IT service provider is eager to inject a touch of wit into buildings in Japan with   Emphatic Building, an IoT platform that uses sensor data, system integration and data analytics to solve actual problems for both the managers and end-users of buildings. “Japan is an interesting market. The number of buildings alone is so enormous,” said  , the official voice of Tieto Emphatic Building. The platform effectively creates a digital twin of a building, she explained. The twin, then, enables employers to monitor how different areas of the workplace are used and how the usage affects air quality, congestions, noise levels and other factors related to employee wellbeing. Employees, meanwhile, are able to find the right colleague, collaborator and workspace for the task at hand, as well as to provide feedback and create service tickets. “It helps in the modern work environment by making various different ways of working possible,” summarised Savolainen. The application, she added, is dubbed as emphatic rather than smart specifically because of its human-centric design: “We want to serve the user inside the building,” she underscored."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sniffie-software-digs-out-the-best-price-for-everyone/,Sniffie Software digs out the best price for everyone,"Having a little computer in hand at all times enables consumers to compare prices without trekking from one store to another. Finnish company Sniffie Software ensures that companies know what their competitors are selling for.  knows what is the best way to save money: paying the optimal price for the product you need. A clever consumer will always compare prices before making a purchase decision – and with our always-connected mobiles, it’s easy and quick. Tomi Grönfors is leading the company to become the biggest in its field in a decade’s time. Thus, if retailers are unaware of the market price, they’ll lose revenue in a matter of clicks. “This has really made consumers kings in the market,” Grönfors explains. “People can walk into stores to see the product, check out other retailers online and get it from the one who sells it for the best price.” , co-founded by the now-CEO Grönfors, is set to disrupt the pricing methods of e-commerce and retail giants. Its cloud-based software-as-a-service collects up-to-date market pricing information, enabling companies to analyse and optimise their margins by repricing their products and sending new data to their own system. This, in Grönfors’ opinion, benefits both retailers and consumers. Retailers know how to price their products, where they can win and where they must toughen up, whereas consumers will be more likely to find their bargains. “Even if it doesn’t directly lower prices, it increases activity in the market. In that sense, Sniffie democratises retail.” Being cheaper than the rest is not the message Sniffie is aiming to spread. Grönfors explains that the software is designed to enable retailers to know where they stand and how they can stand taller than others. “A good example can be found in the hospitality industry,” he tells. “For instance, hotels sometimes have revenue managers that keep a keen eye on the market to get the best possible price, but the price can vary.” Sniffie is best suited for companies that operate in price-intensive industries and resell products that are sold also by their competitors. With Sniffie, the price can be adjusted instantly. The monthly service even helps to build a pricing strategy that can be used to analyse the data it collects. Grönfors says that Sniffie is best suited for companies that operate in price-intensive industries and resell products that are sold also by their competitors. The users include large corporations with in-depth in-house expertise in pricing, as well as small, independent e-commerce firms. “The principle is based on the immense growth of mobile buying. Wherever consumers go, they have access to real-time information about prices, so retailers need to act right away, too.” Grönfors also notes that as pricing information is so accessible to consumers, premium retailers need to find other ways to compete in the market, such as higher level of service or value-added services. Sniffie is used by big and small companies alike, locally and globally. Due to the growing mobile market, the competition has also hardened. Grönfors shares the story of one of the company’s advisors, who recently visited a shop to look for headphones. “At the store, he searched for the product online and spotted it on Amazon for 70 euros cheaper. For that price difference, he was willing to wait for the two-day delivery. It’s a burning problem for both retail and e-commerce to keep track of, as it has a direct impact on their revenue.” Evidently, Grönfors isn’t the only one believing in Sniffie. From the very beginning, there have been companies collaborating with the development of the service, and in January the team   for Google’s Accelerate your Growth Nordics programme. Currently, Sniffie has customers in the Nordics and Baltics, with ambitions to grow all over Europe. The team of about a dozen members is set to expand as well, as Sniffie wants to be present in local markets. The vision is far from modest: to be the most significant e-commerce revenue optimisation platform by 2027."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/culture-comes-first-for-svart-records/,Culture comes first for Svart Records,"Finland’s Svart Records is putting out music at a breathtaking pace in genres ranging from doom and death metal to free jazz and Americana. Vinyl lovers had it tough in the 1990s and early 2000s. Vinyl pressings were limited and quality questionable ever since the compact disc ushered in the first wave of the digital music revolution and record companies began to deliberately phase out vinyl in the 1980s. One of them was  , whose frustration with the lack of reasonably priced wax copies of alternative and underground music reached a tipping point in the late 2000s. “I was thinking about how I could get my hands on records. Spotify had made it easier to find an audience for music, but it was still difficult to get your hands on vinyl. The vinyl boom hadn’t yet started, and there was a lot of stuff – especially from the 1990s and 2000s – that was only available on CD,” he tells. Finnish psychedelic black metal outfit Oranssi Pazuzu has been Svart’s most significant global export. “We then got the idea that we should buy a couple of licences and start publishing ourselves.” The idea materialised into   in 2009. Pulkki and his co-founder   soon began to make a name for the independent record label by re-issuing sought-after albums from the deep chasms of the musical underground. “We managed to get some good licences before the vinyl boom started which put ourselves on the map,” recounts Pulkki. “The main impetus was that we had people around us whose bands hadn’t been published on vinyl. No one had the courage, so we decided to give it a go. At the time, we definitely had no grand dreams of it becoming a profession.” But it did. 
“Beastmilk’s Climax is an album I’ll be proud of in the retirement home. I’m glad we have it as proof of what can be achieved in Finland,” says Pulkki. 
“Reverend Bizarre are one of the most successful underground bands globally. Its first albums date back 20 years, making it part of the heavy metal tradition in Finland.” 
“It’s impossible to single out any album, because we’ve done so much with Eero Koivistoinen. But Odysseus is probably what you should look up first.” 
“We’ve already talked a lot about Oranssi Pazuzu, but they’re currently our number-one export product and in high demand abroad.” Svart Records has grown organically and steadily over the past 10 years, venturing into original releases, establishing its own booking agency and caving in under the pressure to publish also digitally. “For a long time we wanted to be the last label that doesn’t put out digital music, but that was pretty stupid of us,” says Pulkki. Svart Records has recorded a turnover of approximately 1.5 million euros in each of the past two years while generating a substantial share of its monthly sales – from 30 to 60 per cent, depending on the albums released that particular month – from overseas. “Our biggest release this spring will be Waste of Space Orchestra’s Syntheosis, a psychedelic metal opera by   and  . The first pressing alone will be around 4–5 000 copies, some 80 per cent of which will go abroad,” he tells. Also, the clientele has grown as the label has diversified its catalogue from the various subgenres of metal to free jazz, progressive rock, hip-hop and electronic music. Pulkki, who is in charge of artists and repertoire, says not restricting itself to any single genre is a core part of the philosophy of Svart Records. “There aren’t too many genres we don’t publish; maybe schlager and redneck country. Our trademark sound probably could be described as mild psychedelic confusion or space drone, as exemplified by Oranssi Pazuzu.” “We’ve kept the range wide on purpose, to discombobulate the audience,” he says dryly. That spirit of rebellion and nonconformity may be what has enabled the 10-year-old company to establish itself as one of the most recognisable and – with its roughly 50 releases a year – prolific independent record labels in the world. Svart is ready to give any genre a spin – as long as it’s not schlager or redneck country. “People often wonder about the number of releases, but you have to keep in mind that they’re all limited pressings, some as small as 300, with 500 being the standard. The scene is just so small that it isn’t worthwhile putting out bigger pressings,” reminds Pulkki. Svart Records, he adds, has received praise for not only catering to fans of obscure music with a preference for vinyl, but especially for its commitment to cultural documentation. “We’ve gotten praise for doing important cultural work, because it’s typically a lot of work putting together a release, hunting down old artists and asking for permission. Then you get to sell 400 copies of the record, making this more cultural work than business. But we’re striving for a business model where we create culture and make a living doing it,” he says. “Culture first is how we’ve been going about it.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-plant-based-innovations/,Five for Friday: Plant-based innovations,"Green walls, hydroponic plants, herbs, bottles and cholesterol-lowering foodstuffs – it has got to be plants from Finland. In Finland, life exists in harmony with nature. How can it not, with around 75 per cent of the land mass covered in forest? From this has grown an innovative approach to utilising plants in a number of industries. If stale air at the office has you climbing up the walls, this company has the solution – one that technically could be climbed as well. Naava’s intelligent green walls promote wellbeing, purify the air and can be used as space dividers. Earlier this year, the company teamed up with Office Blueprint to bring a breath of fresh air to London. “The London area suffers from bad air quality and companies are looking for solutions to create healthier spaces for their employees and clients to benefit from,” Naava’s  . “Naava is happy to help companies achieve that with the help of Office Blueprint, who has great clients which span a wide range of sectors, including finance, consulting, IT, hospitality, and education.” A handful of years ago, designer   was like many of us: a fan of cooking dreaming about growing fresh herbs in his home, especially during the barren chill of the Nordic winter. Whilst indoor gardens could be found abroad, they lacked a distinct Finnish touch. In short: they needed to be functional yet pleasing to the eye. His indoor hydroponic gardening solution now has customers across Europe and Asia. The company offers two different smart garden platforms, accessories such as growth-boosting light blocks and the seeds of more than 40 different plants. “Plantui is a young company, but our goal is growth, naturally,” the founding partner of Plantui  . Indeed. Even the most mundane of weeds can be used for delicious and healthy treats, and Helsinki Wildfoods wants the whole world to jump on the bandwagon with its blend of urban and natural flavours. “There’s so much free superfood everywhere, and people just don’t know it,”  . “So many plants are generally just considered weed, when in reality they make for tasty spices, sauces and all sorts of food.” The company has embarked on bringing flavours from the Nordic forest to kitchens around the world under the METTÄ label. “The METTÄ spice family combines the unique and rich flavours of the Nordic forest with a new, exciting twist,”  . Of course, a list of innovations would not be complete without the input of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. A couple of years ago, a VTT research team developed a method for the production of furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from plant sugars. “This in turn can be used to produce items such as drinking bottles, paints and industrial resins,”  . The method provides another route for the packaging and beverage industries to expand the use of renewable materials. Bottoms up! There’s no way around it: cholesterol is a killer. This company is tackling cholesterol problems with its range of Benecol solutions based on plant stanols, compounds that are found naturally in cereals, fruits and vegetables and are proven to lower cholesterol. In 2015, the company   to introduce yogurt drinks to the market. Later that year, the company entered the Chinese market with its powdered drink. “Cholesterol levels are rising in China, so there is a need for cholesterol-lowering products,”  , sales director of Raisio’s Benecol business."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-a-first-responder-in-the-global-critical-comms-industry/,Finland is a first responder in the global critical comms industry,"Public safety authorities make daily life-or-death decisions in emergency situations and other incidents. How do you ensure efficient co-operation between the police, fire brigade and emergency medical team in an environment where time is of the very essence? The Finnish critical comms ecosystem has been ranked a top performer in the field and has an end-to-end proposal and some time-tested references to show for it. If you lived in 1960s rural Finland and found yourself in an emergency, say a fire, chances are the only emergency number you had was the local fire chief’s home number. The only realistic option was to pull on your Nokia-made rubber boots, one of the company’s main products at the time, and grab the nearest hose. While Nokia ventured off into military and commercial mobile radios, Finnish public safety authorities invested in their own separate regional analogue networks to communicate more efficiently among themselves. By the 1980s, there were over 50 different and out-of-sync networks that had played their part for a while but were fast becoming expensive to maintain and inefficient to use in emergency situations. Coinciding with Nokia’s dramatic rise to become the world’s biggest mobile phone manufacturer, the 1990s saw Finnish authorities pulling together to develop a unified and centralised digital public safety communications network. “One of the main reasons for a unified system was a lack of resources,” says  chairperson at TCCA’s  . “It wasn’t possible to build five, four, three or even two digital networks for each branch of public safety. So, Finnish authorities had to overcome the mental hurdle of trusting each other and develop a common operating model.” From voice and short data transmissions to actionable wide bandwidth data, emergency services are capitalising on new technologies to improve their situational awareness. By pooling and sharing, and overcoming departmental preconceptions, Finland became the first to establish a nationwide public safety network, Virve, in 2002. It is still one of only few such networks in the world, and it serves all public safety authorities, rail transport and selected utility companies. The network covers over 100 000 users and around 40 000 terminals through 1 400 base stations across Finland. This means that all Finnish public safety officials now have access to the same network whether they’re with the police, fire brigade, emergency medical team, armed forces or other critical infrastructure. When an accident occurs, the first responders from the multiple branches of public safety are grouped according to the nature of the accident and are able to communicate with one another. Operating under the same system of communications saves time and improves situational awareness, resulting in more efficient decision-making and fewer lives lost. “Due to inter-cooperation between critical communications users and industry, we have good process of continuous development and with that the expertise to also help other nations with what needs to be thought of on the regulative and societal side, as well as on the technical side,” explains Pesonen. Building on the multiagency co-operation in the 1990s,   (CCF) is a network through which the Finnish critical communications sector has continued to develop critical communications. The vibrant ecosystem now spans dozens of companies, authorities and research labs. From the consortium, one can find actors in all stages of the critical communications value chain, including leading Finnish companies like   and  . “When you work together, you find ways of co-operating and begin to trust others. It creates a positive spiral where co-operation breeds trust, giving birth to innovation and more co-operation.” “On the technology side, the Finnish ecosystem is nearly able to supply an end-to-end solution,” says Pesonen. “The societal part is trickier and more dependent on the client, but we do have a world-first reference in building such a multiagency approach right here at home.” The approach has not gone unnoticed internationally. Finland was ranked as the top-performing nation in critical comms in a   by Quixoticity in 2017. The lessons learnt are being perfected for a more complex and data-laden future in LTE/5G networks. In addition, the roll-outs of commercial 5G networks will eventually start broadening the concept of critical communications into novel areas. “Previously, public authorities were quite limited by technology and our operating models had to be adjusted according to the available technology. Now we’re limited by culture. With technology, we can do more than what is currently comprehensible and what the regulative frameworks allow.” Finnish authorities are currently developing Virve 2.0 for a planned launch in 2022–2023 to support LTE/5G connectivity for public safety actors. The current system will be operated in parallel with the broadband system to ensure operational capability, until being phased out from 2025 onwards. The broadband mobile service will enable new functions for authorities with which to further enhance their situational awareness. When moving from voice to data, the amount of information at hand will require new analytical skills from the emergency personnel. How do you make sure the people are in sync with the tech? Finland has a proven track record of structured multiagency co-operation in critical communications. Finnish critical communications company   came to being when a public organisation asked a couple of young IT guys to help them with implementing the Virve 1.0 system in 2002. The company has been in the business of providing simulator-based training and planning tools for operative communications ever since and has grown into a global business, with clients in 28 countries. “We’re a software company most of all,” states  , CEO of Beaconsim. “We offer our clients their existing radio network in a simulated environment. We offer them the tools with which to educate their end-users and develop their operating models.” Avela’s words carry the weight of almost 30 years of experience in the niche industry. She began in 1991 with a 15-year stint at Nokia’s critical comms department, which was sold to Airbus in 2005. Avela became the CEO and minority owner at Beaconsim in 2007, ultimately buying the company in 2011. Each emergency situation is unique, and hence emergency actors need to design operating models that are resilient to changing circumstances but clear enough to be intuitive to emergency personnel. Beaconsim offers its clients two types of technology-independent training simulator systems: a self-learning system and a virtual classroom. Users can practise different scenarios solo, but also develop and update ways of working together in emergency situations. “You can have a state-of-the-art technology, but, if the end-users don’t know how to use it, it’s completely useless. We’re the link between the technology and the human.” The critical communications industry holds much of the expertise that goes into building a ubiquitous information society where basically all things are online all the time. How is the industry facing the impending transformation? Critical comms plays a vital role in the Finnish government’s recently announced   programme. Here 100 million euros has been pledged to develop global networks and business related to digital trust-based solutions and services. The Finnish critical communications sector joins cybersecurity, research organisations, and Smart Finance and MyData actors in boosting growth and collaboration on a global scale. “For example, the requirements for communications in autonomous vehicles are even more stringent than certain requirements in public safety,” says Pesonen. “So, it’s a win-win situation if those requirements are agreed on more generally.” The integration of public safety networks and commercial networks could provide nations with security, better coverage, greater bandwidth and, most importantly, cost-effectiveness amidst fast-paced change. If the critical comms industry can serve as a beacon for commercial 5G, Finland is well positioned to set the standard, as  , founder of Quixoticity,  . “The country’s culture of close co-operation, its understanding of the importance of public safety and public service, and the sensible, pragmatic, multi-stage approach to migration to next-generation services while preserving the best of current systems is now allowing the Critical Communications Finland community to extend its close ties with other countries.” The Finnish example in multiagency co-operation can serve as a reference for the greater society in how to build common ways of working through co-operation and trust. The benefits can be life-saving in the future. “I think we’re at a juncture, like before Google. There’s a feeling of change. Information-centric operating models are coming, but we don’t yet know exactly what they will be,” envisions Pesonen. “Once they’re here, we’ll be wondering why we didn’t think of this before, because it feels so natural.”"

This year, when the forum returned to Helsinki, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and our very own   and invited journalists from Southeast Asia to attend and learn how Finnish companies and organisations are keeping the world spinning in the right direction. According to Sitra’s  , circular economy and sustainable solutions should not be seen only as means to save the planet but also as business cases that can help Finns gain competitive edge in untapped markets. Here are some Finnish solutions that tackle the challenges. With the mission of saving the world from plastic waste, the people at Sulapac have created a patented, biodegradable and microplastic-free material that has all the benefits of conventional plastic without taking a toll on the environment. “There are 500 million plastic straws used in America every single day and the number for Europe combined with Russia is 800 million,” said CTO  . The latest innovation from Sulapac is a marine-degradable, mass-producible straw that helps keep fish swimming. The straw has been created in collaboration with fellow Finns   and is set to be released during the second quarter of 2019. This company is definitely not going out of fashion with its technology that threads the needle for sustainable cotton, allowing the textile to be used again and again while preserving 100 per cent of its quality. According to CEO  , the time for action is now: “Fashion is the second-most polluting industry globally and getting worse. We have a solution brands love and a world-class team that get it done.” Infinited Fiber is a young startup with a mature core and over 100 years of combined experience in the global fibre industry. The forever youthful company has already worked alongside world-renowned big guns in fashion such as Adidas, H&M, Tommy Hilfiger and Wrangler. Cleaning up cities with smart solutions. The team at Smart & Clean Foundation has taken on the responsibility to orchestrate and facilitate coalitions that together can create and develop permanent sustainable solutions for society. The new governmental policy programme and   to become carbon neutral by 2035 are not making the foundation’s lips tremble. In fact, it is welcoming them with open arms. “Our goal is to become the window for global climate solutions by 2021,” asserted CEO  . One of the foundation’s latest initiatives involves creating a closed circle for plastics in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area and Lahti. All Smart & Clean partners have already committed to the project. The world’s third-most sustainable company and the highest-ranked energy company on the Global 100 list is the leading producer of 100 per cent renewable diesel. The renewable fuels produced by Neste in 2018 reduced carbon emissions by 7.9 million tonnes, which equals removing three million cars from the roads for a full year. , vice president of R&D, outlined the company’s ambition to help its customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 million tonnes every year by 2030: “We believe that climate change defines the future of the energy sector and that circular economy is the vehicle for sustainable growth, which is why we are committed to creating a healthier planet for our children by delivering cleaner fuels to the roads.” Food waste or unutilised resources? The people working at Restaurant Loop are producing delicious meals from locally sourced excess ingredients, which they receive from local merchants and producers. With its operations, the Helsinki-based non-profit wants to help reduce carbon emissions caused by the food industry. “If food waste was a country, it would be the third-largest nation in the world. We at Loop feel like we must make sure, not only through education, but also through concrete actions, that the food waste nation diminishes,”  operational manager, outlined."

In five years, there will be 57 billion wireless devices globally, estimates  , CEO of  . It is a hard number to grasp but a huge market opportunity for the Tampere-based startup which develops smart wireless devices and hardware platforms for industrial companies. Treon’s aim is to work with the top five companies across different industries. “Wireless technologies and sensors are close to our heart,” Korppi explains. “We make small, battery-operated wireless sensor devices primarily for industry, logistics and smart-buildings applications.” Treon’s strengths are in the scalability, cost-efficiency and intelligence of its technology. It can be used to monitor industrial equipment and connect them with numerous cloud platforms. The first commercial example of this is Treon’s collaboration with Swiss pump giant Sulzer. Together, the companies have developed Treon Industrial Node, a wireless device to monitor the condition of rotating machinery. Launched in mid-2019, the device can be used, for example, to detect faults and production bottlenecks. The collaboration marked a significant breakthrough for Treon. Thanks to Sulzer’s reseller network, the industrial node has been available to a global customer base from day one. Add the one million euros in seed funding that Treon raised in May, and the startup is ready for international expansion. While Treon targets big businesses, its roots lie in consumer products. The company’s seven founders all earned their spurs developing smartphones for Nokia and Microsoft. In fact, Treon was founded with support from Microsoft’s startup programme in late 2016. “We gathered the best people from Microsoft’s last mobile phone unit in Finland,” Korppi says. “Together, we possess rare technical expertise from working in the highly competitive world of smartphones.” Together, we possess rare technical expertise from working in the highly competitive world of smartphones. Treon started by designing products for others. The startup has helped various Finnish companies – including customer feedback specialist   and fellow Microsoft alumni   – to develop their smart devices. This has enabled Treon to grow its operations and finance the development of its own products. The strategy has paid off. Today, Treon employs 23 people and has just released its first commercial products: the Industrial Node, Treon Node and Treon Gateway. The nodes are sensor devices packed with measuring capabilities and the gateway devices connect them to any existing cloud platform. Together, they can be used to create connected networks with hundreds of thousands of sensors. Now the focus for Treon is expansion, bringing these devices to a global market through strategic partnerships (such as the Sulzen deal) and tapping into the partners’ reseller networks. “Our aim is to work with the top five companies across different industries. We are already in discussion with several big companies that are looking to digitalise their operations,” Korppi enthuses. Treon’s collaborative approach also applies to its tech partners. The company uses speciality technology from several Finnish companies, including Wirepas and Radientum, and works with them to develop tailored IoT packages for its customers. This approach has already found Treon pilot projects in 18 countries, including Australia, South Africa and the US. “Microsoft’s startup programme has helped to start many of these companies. It is a unique Finnish characteristic that we all know each other, and that makes it easy to work together,” says Korppi. And it is this sense of the importance of maintaining historical connections which makes Treon’s vision for a future of smart connected devices compelling. “We want to make it possible, together with our partners, to connect all kinds of devices together,” Korppi explains. “We are passionate wireless device people; we want to keep the Nokia legacy of wireless innovation alive.” One million euros in funding is one million reasons to celebrate."

Whenever consumer habits are changing, there is an opening for innovative newcomers. Enter  . The Finnish company is creating a lineup of nutritionally rich, oat-based products. Its drinkable oats are an instant alternative to the traditional oatmeal, and the firm also makes oats protein powder and oats granola. Later this year, it will launch other oat-based products, including protein puddings and shakes. “Oats are pretty much the ideal ingredient,” says  , CEO of Oatlaws. “They have loads of positive nutritional qualities with practically no negative ones.” “Since oats don’t have a strong taste, they are also very versatile and can be used for many purposes. And oats are a more sustainable ingredient than most nut or plant-based alternatives.” Teppo Ylä-Hemmilä is no stranger to oats. Ylä-Hemmilä is no stranger to oats, coming from a family of bakers that runs the bakery Viipurilainen Kotileipomo. In 2016, they launched Puhtikaura, an oats powder that could be mixed with water or milk for an instant breakfast, snack or workout drink. Puhtikaura took off big time (it won the 2016 Fin­nish Food of the Year award) and opened new doors for its creators. “Oatlaws was born as a kind of a spinoff,” Ylä-Hemmilä says. “We received a lot of enquiries from abroad, so we decided to take the concept further and develop a distinct brand around it.” The firm was founded in 2017 but took a while to find its approach. “We hadn’t quite understood how important it is for new products to fit into existing product categories,” Ylä-Hemmilä says. “Our first products ended up on the health and wellbeing shelves, and didn’t find their target audience.” After a rethink of its product line and revamp of its brand, Ylä-Hemmilä is convinced that Oatlaws is now prepared for the limelight. The first signs are promising: in March at the 2019 World Food Innovation Awards, the firm’s oat chocolate protein pudding was shortlisted in the best plant-based product category, while its oat ice cream won the award for best frozen food. The company’s products are currently featured by only a few shops in Finland, but after the summer their distribution will expand to a national level. Beyond Finland, Oatlaws aims to enter the Swedish market early next year and, from there, expand more generally to Northern Europe. The company’s granolas contain oats, seeds, extra protein, freeze-dried berries and a hint of sweetness from agave syrup. In the food industry, being a small newcomer is a challenge in many ways since the field is dominated by big players, Ylä-Hemmilä says. “You really have to prove that your products bring something new to their product categories. Otherwise shops won’t put them on the selves.” He notes that vegan products often leave a lot to be desired. “Especially vegan on-the-go products tend to have poor nutritional values, or just taste bland. We aim to lift them to the same level of quality with milk-based products.” Oatlaws also aims to develop a distinct brand – one that Ylä-Hemmilä describes as “daring, gutsy and nutritionally rich”. To spread the message, the company will focus particularly on social media marketing and target micro-influencers, such as sports coaches, physiotherapists and other wellness professionals. “In the past you could more easily buy visibility with money. It’s not so easy anymore,” Ylä-Hemmilä says. “But with a strong brand, good products and the right marketing approach, even a small company can break through.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-himss-europe-conference/,Five for Friday: HIMSS Europe Conference,"The best digital innovations in healthcare were presented this week in Helsinki by experts and fresh startups dedicated to developing the industry that keeps us healthy.  According to the experts at the  , patient outcome should be the driving force for development. Therefore, attendees were able to familiarise themselves with the latest international innovations in healthcare, patient care, digital healthcare solutions, big data, analytics, AI and machine learning. Business Finland’s media tours team, Finnfacts, invited journalists from around the globe to learn why the Finnish cutting-edge approach to healthcare is getting pulses racing in the field. Here are five Finnish solutions that are just what the doctor ordered! The aim of this service is to offer knowledge and support to all those in need, care for those that require it and tools for professionals. Co-created between patients and experts, the online service also covers specialised hospital care.  Virtual houses offering different services for different symptoms and events are found within the platform. The platform is designed to ease the monitoring of quality of life, symptoms and lifestyles, and to ease living with long-term diseases. The service emphasises the importance of instant communication and proactive care. Health Village favours service design over AI and coding and was the winner of the Outstanding ICT Achievement Award at the event. “Our ambition is to facilitate patient-expert encounters that are tailored to fit the need of specific customers and patients,” stated development manager  . “Our platform is a comprehensive digital solution for healthcare that not only enriches patient outcomes, but also helps professionals develop treatments and means for proactive care.” According to professor  , research director at  , one of the biggest challenges in medicine development are the long time spans that scientists have to work with. Founded on the belief that genetics can help expedite this process, Finngen is a collective research project where, by submitting their sample, anyone can contribute to meaningful findings and help people around the globe. Finns are in a good position to lead the way thanks to a unique genetic isolate, supportive legislation and comprehensive health records, and thus more likely to make meaningful medical discoveries than people in other parts of the world. “The Finngen project is an excellent start, but the full potential of this initiative can only be reached through global collaboration,” Palotie outlined. Artificial intelligence made easy. The people at Aiforia have created an image analysis software that lets users develop their own deep-learning AI models for identifying patterns in images, without having any experience in coding. “Our unique and intuitive interface makes the software easy to use, and, in an industry where saving time means saving lives, the faster professionals can adopt a service, the better they can provide care,” explained  , content marketing manager Aiforia has already been applied in fields such as pharmaceutical research and development, cancer research, neuroscience and pathology. Bridging the gap between technology and human touch. This service is designed to improve the quality of live for cancer patients. Kaiku Health is a platform for personalised digital health interventions created for people trying to cope with cancer. Through efficient communication and proactive care, the platform has already affected the lives of patients in a good way. “We’ve reached levels that some drugs have not reached, which goes to show how important communication and human contact is in healthcare,” said CEO  . With its name meaning “at home” in English, this service aims to provide digital healthcare for the elderly and people living with dementia in their own homes. Developed by the Service Centre of the City of Helsinki, the programme already takes care of 250 000 patient contacts every month. According to development manager  , preventive care looms in the near future, and not only does the Kotona programme provide the means for easier preventive care, it also allows the elderly to remain independent. “Remote care is an essential part of Helsinki’s future,” Finne concluded."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/safera-cooks-up-a-treat-with-smart-kitchen-sensor/,Safera cooks up a treat with smart kitchen sensor,"No timer set, extractor hood off and no one is watching over the hot stove. These are common mishaps for many home cooks, but Finnish tech company Safera is coming to their rescue.  What is the number one cause of home fires? Cooking, and many of them could be easily prevented, says Espoo-based  . Its stove guards have done precisely that for the past 10 years. Now the company is applying its knowledge to the smart home market. Safera’s new smart cooking sensor, scheduled to launch in September, promises not only to make our kitchens safer but to help us become better cooks as well. Safera Sense is designed with the distracted chef in mind. “There is no other product like this,” enthuses CEO  .“It combines a stove guard, an air quality meter and a cooking application.” The product, Safera Sense, is designed with the distracted chef in mind. At its core is a discreet sensor device which is easily attached above a stove top and can detect almost any event around the stove. Through an accompanying mobile app, Sense will alert you if the stove has been accidentally left on, automatically sets timers for specific foods and notifies you when it’s time to turn on ventilation or a pan has reached the perfect temperature for cooking. So how does it work? Sense is built on Safera’s proprietary sensor technology and data analytics. It collects data, among others, on air quality, temperature, humidity and human presence to create a visual timeline of all cooking activities. It even knows when a lid is put on a pan. And this is just the start. Safera is already planning new smart cooking features, such as detailed recipes, with future software updates. Safera began as a product design company in 2006. But when an insurance company approached it to create a way to prevent cooking fires, Reinikainen was hooked. “We benchmarked stove guards globally and noticed they were simple devices, based on detecting a single temperature. Also, they were quite hideous,” Reinikainen laughs. “We had the design, electronics and robotics expertise, so we knew we could make something better.” Safera set out to do exactly that. Instead of focusing on putting out fires, the company wanted to prevent them. It built a stove guard which immediately cuts off stove power if it senses danger. The big breakthrough for Safera came in 2009, when the City of Stockholm ordered the stove guards for all its new-build apartments. Today Safera’s products come in both integrated and stand-alone versions and can be found in over 200 000 homes. Now with Sense, the company is expanding past safety features. We believe our smart cooking sensor will bring added value to all kinds of people, but initially our focus is on smart home early-adopters,” says Mikko Reinikainen. “Our products do very well with insurers, builders and kitchen appliance manufacturers, but we started to think how could we get closer to consumers,” Reinikainen explains. “We have a lot of data on what happens around the stove. This is how we started to think about air quality and smart cooking.” Safera is on a constant lookout for future partners. Eventually, the company would like to see its sensor technology used also outside the kitchen and become an integrated part of smart home products. “Our technology has numerous potential applications globally, and some well-known consumer brands have already expressed their interest,” Reinikainen says. “In particular, air quality monitoring is a massive global trend.” Such a move would again see Safera evolve – something the company has made a habit of throughout its history. “I see that one pretty day we will be a software house,” Reinikainen envisions. “The electronics are manufactured by our partners, and we focus on software development. We have merely scratched the surface of what we can offer in future.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/do-i-know-you-alexander-yin/,Do I know you?,"Originally from China, Alexander Yin has steadily built a career in finance in Finland, pioneering solutions that have caught the attention and collaboration of Alibaba and Finnair along the way.  The words ‘quiet’ and ‘peaceful’ are synonymous with Finland. Yet, when   first visited the city of Turku in 2007, the streets of the former Finnish capital were practically empty. Nonetheless, Yin was undeterred by the lull between Christmas and New Year, and went on to commence a PhD in computer engineering in the city. With a focused work ethic he honed whilst growing up in China, Yin barely noticed the cold, dark and quiet residing outside. His second year in Finland brought with it an additional MBA to his growing workload. By the third year, an internship at the budding devops startup Eficode was also in the mix, along with his first child and his first house. Fast-forward a decade and Yin is the CFO of both Eficode and its sister company, ePassi. The two companies have grown from having 30 to more than 300 people on the payroll. This year’s forecast is more than 100 million euros in revenue. In the midst of all this growth, Yin has been a constant, despite not knowing a word of Finnish – well, with the exception of three very important words. The working culture here was much less crowded. I usually say that I am from a medium-sized city in China – only 10 million people. Yeah. [laughs] One thing that I love very much about the Finnish working culture is we really appreciate people’s family life. In Asian cultures, people just live for work. Here, even though I am an executive in the company, I always get to go home and spend a couple of hours with my kids before they go to sleep. It’s a very good part of working and living here. They admire it very much. A friend of mine there gave birth to her son and, afterwards, was replying to work emails while still in hospital. That was extreme. I do like to spend some time with my family. When I work, I work extremely hard, but when I am with my family I ensure we have quality time together. Another thing I like here, especially in our companies, is that there is no glass ceiling for foreigners in this country. I have lived here for 12 years and I can’t speak Finnish. I know how to say  [I don’t speak Finnish]. I am not a local, but still I advanced from an internship to group CFO. It took me four years – a pretty fast speed. For a person to grow in their professional career in our company, we don’t emphasise where you are from; we emphasise who you are, what you are and what you can do. That’s a really good side of this business. No, everybody can speak English in this part of the world. Of course, if you go to France it may be slightly different. Last week when I was in Madrid, chatting with one of the execs from one of the largest banks there, she also pointed out that living in the Nordics as a non-local is actually a very good thing. People here can speak English very well. Firstly, if you feel that Finnish people are cold, don’t take them the wrong way. They may just be shy. The culture is different. It doesn’t mean that they won’t help you. They actually will help you very much. Many Finnish people don’t enjoy talking too much. If you meet Finnish people at an interview, there is no small talk. There is none of this culture here. Work hard and work smart. When people come to a new country, they have to understand how the culture and society function. Just contribute as much as you can. And, um, prepare for the winter! The very beautiful thing is that July is the time for holidays here, and it is the only time you can expect some good weather. Sometimes in August, too. During the Finnish summer, I usually take a break, spend some time with my family. Mostly we stay here: go to the seaside and lakes and enjoy the nature. Here, it’s not like Tokyo or Shanghai, where you go to see tens of millions of people and skyscrapers everywhere. Here you can feel the nature and just go to the water and start swimming. I do it quite often and at home. Actually, I think sauna is great advice for those coming to work here: go to sauna with your colleagues. There is no small talk culture here, except in the sauna. There you get to know people more. Sometimes good ideas come from the sauna. We realised this and that’s why upstairs here at our office we have a private sauna. Just for our own people. We have it all the time over here. Especially on Friday afternoons, we grab some beers and have a sauna. We see this as a good way to build the team spirit. People have time to talk to one another without too many things in between. Finns are very straightforward. I like this very much. Especially when doing business. At first, it felt they were so straightforward that it was rude. If they didn’t like something, they just said it. But I quickly came to appreciate it. When doing business, one of the most valuable resources is time. If there is unlimited time, you can always do something great, but in business you don’t have this. This straightforward culture saves time for everybody. You don’t have to guess, like with some other cultures. Here people are so straightforward that if there is a possibility, you’ll know it. If not, you’ll know it too. I have a good example of how straightforward Finnish people can be. A couple of years ago when ePassi started collaborating with Alipay, one evening I was lying down thinking about how I could do something disruptive in payments. I realised that Finnair has wi-fi onboard and we have a mobile payment system – no one has done mobile payment in the sky. I immediately jumped up and Googled around, but I didn’t find anything about mobile payments in aircraft. I called the Finnair CEO at the time, spent a few minutes talking about it and he said, ‘Yeah, let’s do it. Come and talk to me. Let’s have a longer discussion’. I met both the CEO and CCO, talked about topic for 15–20 minutes and both said yes. As simple as that. The next week we had a feasibility meeting with all the people from their side – everyone from cabin crew, finance, marketing and PR. We realised that yes, it is feasible. This was November 2016. They asked me when do I think they can get this online. I said 28 January, the Chinese New Year, which would be great for PR. This was less than three months away, including Christmas and New Year. We ended up having it operational one day in advance, on 27 January. This just shows how efficient the Finnish business can be. Still today, it is the only mobile payment in the sky in the airline business globally. This country is very efficient. From a Chinese business point of view, I would say that we do not like to spend too much time going through all of the bureaucracies which happen in many countries. The whole process may take a huge amount of time. Here, it is very nice. In order to move your office from one building to another, you don’t need to go to an authority, do paperwork and wait for three weeks, like I have experienced in other countries. Also, you can set up a business here in half an hour. ICT, of course, is one. My personal opinion is that the sophisticated machinery industry may also be very interesting for Chinese companies. Even though China has its our own industry and is growing fast as a country, we can’t grow perfectly in all areas. I have also said to my business friends in China that Finland is a very good testbed for Chinese companies going to Europe. Firstly, this place is well connected to China. The connection is very good and short. The efficiency is one thing. When you want to test something, you want to test it in an efficient way – not spend half a year waiting to register a company. Also compared with other Nordic countries, which are efficient no matter where you are, Finland has the advantage of being the only Nordic country that has the euro. When you set up a place in Finland you are in the eurozone, and that is quite a good advantage. [long pause] Actually, my favourite words are  . I have used them so often [laughs]."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/angular-velocity-has-an-eagle-eye-on-sports/,Angular Velocity has an eagle eye on sports,"Finland’s Angular Velocity has completely transformed various aspects of bowling, ranging from practice to ball development, codification and broadcasting. Next it intends to do the same in other sports. has set his sights high for the 100 metres, discus throw, shot put and many other athletics events at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. He is not an up-and-coming decathlete but one of the chief developers of a device that could transfigure how athletes and coaches prepare for and how television viewers around the world experience the highly anticipated event. Angular Velocity quickly realised that the technology has applications also in other sports, particularly because of the pace at which it is capable of producing data. The device is called Specto. Not much larger than a regular-size coffee server, it is equipped with an eye-friendly laser that rotates on a 360-degree axis at a speed of 3 000 revolutions per minute, sending short pulses and measuring their reflections to determine the location of objects – static or dynamic – in its vicinity. Its applications in athletics and sports in general are manifold and, to some extent, still unknown, tells Törnqvist. The data produced by the device, he explains, can be used by coaches to reinforce their instructions to athletes, amateur athletes to improve their technique and sports networks to provide viewers with intriguing details such as the release angle and speed of a javelin thrower, or the acceleration, deceleration and maximum speed of a 100-metre sprinter. All in real time. “I guess you could say we’ve set our long-term course for the Paris Olympics in 2024. That’s when we should be able to cover all athletics events and offer a fully-fledged viewer app,” says Törnqvist. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Törnqvist reminds that, like for athletes, the road to the games will be long and hard for  , the Helsinki-based developer of Specto. The story of the company began in a bowling alley several years ago, as he and his co-founders found themselves wanting a more sophisticated system for tracking bowling balls. “All of the four founders are either bowlers or bowling coaches. Two of us, in fact, are former world champions,” he tells. “There was one tracking system on the market that was capable of tracking balls, but it was really complicated to use and didn’t really meet the needs of the sport.” The quartet eventually conducted the first tests in the second half of 2015 and, encouraged by the results, founded Angular Velocity in 2016. The world of bowling has not been the same since. “In May, we flew to Florida to meet Kegel, the third-largest player in the world of bowling and the developer of the existing tracking system. We presented our system to them and they pounced on it immediately. They had been thinking how to replace their outdated system for a long time,” recounts Törnqvist. “We unveiled it with Kegel at the International Bowl Expo in Las Vegas in June 2016. It was voted as the best new product there,” he adds. The world of bowling has not been the same since. Specto Bowling has become a true standard in the sport, having been used in the product development of all new balls since May 2017 and in research by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC). Its adoption has even led to a 30 per cent uptick in the viewership of bowling broadcasts on Fox Sports. Angular Velocity quickly realised that the technology has applications also in other sports, particularly because of the pace at which it is capable of producing data. “We were originally developing it for bowling, as it was something we all knew. Other sports came as a positive surprise in the development stages and really started to gain momentum around 2017,” says Törnqvist. The first, somewhat reckless venture outside the comfort zone was curling. “The Olympic Committee asked us to put together something for the Winter Olympics. ‘Sure,’ we decided, figuring curling wouldn’t be too different from bowling. In hindsight I’d say to myself: ‘think a little – curling has nothing to do with bowling’,” he reminisces, with a chuckle. “We basically had to revamp everything. But we did learn a lot about how to calibrate the sensor so that it’s horizontally straight and recognises the borders of the playing area much faster than before.” Törnqvist says Angular Velocity is currently co-operating with a number of sports associations partly to ensure it has access to the sport-specific knowledge necessary to reconfigure the software for new use cases. “Every sport is completely different, with its unique characteristics. We initially thought all throwing sports would be 90 per cent the same, but it has become clear that we were way off.” Angular Velocity’s first venture outside the comfort zone of bowling was curling – at the request of the Olympic Committee. Angular Velocity is set to trial its technology at domestic athletics events during the course of the summer with  , the public broadcasting company of Finland. The main goal for the year, meanwhile, has been set for the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, in September. “We’ll do four to five sports there, depending on how much we manage to get ready. We’re working on javelin throw right now. It’s one of the most difficult ones, and whether we’ll have it ready is still a bit iffy,” Törnqvist says. “The World Athletics Championships draw roughly a billion viewers worldwide. It’s a market with massive potential,” he adds. A market of such promise is bound to have also caught the attention of other technology firms. Specto, however, has a leg up on the competition due to its ability to filter out unnecessary elements from the profusion of data generated by the sensor in the blink of an eye, according to Törnqvist. “The light detection and ranging (LIDAR) tool is measuring the environment constantly, in its entirety. But if we only want data on the ball, for example, we have to filter out the walls of the bowling alley and so on,” he explains. “The algorithms we have under the hood are capable of processing the data very fast: our latency is roughly 20 milliseconds – that’s from the data input to it being ready.” “After the data has been refined, it’s sent to the cloud and thereon to the laptop, tablet or smartphone of the end user.” This wealth of data is precisely why at least some of the technology’s future applications remain unknown. Törnqvist says he and his colleagues are constantly discovering new ways to utilise the data and using that knowledge to develop the functionalities and interface of the software. In Doha, he tells, viewers should have access to a small part of the measurement data through television and find additional details of the performance of athletes through the viewer app. A larger trove of data will be presented to researchers at IAAF. “What’s good is that we’re not producing data only for TV, but data that can be used over and over again. We’re turning data into a service,” he says. Angular Velocity is set to ramp up its presence in Helsinki, raising its headcount by 15 by mid-2020 and another 15 by 2021, says Kristian Törnqvist (left), the CEO of Angular Velocity."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/air0-brings-a-breath-of-fresh-air-to-china/,Air0 brings a breath of fresh air to China,"Air purifiers are a growing market but one plagued by uncertain quality. Finnish company Air0 believes there is a more efficient way to clean indoor air and has built the technology to prove it. Poor indoor air quality has a direct effect on our health. It can vary from fatigue and headaches to respiratory diseases and even reduced life expectancy. While a growing number of air purifiers promise to tackle the issue,   believes their quality still leaves much to be desired. “Most air purifiers today use HEPA filtration, which, in short, is a very tight filter. It filters impurities well but, at the same time, blocks a lot of air from flowing through it,” explains Air0 co-founder and CEO  . “It means it can’t cycle enough air to clean an entire room.” “Finland has the cleanest air in the world and a very good reputation in our customer segment in China,” Valle Kulmala says. Air0 has taken a different approach. This was easier said than done, but after two years of development, the company finalised a patented four-step process in 2016. The commercial result is the smAIRt1200, an efficient, silent air purifier capable of cleaning rooms of up to 150 square metres. Air0 also focuses heavily on aesthetics, housing it in a design of wood, fabric and customisable colours. This has brought attention from China, where the product is used in large public spaces, such as hotels, offices and kindergartens. Now Air0 has squeezed the same tech into the more compact smAIRt600: “It is suitable for business users with smaller rooms but can also be used by consumers,” Kulmala enthuses. “It can still clean rooms as large as 75 square metres.” Air0 was born in 2013 after its CTO and co-founder,  , visited China. It was there Rajala first realised the full extent of air purification problems and, as a known inventor with over 500 patents under his belt, started to think about a solution. “Markku got an idea for a technology that uses looser filters [than HEPA]. Typically the problem is they don’t clean impurities well enough, but he thought about combining the looser filters with an electrical booster,” Kulmala recalls “This could be used to create an air purifier with a very high cleaning efficiency and air flow rate.” While many purifiers promise to remove harmful particles, allergens, smokes and smells, Rajala’s idea not only achieved this, but also gave the 10-person company from Espoo its differentiator: scale. “We knew we had a great technology, but since our competitors in China are big companies like Haier and Samsung we had to pick our target group very carefully,” Kulmala says. “There is less competition in the business market, and our products stand out even better there because of the amount of air they can clean.” The next step for Air0 is full automation. The company will soon release a cloud-based system which continuously monitors air quality and automatically adjusts the purifiers as necessary. It is part of Air0’s bid to grow its business presence in Finland, Sweden and, in particular, in China. “We are really pleased our demand is constantly growing in China, but our market share there is still small,” Kulmala explains. “It’s a huge market, its size is hard to grasp even for us who deal with it daily. Shanghai alone is as big a market as the Nordics together.” Air0 is also eyeing other Asian markets, such as Korea and Japan, and new segments including the consumer market. But for the company, the focus will always be on technology. “Our long-term goal is to be the globally leading air quality company. Not necessarily in terms of turnover, but we want to be the innovator and trendsetter in the industry,” Kulmala concludes. Air0 is a rare company in that its air purifiers are made in Finland but primarily exported to China. Text: Eeva Haaramo"

With his help, we can reach a worldwide audience.” Working with a 130-employee company is a change for Räikkönen, but iLOQ’s technology convinced him. The company has developed the world’s first self-powered digital lock. Instead of cables or batteries, the lock harvests electricity from key insertion alone. The key also cannot be copied because its access rights are managed remotely online and it can be endlessly reprogrammed. “iLOQ’s solutions are technically advanced, but they are extremely simple for their customers to use. That is something that really interests me,” Räikkönen enthused in a press release. “And the people that work there have drive, passion and a pioneering attitude. They don’t follow traditional rules but are prepared to break new ground and shake things up a bit. I respect that attitude.” iLOQ was founded in 2003 with a mission to replace mechanical locks and keys. Its first product, the iLOQ S10 self-powered digital lock, was launched in 2007 and targeted at large buildings such as offices, public buildings and residential properties. iLOQ’s solutions are technically advanced, but they are extremely simple for their customers to use. In 2016, the company went a step further with its mobile access management system, iLOQ S50. Designed for utilities, it allows them to grant and revoke access instantly and record all comings and goings on a cloud-based platform. But the real innovation is that S50 removes the need for a physical key. An app is used to open doors, and the lock cylinder harvests the energy required to unlock from a smartphone. “Even if a phone is stolen, it is still protected by a screen lock,” Hiltunen explains. “Access cannot be copied from one device to another, all data traffic is encrypted, and our cybersecurity level is on a par with banks.” So far, S50 has been a hit with large utility companies and even one municipality. For example, the telecom group Telia Finland chose S50 to manage access to its 30 000-square metre data centre in Helsinki, while the Rautalampi municipality in Central Finland installed the system to secure its water treatment plan for the region. “Traditionally if a key is lost, the lock needs to be changed. In our system a lost key isn’t a security risk as access rights are managed remotely,” says iLOQ CEO Heikki Hiltunen. Pictured on the left, delivery operator Aleksi Mäkeläinen. But innovation alone doesn’t drive a company. iLOQ already has branches across the Nordics, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, and now the company is targetting stronger growth from its collaboration with Räikkönen. iLOQ’s initial focus is Central Europe, where its lock cylinders already fit most modern lock bodies, but next come Asia and North America. Hiltunen knows such ambition means increased competition. Even though technology giants like Amazon and Google are moving into the security market, iLOQ is confident in its products. “We see these types of companies as potential partners. They don’t yet have a solution like ours and we are technology-independent so we can easily work with anyone,” Hiltunen explains. “In fact, I’d welcome that kind of a partnership.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-dog-friendly-solutions/,Five for Friday: Dog-friendly solutions,"These Finnish companies are bringing the best to man’s best friend. Dog food, dog training, a gel that reduces anxiety in dogs and a dog health tracker – these doggy innovations are making the world wag its tail. The Turku-based company specialises in dog training online and with smart devices and has a distinctive method of training through the dog’s perspective. Just this week, it landed 500 000 euros in crowdfunding. It will use the funds to pursue growth and launch its new online puppy training programme globally this summer. “Our most important goal now is to find the most scalable way for customer acquisition and start implementing it first in North America,”  . Why give your best friend just anything to eat? This company’s range of dog food uses ingredients that are of high enough quality for human consumption. Dinner for two, then! Everything comes from close by, and the company avoids listing fancily named foodstuffs, favouring nutritional value instead. “Even in Finland, authorities have been delighted that, because our product is fully Finnish, it must comply with Finnish regulations,”   “As Finnish food is world-famous for its purity and high quality, it can be trusted elsewhere too.” We all wish we could ask our dogs how they’re doing. This company lets data speak. Anaxeos is a lightweight vest with sensors that track things such as heart rate and temperature, connected to a mobile app that then reveals the data and interprets it so that the dog’s carer can take action. “Anaxeos doesn’t make pie charts and histograms,”  . “Instead, it makes sense of the numbers and gives alerts and suggestions regarding things like what to do if your dog’s temperature is too high.” Back in 2017, a research group led by Finnish scientists landed an award for their study that investigated a dexmedetomidine oromucosal gel for treating noise anxiety in dogs. They concluded that the gel can help to improve the wellbeing of dogs affected by noise sensitivity. “There is an unmet need for treatment options for dogs suffering from noise anxiety,”  . “Our study demonstrated that dexmedetomidine oromucosal gel provides veterinarians a treatment option for alleviation of acute anxiety and fear associated with noise in dogs.” Looking for some variety of cuisine for your best friend? This company offers flavours without grains, additives or preservatives, and the food is not heated during the preparation process either. “All of our products are natural and we are imitating the food that dogs have been eating the last 30 000 years and what a canine would eat by instinct, if it was living in the wild,”  ."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/megical-brings-black-box-thinking-to-healthcare/,Megical brings black-box thinking to healthcare,"Aviation is light-years ahead of healthcare in terms of using data to improve safety. Helsinki-based Megical has set out to bridge the gap by injecting a dose of black-box thinking to healthcare. Two Finnish airline pilots take their seats in the cockpit of an aircraft set to take off to Milan, Italy. They exchange pleasantries, this being the first they meet, but as the aircraft advances toward its destination their conversation veers to the safety and risk management systems in aviation. “One of our competitive advantages is that, through our experience in aviation, we know what day-to-day work is like in a safety-critical sector,” says Jussi Kajovaara, the COO at Megical. This is not the setup of a delicious – and oddly specific – joke, but a defining moment in the history of  , a Finnish developer of a platform for improving the safety of clinical care. “We started working on a better risk management system for aviation until we realised that aviation is already relatively safe,” tells one of the pilots and current chief operating officer at Megical,  . “But there was a need for our ideas in healthcare. So I changed the subject of my thesis to safety and risk management in medical care, and the company turned its course towards healthcare.” Airline safety has improved considerably over the past couple of decades. To70, a Dutch consulting firm specialising in aviation,   that the fatal accident rate for large commercial flights stood at 0.06 per million flights in 2017. Although the rate   last year, the year was the third safest ever in terms of the number of fatal accidents,   to the Aviation Safety Network. Kajovaara and  , the founder and chief executive of Megical, attribute the positive long-term development to the fact that flight data is monitored and analysed continuously, not only in the event of an accident. “This is the thinking we’re bringing to healthcare,” says Kajovaara. “The industries are different, but there’s no reason why you couldn’t introduce a similar system to healthcare.” Although obviously not directly comparable, statistics from the healthcare industry do indeed seem strikingly different. The World Health Organization (WHO) has   that an adverse in-hospital event occurs in roughly 10 per cent of the over 420 million patients who are hospitalised annually around the world and, more importantly, that at least a half of the events could be prevented. The healthcare system hasn’t really kept pace with medicine. The idea of our platform is to make sure it does catch up. Even though roughly two-thirds of the events occur in low- and middle-income countries, patient safety is a concern also in Finland:   suggests that around one per cent of hospital patients suffer a serious health detriment due to an adverse event and that a fifth of the one billion-euro costs of the events could be avoided. “The healthcare system hasn’t really kept pace with medicine. The idea of our platform is to make sure it does catch up,” views Kajovaara. The platform consists presently of two separate elements: A checklist that can be customised for each care pathway and medical professional, and covers the entire care pathway of patient – from admission to post-operative recovery at home. A reporting tool that has been shown to result in an over tenfold increase in reports submitted by medical professionals. “We started with the components that create the quickest benefits to customers,” tells Kajovaara. “But we’re already on our way to creating a more comprehensive platform that’s based on a dashboard and that tells concretely what has happened in terms of care at both the individual and statistical level. Any data that’s of operational importance will be visualised and presented to the management.” “We’re not just building a dashboard that siphons data from others, but we’re able to provide tools that support care and gather data.” Megical has recently made its first foray into the international marketplace, announcing a pilot project with a hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Megical announced recently it has completed a 1.2 million-euro funding round with participation from   and the founders of  ,  ,  and  . The funding will enable the company to both recruit new employees and realise its vision of the clinical pathway platform, according to Kajovaara.´ In the future, he envisions, the platform will include an app that tells patients who have undergone an operation what exactly was done to them, when and why. Another idea on the drawing board is a microchip-fitted bracelet for patients that ensures, for example, the surgical team has all the necessary information before administering anaesthesia. “It’s important that the transfer of critical patient data is seamless,” underlines Kajovaara. Megical has also begun exploring ways to utilise artificial intelligence to analyse the data generated by its platform throughout the care pathway and determine the efficacy of different medical procedures on certain types of patients. “We’ve looked into how the data we produce can be stored in a format that can be rummaged by artificial intelligence,” he tells. “At its best, artificial intelligence could enable you to monitor medical procedures in real time and tell both what are the possible outcomes if someone makes a mistake and how to move on after the mistake.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/supermood-looks-at-beauty-from-all-angles/,Supermood looks at beauty from all angles,"A jar of expensive body lotion won’t help much if other parts of one’s wellbeing are routinely neglected. Finnish company Supermood is spreading its holistic approach to feeling well across the US. Co-founder Anne Kukkohovi is well known in Finland as a TV presenter and former model. Wellbeing isn’t just about one thing – and thus feeling unwell can’t be fixed with just one simple solution. “Our idea is that beauty and wellbeing are a sum of three factors,” explains   CEO of  . “The first is how you nourish yourself; the second is how you look after the largest organ of the human body, your skin; and the third is about how you rest and let your body recover.” Due to its holistic approach, Supermood isn’t an ordinary natural cosmetics company. Instead, it offers a selection of products that are aimed to support all aspect of beauty both internally and externally. The three product ranges are called Beauty Sleep, Youth Glo and Egoboost, each of which is meant to focus on one area with various kinds of products. For example, Beauty Sleep includes an anti-wrinkle pillow, originally developed to plastic surgery patients. Youth Glo, in turn, fights the signs of ageing with skin products, capsules and even chocolate, and the Egoboost selection boosts ‘external radiance’, as the company puts it. Supermood might not be a household name in Finland, but abroad it’s gaining plenty of traction. The idea originated from co-founder  , who’s well known in Finland as a TV presenter and former model. As someone who was used to premium beauty products, she was surprised to find out how difficult it was to find high-quality natural cosmetics. “She started researching organic cosmetics but didn’t come across anything that appealed to her,” Joni Kukkohovi notes. Together, Joni and Anne Kukkohovi started looking at the market and noticed that premium-quality natural cosmetics was a widely underserved market. As is the case with a lot of startups, Supermood was created to answer the needs of its creators. The company was founded in 2014 by the Kukkohovis and two other business partners, one of whom had plenty of experience in dietary supplements and health products and the other a background in the beauty business and selective cosmetics. A suitable manufacturer was found in Helsinki, and so Anne Kukkohovi came up with the concepts – and even tested all the products herself prior to officially required testing. CEO Joni Kukkohovi Supermood doesn’t target women of any particular age. Instead, Joni Kukkohovi says that the products are designed for people who are used to using luxury cosmetics but have taken note of the rise of eco-friendliness and naturalness. “Values are by far the most defining factor in purchase decisions,” he says. “That’s also why we are careful in our profiling and, for example, how we choose partners.” From the word go, it has been obvious that the Finnish market is nowhere near large enough for a brand like Supermood. The company has been gaining interest from all over the world, but, with its three-strong team, Kukkohovi tells that it has had to prioritise tasks. Right now, the focus is on the US, where the company has a local manufacturer and a logistics partner. “The US is a challenging and demanding market but also inspiring and full of things we can learn,” he notes. “All of our efforts are there at the moment, but in the future we can utilise the lessons from North America elsewhere.” Some steps have been taken in Russia, and there are resellers here and there in some EU countries and Singapore. In the future, expansion will happen mainly through partners and agents. Questions and requests keep flying in from places like Dubai and Asia, but Kukkohovi likes to keep things simple and sensible. “With our current model, we’ve got no way of handling various markets at once. Our main goal now is to establish ourselves in the US and strengthen our position there.” Finding the sweet spot. Supermood is currently training its focus on the US market."

Finland has long cultivated a reputation for liquorice excellence and has also recently begun making chocolaty waves among sweet tooth-types worldwide. Driven by personal passion, these folks are on a mission to feed fellow liquorice-lovers around the world with top-shelf takes on the classic sweet treat. The Finnish liquorice serves every mood of the day and can even be used in cooking – ever tried sea salt-infused liquorice in a red wine sauce, for example? “This has been a passion-driven project, and our goal from the beginning has been to take LIQ into international markets and make it big,”  . This raw chocolate company has made serious inroads in the US market by knowing how to satisfy even the most demanding sweet tooth. It also has plans to disrupt the food industry for the better. “We want to change how the food industry operates and bring joy and wellbeing to it,”  . “We want to be a global brand, but instead of mass production we will get there with our own selection of niche products.” Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you are going to get. Open a bar of Taiga, however, and you’re guaranteed to receive a burst of nutrition straight from Finnish forests – and its rivers too, if you fancy a fish-flavoured sweet treat. Yep! “In five years, I believe that we will have a world-class brand that brings a positive feeling to people worldwide,”  . “If somebody mentions that they like Taiga that should mean something to the other person; in other words, wonderful chocolate.” These colourful and fun sweets have managed to convince those whose fancy isn’t tickled by traditional liquorice. Responsible for the ubiquitous metre-long liquorice that can be found at fairs and festivals around the country, the company has reached out to vegan palates in recent years with its Happy Reindeer range. Customers in Finland and abroad licked their lips in satisfaction. “There is plenty of potential in the international market, and we’re constantly looking for new distributors,”  . For Finnish chocolate maker  , the key to great chocolate is the absence of any additives except time and creativity. After changing his focus to making bean-to-bar chocolate, Westerlund went on to win a prize for his Madagascar milk chocolate. “Chocolate is a fascinating raw material that can be made into anything – the sky is the limit,”  . “I eat chocolate everyday but still cannot get enough of it. That is also why I do this – I like it so much,” he added."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kude-is-the-cornerstone-of-a-curvy-wardrobe/,KUDE is the cornerstone of a curvy wardrobe,"Finnish company KUDE thinks clothes shouldn’t go out of fashion or style – they should be so classy and durable that they last beyond fads and seasons. All KUDE clothes are designed to never go out of fashion.  doesn’t like full wardrobes. She likes purposeful wardrobes. “I don’t design collections for changing seasons,” she emphasises. “What I do is the bedrock of style.” Pakarinen, the founder and CEO of  , created her very own brand when she realised she could no longer tolerate the status quo of the fast-fashion industry, let alone understand why everything seemed to be made for just one generic shape of the female body. She describes herself as “short and curvy” – and she knows she’s not the only one. “I couldn’t find nice-looking, ecologically made and high-quality clothing, and at the same time I started to really feel fed up with the single-use culture of fashion,” she recalls. “I’m not the one for no-brain bulk; I wanted to do something that has a meaning and push the industry to change its habits.” As a fashion designer with a background in digital retail and marketing in positions such as product manager and buyer, Pakarinen was well aware of the realities of the field. When she began to take note of how it all contradicted her values, she wanted to jump off the bandwagon and focus on what feels right – and looks good and is comfortable to wear, of course. The company is looking to a future abroad. Pakarinen points out that it’s impossible to flatter all body types with one design. Thus, she decided to focus on her own, being confident that there are others who’ll be fond of it, too. She designs the clothes in Finland, and the production happens in Finland, Estonia and a Finnish-owned factory in Portugal. That way, she can keep track of what’s happening in the factories, what materials are used and where they are sourced from. Instead of collections that come and go, KUDE offers everyday classics that can be easily combined with all kinds of styles. Everything started out with a couple of T-shirts that Pakarinen created to please her personal taste. “I couldn’t find high-quality ones that would fit my body type and have no ‘bling bling’. For years, I’ve spoken about ‘the cornerstones of wardrobes’ that don’t get ruined in wash and stand both time and use.” The selection has since expanded, and Pakarinen has closely listened to the wishes of her customers. She has been keen to hear what colours, shapes, sizes and styles are lacking. KUDE also puts emphasis on everyday items. Pakarinen has never understood why people are willing to spend big money on fancy dresses that are worn once or twice a year, but turn into cheapskates when it comes to daily outfits. “It’s the wrong way around! It makes a lot more sense to invest in the clothes that are worn all the time.” The company logo. KUDE’s philosophy of focusing on one body type has worked, and Pakarinen has no plans to start changing shapes. “The same design simply can’t feel comfortable in XS and 6XL,” she explains. “Unless it’s just a huge sack, and I don’t want to make or wear huge sacks.” Pakarinen has noticed that a lot of people have their wardrobes packed with items that don’t really fit. They might be too small, the wrong colour, have sleeves that feel uncomfortable or – it might be difficult to pinpoint what’s wrong – the fit just doesn’t feel right. To help people, Pakarinen used to organise training sessions to make the best of the wardrobes they had. Now she no longer has the time for training, but the lessons she learnt have impacted KUDE to this day. “It was a great way to understand what’s expected from clothes and what the everyday struggles and challenges are. It was like doing field work in other people’s wardrobes.” Now, KUDE is expanding its online store abroad, with Sweden, Germany, Austria and France in sight first and other countries quite possibly following suit. “I’m sure there are curvy women all over the world.” Pakarinen designs the clothes in Finland, and the production happens in Finland, Estonia and a Finnish-owned factory in Portugal."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lokitime-to-become-new-standard-in-key-management/,LokiTime to become new standard in key management,"LokiTime, a cloud-based service developed by Finland’s Sowellus, could be the key for boosting efficiency for anyone responsible for issuing and managing keys, mechanical or electronic. People today are using all sorts of keys, electronic tags and other security tokens regularly to access locked and restricted areas such as blocks of flats, office buildings, schools and sports centres. Many, if not all, of the keys have been issued and are managed – at times fastidiously, at others haphazardly – by lessors, locksmiths, property owners and managers, and building maintenance and security service providers. It is a lot of work, especially as much of it is still done manually with a spreadsheet or, even, pen and paper. “It’s very inefficient,” says  , the CEO of  . He is stating the obvious, but he is doing so to call attention to the problems that arise from such practices. “When you issue and manage keys manually – using a pen and paper, spreadsheet or oral agreement – the security risks become high if a key is lost, information is misentered or a piece of paper goes missing,” he explains. “And of course all kinds of costs arise from the contract lapses caused by broken promises.” Sowellus has the answer: LokiTime. Developed in co-operation with locksmiths and security industry operators, the cloud service promises to ease the daily life of anyone responsible for issuing and managing keys. We’re are pursuing rapid international growth in the coming years. We’re now looking for growth funding to enter the markets as soon as possible. Pohjola says LokiTime is an easy-to-use service that makes it possible to add, issue and manage keys with a mobile device. The app generates an issuance agreement automatically whenever a new key is issued and saves the agreement immediately in the cloud, allowing the administrator to manage the data securely. “All the data is safe in the cloud. That’s the most important thing,” he stresses. The availability of real-time information on all keys, in turn, enables the administrator to deliver on its security promise, increase the efficiency of its operations, and develop and offer new services to its customers, according to Pohjola. “What makes the service unique is its suitability for shared use. With monitoring views and sub-accounts, you can offer everyone real-time information on all keys to a particular property.” Sowellus, he reveals, has conducted a questionnaire that found that switching from manual to automated digital key management practices creates weekly work time savings of a couple of hours per property. “The direct savings in work time add up to 240 euros a year per building. The indirect savings arising from the minimisation of claims, re-serialisations and loss of data can amount to thousands of euros a year,” he adds. The potential savings, naturally, vary depending on the number of properties managed by the client. “The suppliers of different lock systems often provide their own management systems, meaning that if someone is responsible for managing keys to 100 properties they will have to use a variety of tools to do so. LokiTime makes it possible for them to manage all keys with a single system,” tells Pohjola. LokiTime is presently used by hundreds of public and private organisations, as well as local administrations, to manage almost 350 000 keys to 4 000 properties in Finland. Although Finland remains the main market for the company, the service has been adopted also in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Sowellus has already developed an understanding of the competitive and regulatory environment in key markets in the Nordics and Central Europe, with the help of internationalisation funding from  . “We’re are pursuing rapid international growth in the coming years,” states Pohjola. We’re now looking for growth funding to enter the markets as soon as possible. We’ll expand our sales organisation during the course of this year and also make recruitments to customer service and support positions.” The benefits offered by the service have recently been recognised also by large international property management companies, such as Newsec, the largest specialised real estate company in Northern Europe. “They’re using LokiTime to protect their most valuable assets, their master keys,” says Pohjola. Also the existing clientele has helped to unlock new growth potential for Sowellus, realising that the cloud-based service is a convenient way to issue and manage not only keys, but also a variety of other borrowable items such as tools and equipment. “LokiTime can be used to sign and create receipts of the delivery of postal parcels to the reception of a hotel, for example,” says Pohjola. “We ran with the idea and successfully expanded our operations.” “Our message in the future will be that you can issue and manage anything with LokiTime. Not just keys, even though they’ll have a big role also going forward,” he envisions. Sowellus believes LokiTime can become an industry standard for key management and control systems, says Tuomas Pohjola (second from left), the chief executive of the software firm."

If you happened to pay a visit to  back in March, you may have stumbled across some memorable live footage of bodies climbing in and out of an ice hole carved in the frozen sea. If that wasn’t enough to provoke a gaping jaw, then perhaps it was the fact that they were doing it in front of a crowd ­– while pitching their startup company to a panel of investors – that etched it firmly in your memory.  has particularly fond memories of Polar Bear Pitching. He was the master of ceremonies at the event for the first time, his witty banter with the participants keeping the live stream moving along at a brisk pace. Such vocal talent is just the tip of the, ahem, iceberg. Read on as he answers a variety of questions, touching on  ,   and the versatility of the ukulele. Hosting is always a team effort and there’s no way I could have done anything without my co-hosts,   and  , and all the people working with us. It was also extremely interesting to work with a professional video production company like Saha Productions, which was in charge of the broadcasting part of Polar Bear Pitching. They really showed us the level of detail you have to get to in order to take an event like Polar Bear Pitching and make it into a TV-style broadcast! But most importantly, I learnt that hosting something in sub-zero temperatures for two hours straight calls for: 
– three layers of woollen socks 
– two layers of recreation insulated trousers 
– warm gloves, a scarf and a beanie 
– a lot of jumping and hot chocolate to keep you alive! Such a classic question – early bird, night owl or something in between. From the bright rays of the rising sun in the morning to midnight stillness in the night, I can definitely see that the different sides of the coin have their own, unique perks. But when we talk about productivity, it’s the early mornings that do the trick for me. There’s something magical in the air when you wake up and start doing something while the rest of the world is still fast asleep. No interruptions, like beeps from your phone or email, no noise from cars hurrying to work, no – nothing! It feels as if time slows down and you’re able to do whatever you like! In the coming years, humanity will be facing several challenges that can either pose an existential threat (like climate change) or severely affect our lives and wellbeing (e.g. overuse of natural resources). These so-called wicked problems are extremely complex, and the only way to solve them is to make people collaborate across disciplines. However, it’s easier said than done. For example, if you think about the evolution of science and how the amount of information has grown exponentially in the last 200 years, it was necessary to move from Renaissance geniuses like Da Vinci, who excelled in several fields, into well-defined disciplines and institutions, where a researcher can concentrate on a much more focused field. Now, if this has been the trend for the last couple of centuries, it’s not very easy to take a step back and say: ‘Hey, in order to solve these new wicked problems, we would need to become a little more like Da Vinci again’. However, this is what is desperately needed right now – so desperately that even institutionalised funding systems have started shifting their focus to transdisciplinary projects and activities. What’s unique about the University of Oulu (even on a global scale) is that it’s a full-fledged science university that houses six of its eight faculties, everything from humanities to science, under one roof and minimises the physical limitations for collaboration. And I gotta say, our university is among the very first to invest this much in these kinds of activities and I feel very proud to be able to work with such pioneers. I usually start with a lot of experimenting – high or low, rough or smooth, young or old etc. – to get some sort of a feel of what the character could be. Once I feel that there’s enough material to go by, I start to think about the individual persona of each character that was created: for example, are these the kinds of persons I may have met in real life? Usually, I also like to do test runs with my friends to get some ideas from them too. Then the rest of the process is a  -style frenzy of trial and error until some persona just ‘settles in’ and you sort of know that this is the right one! Firstly, I’d like to point out that learning Finnish is one of the most joyful things you could ever do in life! I mean, Finnish is such a ‘small’ language that whenever we Finns see or hear someone go through the effort of learning our language, we shower them with love and encouragement! It’s so amazing! Secondly, the best way to learn Finnish is to speak it! If ever there was a safe haven for language learners where you can practice a language that you don’t yet fully know without the fear of making mistakes, it’s Finland and its people! Contrary to popular belief, we are quite talkative and even more so if somebody’s learning Finnish! So, if you want to learn Finnish, approach a Finn and start talking! You will learn the language and get the most supportive and encouraging language teacher, an admirer and a lifelong friend in the same package! And finally, Finnish is the best language for delivering secret messages – even Google and Apple can’t understand us! It has probably been the mentality that in order to live ‘well’, you should live your life as others have defined it for you. Do this before that and so on. Professionally, I thought it’d be the degree or something else that dictates how you move forward. Then I came to Oulu and saw how people didn’t let their degree or background hold them back and how so many were driven by their passion to do what they really liked. I really feel that I would have never been able to overcome my earlier mindset without the example, support and encouragement of the people I’ve met and worked with here in Oulu. And for that, I will be eternally grateful! Extremely happy and humbled. It’s as if you won the lottery, if you were born in Finland. Although there are always things to improve, we’re extremely lucky (and well-off) in so many areas. And to be honest, I think we take happiness for granted too often, and we don’t fully understand how lucky we actually are. This is why I’d like to challenge you, dear readers, to do the following: Every day, just before you go to sleep, think about the things in your life that you’re grateful for. And whenever you’re feeling down, start going through the list again and cherish those things. You may be positively surprised! This is a difficult question! If I left out all the equipment necessary for survival (like knives and other DIY stuff), I would go for my ukulele. Why? Since there’s one thing I couldn’t live without and that’s music. And in an emergency, I could use the strings as utensils while eating coconuts I collected from the trees! Just like building characters for voiceovers, I like to spend time familiarising myself with the task ahead. A successful speaking gig is about positive interaction: bringing yourself and your energy to the occasion but also acknowledging your audience. It’s always a two-way effort. Most importantly, I’ll make sure that I eat and sleep well before the gig. To quote one famous commercial: “You’re not you when you’re hungry (and sleepy)”. And trust me, nobody wants to see me hungry and sleepy! My dad told me to invest in bonds. So, I bought 100 copies of  . (insert laugh here)."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cargo-transport-is-a-lot-cooler-thanks-to-finnair/,Cargo transport is a lot cooler thanks to Finnair,"An 80 million-euro investment is ensuring that Finnish national carrier Finnair is at the forefront of logistics automation and technical expertise. The person manning the small security building outside the main gate of  ’s   is proving difficult to locate. After some minutes of scouring the exterior, searching in vain for the guard, something catches my eye some 100 metres away: a clearly marked pedestrian entrance to the terminal. Finnair’s cargo hub enables quick loading of planes and freight trucks. It appears I have been trying for the last five minutes to enter the terminal entrance designated for lorries. “That building is actually our meeting room now,” explains Finnair’s director of cargo excellence, , a few minutes later, with a good-natured chuckle. “After we opened the cargo terminal in 2018, it was manned for a while, but now there is only a tablet there for lorry drivers to register themselves with.” Such a digital-first approach can be found throughout the entirety of the cargo hub, located a stone’s throw from Helsinki Airport. “We have decided no more pen and paper and that we have to use modern devices. Once all processes are digital, you can use the data to steer people and tasks in real time,” Soinola outlines. Inside the hub, forklifts whizz past as conveyor belts and automated cranes shift boxes from storage to racking and retrieve them for pallet build-up for planes and lorries. Operating around the clock, this orchestra of logistics ensures that pallets can be ready for loading onto planes in a mere 40 minutes. It is, for lack of a better word, cool. Very, very cool. Cargo’s competitive edge is speed. Airfreight represents less than one per cent of transportation, but its value is 35 per cent. It wasn’t always this way. Back at the start of the decade, Finnair was looking for ways to improve its cargo handling. Its existing cargo hub, built in 1976, had already been expanded three times and was groaning under the weight of operations. The impending arrival of larger Airbus 350 aircraft spurred the company into action, as the fleet would mean that cargo could be transported at greater volumes and speeds. “Concept planning commenced in 2013 and the terminal opened some five years later,” Soinola recalls. “Half of this time was spent before the actual building of the terminal, with the testing of the system, then training.” The comprehensive getting-up-to-speed of staff was needed in order to adapt to the new ways of working. Whilst numerous cargo hubs around the world can boast similarly impressive automation, where Finnair is leading the pack is in its COOL Control Center. Here all processes can be accurately tracked, as teams of experts monitor the journey of every plane and lorry. “We wanted to move away from the old way of working and create transparency. In order to have a good functional service, we needed an understanding of the daily production targets, e.g. daily loads of import and export and special cargo, how much needs to be built to pallets by what deadline, etc.,” Soinola says.  is the time taken for salmon to travel from Norwegian waters to a Japanese plate via COOL.  of cargo flows are in transit at COOL.  of goods carried by Finnair Cargo is seafood cargo.  of special cargo is transported by Finnair Cargo every day.  solar panels are on the roof of COOL terminal.  is the total capacity of COOL. One of the chief functions of the COOL Control Center is monitoring the temperature of every piece of sensitive cargo via digital temperature sensors and geolocation technology. Helping facilitate the handling of delicate wares, the hub houses a number of temperature-controlled areas, each tailored to preserve cargo such as pharmaceuticals. “The global value of transported pharma is 300 billion euros,” says  , managing director at Finnair Cargo. “Up to 12.5 billion euros’ worth is destroyed as the products need to be stored between 15 and 25 degrees.” Finnair has also carved a niche for itself by accommodating perishables such as seafood. In fact, as a direct result of its COOL hub, it takes only 36 hours to transport salmon from Norwegian waters to a plate in Japan. The physical proximity of the cargo hub to the airport means that temperature sensitive goods can arrive at the aircraft stand only 30 minutes before departure, further reducing the possibility of spoilage and thus underlining the hub’s competitive edge. “Someone came up to me after a speech I gave at a symposium, saying, ‘We have had a lot of talk in the airfreight business about how the industry should be developed in future, but finally somebody is doing it,’” recalls Janne Tarvainen. “We are!” The continuous streamlining of operations at the COOL hub is forging a promising future for Finnair. While airfreight represents less than one per cent of global trade volume, its value is 35 per cent. Needless to say, speed is essential for this. Couple this with Finland’s strategic geographical position as a gateway to Asia, and the company is poised for greater things. The initiatives of certain global giants are also playing into its hands. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, for example, has recently pledged the target of door-to-door delivery globally within 72 hours. “Without excellent data and co-operation with stakeholders, including customs, this is not possible. They are doing a lot of collaboration to create this,” Tarvainen says. One option being tabled is performing customs operations in the air, meaning that the turnaround time for goods at the Helsinki hub would be even shorter before being sent around the EU. According to Tarvainen, all of this pioneering change taking place is a direct reaction of an industry that has been spinning its wheels with an old-fashioned, conservative approach to doing business. “I’m 100 per cent sure there will be a disruption of the industry soon,” he continues. “It may come from within the system, or from Amazon or Alibaba. There will be significant change.” He pauses for a moment. “We should be prepared for the future. The disruption is coming. We want to be part of that.” Finland’s geographical location brings the same competitive edge to cargo transport as it does with passenger traffic."

Covering everything from random content to contracts, interaction, advertising and immersive travel, these Finnish companies have found innovative ways to make videos their bread and butter. While content may be king, the option not to choose it yourself has proven to be just as popular. For the founders of Neverthink, the simple idea of a background companion has turned into a global success. “If you want to watch a specific video you go to YouTube, and if you want to watch movies you go to HBO or Netflix,”  , “but if you just want instant hands-free entertainment while eating, while doing exercise or just chilling – then you go to Neverthink.” What do predators on the savannah and videos in online sales have in common? This company figured it out – and is now measurably boosting webshops with its simple tool. Videoly’s idea is to use pre-existing content to enable online shops to add videos without having to actually film them. “Because a video stimulates various senses, it’s very resource-efficient for the brain,”  . “We’re not sure where the future will take us, but we already know it’ll be bright. We want to be the go-to video solution for everyone, globally,” she added. This Finnish company hopes to transform how we contract renovation and construction works. The Sessio app lets you record a local video or a video call where you describe the specifics of the works. The app captures the audio and video, and lets you take still photos and draw on them. Finally, you can merge the material into a video contract. “We all carry portable devices that are always connected and have highly sophisticated tech,”  . “This allows for entirely new kinds of services, and I’m sure there’s still massive untapped potential for new ideas.” This Finnish company aims to become the global number one 360-degree travel video hotspot, as well as a win-win platform for content producers and users, travel agencies and tourist boards. “360 virtual reality isn’t mainstream yet, but it’s headed that way, as it’s a great media for engaging people,” CEO  . “You can surprise people time and time again, because there’s always another angle.” Tellybean has made video chats more accessible and ‘as large as life’ by putting those nearest and dearest on TV screens. Originally developed with less technology-savvy people or late adopters, as the industry calls them, in mind, the Tellybean video call service launched on the Android TV platform in 2015, leading to co-operation with Sony and Philips and the launch of a TV app for Samsung and LG. “Developing on new platforms is always tricky, but I am extremely proud of our team,”  , after closing a 510 000-euro funding round in 2017. “We are now making Tellybean calls on new TV platforms and on iOS devices.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tripsteri-pockets-a-local-s-travel-tips/,Tripsteri pockets a local’s travel tips,"A ‘tripster’ is an easy-going, authenticity-seeking, travel-loving person. Something this Finnish startup is all about.  On a sunny Thursday afternoon in Helsinki, two persons who fit the above description are sitting in the capital’s new impressive library, Oodi. Travel journalists and  are staying grounded for now, keeping busy with Finnish startup   that offers an original take on travel journalism with the Tripsteri App, launched last year. Tripsteri publishes its own travel book series written by professional journalists who live in the destinations. It all started a few years ago, when a group of travel journalists for the   travel book series decided to set up their own website. “After they stopped publishing the printed books, we wanted to find another place to put out our material,” Valleala says. “And that’s when we founded the website in 2015,” Kultanen Ribas continues. But once the website was up and running, questions started pouring in: ‘If my hotel is here, where should I go to eat?’ ‘How can I find maps?’. “How can we answer everybody?” Kultanen Ribas pondered. “The answer is the application.” The new startup decided to take part in the Uutisraivaaja media innovation contest organised by Helsingin Sanomat Foundation and ended up winning the contest along with Finnish startup  . The 125 000-euro prize was a very welcome boost for Tripsteri’s growth plans, and, what’s more, the competition served as a startup school for the young company. “It was very intense,” Kultanen Ribas says. “And lots of great mentors,” Valleala points out. The Tripsteri team came out of the competition with an easy-to-navigate application that offers travel tips from journalists with local knowledge of the destination, as well as maps, bookings and immersive technologies. In testbed Helsinki, the app includes an augmented reality (AR) tour of restaurants and watering holes featured in  ’s films, and audio tours of both   creator  ’s Helsinki and haunted spots in the Finnish capital. There’s even a virtual tour of the city’s urban oasis  , a repurposed former abattoir that is now a self-styled “melting pot of food and urban culture.” “You don’t have to go personally to every place because you can go there virtually,” Kultanen Ribas says. “There’s not really anything similar out there at the moment,” adds Vallela. At the heart of Tripsteri is a belief in sustainable travel and avoidance of big chains. That’s why the startup promotes travel that is healthy and profitable for small businesses and local artisans. The Tripsteri App features travel tips, immersive tours, bookings, maps and more. “We are the kind of travellers who want to really get to know the culture and the people, and where the local people go and what they eat and what they make there,” Kultanen Ribas says. “That’s the whole point.” In 2018, the app was selected by UN-based World Summit Awards (WSA) as Finland’s most sustainable and best digital solution in the field of culture and tourism. The same year, Tripsteri also came second in  ’s digital innovation contest. So far, the Tripsteri App covers four destinations in Finland, as well as Iceland, Singapore, Stockholm, Berlin and Prague, with new destinations coming soon. It is available in English, Finnish, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese. The team behind the app comprises four travel journalists and two programmers, while the pool of writers for the website has already grown to 30. “Our crew is quite small but effective,” Valleala says with a laugh, “and we have all those journalists in about 30 destinations around the world.” As Tripsteri’s office in Helsinki is currently under renovation, the team is using the app to navigate the city in search of desk space. “We are using it all the time,” Valleala says. “It’s not only for tourists and travellers, it’s also for people living there.” And so, if you find yourself exploring Helsinki with the Tripsteri App, you may well come across one of the Tripsters hard at work at one of the city’s many cafés. Or in Tokyo and Barcelona for that matter.   and Visit Finland are both part of Business Finland."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-autonomous-vehicles/,Five for Friday: Autonomous vehicles,"The road is open ahead for Finnish innovations that are contributing to the development of unmanned cars here and abroad. For this week’s Five for Friday, strap yourself in as we put the foot to the floor for Finnish expertise in the driverless movement. Self-driving cars may happily cruise along when the weather is fair, but add leaves or snow to the mix and someone better take hold of the steering wheel! Finnish startup Sensible 4 and Japanese lifestyle brand MUJI are together launching an autonomous shuttle bus capable of operating in all weather conditions. “We are developing these vehicles so that they can become part of the daily transport service chain,”  . “Autonomous vehicles can’t become mainstream until their technology is guaranteed to work in all climates.” Any article about innovation in Finland simply must include a mention of the great work being done by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Back in 2017, we reported that the automated cars developed by VTT, Marilyn and Martti, have been road tested and are exchanging information with each other. “Today, the automation of traffic is generally speaking just taking its first steps – the big things will not come until 2021 and later,”  . If there’s one thing that Finns discuss more than anything else, it is the weather. Given the temperamental nature of Mother Nature up this way, this is perfectly understandable. Thus, it’s unsurprising that German conglomerate Bosch turned to Finnish weather service Foreca for help in developing predictive road-condition services for automated vehicles. “Wet roads, snow, ice – with our predictive road-condition services we alert to hazards before critical situations can develop,”  . “We are helped here by the weather data provided by our partner Foreca. This means an automated vehicle will know exactly where it can drive autonomously, and how.” Late last year, Peugeot selected Finnish software company Qt’s digital development platform for the digital cockpit of its new concept car, e-Legend. The car’s exteriors are inspired by the Peugeot 504 coupé, but beneath the classic surface hides a fully digital core that features an autonomous driving mode and a 340kW electric drivetrain. “As the cars of tomorrow evolve to adapt to the digital era of today, the driver experience must follow suit,”  . “With Qt’s technology, Peugeot ensures the digital cockpit in the driver’s seat is as advanced as the technology under the hood, setting the stage for the driving experience of the future.” Did we already mention the prevalence of snow, ice and long winters in Finland? Well, there’s more! With over 160 days a year of guaranteed winter weather in the city of Oulu, researchers found their ideal testing ground for harnessing next-generation 5G mobile technology to power a unique Arctic research and test centre for autonomous vehicles and machinery. Multiple partners came together for the project, including the University of Oulu, Oulu University of Applied Sciences and VTT (again!), together proving once again one of Finland’s other big pluses. “Collaboration between many different organisations is a real strength in Finland,”  , professor at the University of Oulu."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kombucha-is-the-good-guy-of-soft-drinks/,Kombucha is the Good Guy of soft drinks,"All over the world, modern people are going nuts over kombucha, an age-old fermented tea drink. Finnish company Good Guys Kombucha wants to give folks even more reasons to do so. If you haven’t tried – or at least heard of – kombucha, you were probably born yesterday. The almost ancient tea drink has aged well, and it has recently become so trendy globally that even Finnish producers struggle to meet the domestic demand. The company hopes to replace soda pop with all-natural do-good kombucha. However,  , brewing in Tampere, Finland, has its eyes set on the world. Although the number of bottles it produces is still far from what consumers would like to buy, there are big plans. “This year, we’ve invested heavily in increasing our production in order to automatise it is much as possible,” co-founder   tells. “That’ll help us to a certain extent, but after that we’ll need to boost the capacity even more to head further abroad.” Currently, ready-made and bottled Good Guys Kombucha is only available in Finland. The company’s other product, the DIY Kombucha Starter Kit, is sold in a few places in Sweden as well, but Häll and co-founder   believe there are intriguing markets beyond the two neighbours, too. No wonder, as judging by the press and popularity kombucha has been gaining all over the world, making your own kombucha may be the only option to get your hands on the drink. Good Guys Kombucha started out as a venture by the couple and a few mates. Katajamäki and Häll had grown fond of tea during their visit to Sri Lanka and became even more so after Häll and his friends started their   YouTube channel together, filming the origins and manufacturing of tea with Finnish tea companies. Hanna Katajamäki (pictured) and Krister Häll believe that kombucha includes all the health benefits of high-quality loose-leaf tea. Then, friend and co-founder   returned to Finland from New Zealand, banging on about kombucha. The gang decided to start testing the tea waters and started making kombucha at home. Long story short: with the ongoing investments and seven-strong team of founders, Good Guys Kombucha is a major player in the Finnish kombucha market, be it on the shelves of supermarkets or in people’s kitchen corners. The product range contains different flavours of the beverage, starter kits, and equipment for home brewing and loose-leaf tea. Although it might sound odd that the company is helping people make the product on their own instead of buying bottles, the good guys and gals themselves don’t see it that way. “The more people know about kombucha and understand what it is, the more they’ll appreciate high quality,” Katajamäki notes. “If you think of people who brew beer at home, they’re likely to drink high-quality craft beer when they’re out, too,” Häll adds. Kombucha’s possible health benefits have been discussed in abundance, but so far there’s no clinical evidence. Häll and Katajamäki emphasise that they don’t sell Good Guys Kombucha as a health drink or medicine but prefer that people notice its impact individually. “The best kind of feedback for us is to hear people say that drinking our kombucha genuinely makes them feel better,” Häll says. The kombucha starter kit makes kombucha super cheap – and enables endless creativity. On top of the feelgood, Good Guys Kombucha also provides its fans with a kombucha community. On their Facebook group, home brewers can share experiences, tips and flavours, as well as find help from fellow kombucha enthusiasts.   is, of course, also a way to enhance brand loyalty. Good Guys Kombucha seems to tick a handful of trendy boxes: a fashionable drink with quirky flavour combinations (ginger, turmeric and carrot in one bottle, anyone?) hailing from the Nordics (climbing in popularity everywhere) with a cool background story (tea trips in Sri Lanka, what’s not to like?) and a growing social media community adding to the buzz. Häll and Katajamäki are fully aware that now is the perfect time to gather momentum. And their vision isn’t a small one: to replace the unhealthy and processed pop with all-natural do-good kombucha. “We want to change the culture,” Häll explains. “People often wish things were different; we’ve decided to do things differently.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slush-calls-for-action-for-a-better-future-in-tokyo/,Slush calls for action for a better future in Tokyo,"Slush Tokyo brought together some 6 000 attendees, 600 startups, 250 investors and 300 members of the media at Tokyo Big Sight on 22-23 February 2019. Slush Tokyo greeted its attendees with a familiar shower of light and sound not long after a group of volunteers – a few too many for the task at hand – had scampered by the main stage carrying the last of the chairs and tables to their proper places in the vast West Hall 1 inside Tokyo Big Sight on Friday. The event kicked off with a welcome from Yuriko Koike, Governor of Tokyo. It felt fitting that the event kicked off with a doffing-of-the-hat to the hundreds of volunteers who had toiled for months, culminating in an intense 48 hours on site, to recreate one of the world’s leading and most recognisable startup and technology events in the Japanese capital. What sets the event apart is that it is a movement rather than an ordinary business or technology conference, according to  , the CEO of Slush Tokyo. “And what makes it a movement?” she asked the peppy crowd that had gathered at the main stage on Friday morning. “The crew! They are the people who make Slush.” , which welcomed an estimated 6 000 attendees, 600 startups, 250 investors and 300 members of the media to its fifth installation in Tokyo, is of course not only about the people who organise it; it is about kindling the entrepreneurial spark in people of all ages, genders and backgrounds, and facilitating inspiring and potentially consequential encounters between the participants. “We’re pushing the next generation of founders forward,” summarised Furukawa. Maxim Mai, the head of social impact and accessibility partnerships at Google Play was on hand. The event itself is moving in the same direction – forward – and this year made an emphatic call for greater social and environmental responsibility, borrowing the voices of  , the head of social impact and accessibility partnerships at Google Play, and  , the president at ARUN. Mai on Friday reminded that technology firms have an impact on the society regardless of whether they choose to have one or not. “Innovations can have the side-effect of creating powerful tools with major social impact,” he explained. The opportunity to have a positive impact, he added, belongs not only to investors and business executives but also to regular employees, who can shape their own environment and add social impact as a dimension to their workdays. Mai also rejected the deep-rooted idea that a business with a positive social impact cannot be profitable. “I don’t care where the money is being made,” he declared. “A lot of positive social impact can be created, and the ventures can be profitable.” This desire to have a positive impact on the society and environment was tangible also at the booth co-hosted by   and the  . , an educational game company based in Helsinki, was showcasing its new, augmented reality-enhanced board game that teaches children how different energy, food and transport choices affect the climate and their living environment. “The game provides a report on whether the carbon dioxide emissions exceed the limits laid out in the Paris Agreement,” told  , the board chairperson at SyraWise. There was much to explore in Finnish knowhow at the shared City of Helsinki/Business Finland stand. , meanwhile, has harnessed virtual reality to cultivate empathy for animals and the planet in an attempt to do its part in the global effort to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. “We’re trying to help people to understand what’s wrong in the world,” told  , the founder of the digital content studio. , the chief executive of  , was at Slush Tokyo with a product that is guaranteed to go viral: Flu Season, a mobile runner game that puts the player in the mucky shoes of an influenza virus that has to infect as many people and contaminate as many surfaces as possible in an office. “The game definitely has a teaching aspect,” he said, drawing attention to the importance of understanding how flu spreads. The Finnish contingent was focused around a large black cubicle that emanated a steady stream of exclamations of surprise and amazement in different languages, as those who dared to venture inside were transported virtually – and as sustainably as possible – to three well-known sites in Helsinki. “This is a snapshot of what we’ve built,” said  , the chief executive of  , the studio behind the acclaimed experience. “The reception has been great.” Other Finns eager to make a positive social impact were  , the chief executive of  , and  , the chief executive of  . Ikola on Friday delivered a convincing argument for a new food system based on sustainable plant-based foods that not only promotes human health but also reduces energy, land and water consumption. “Companies are profiting at the expense of the planet and human health,” he stated. The answer, he suggested, is to decouple environment from agriculture by shifting towards laboratory-grown proteins and controlled-environment agriculture. “Companies are profiting at the expense of the planet and human health,” stated Mikko Ikola, the chief executive of Ambronite. “If you can culture a bluefin tuna, you just need to get below 5 000 US dollars per pound and you’ll be a profitable business,” he stated, referring to prices paid for the critically endangered fish at Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. Suna, in turn, delivered an equally damning assessment of the healthcare system. Healthcare costs, he highlighted, are spiralling out of control worldwide mostly due to chronic diseases, a considerable share of which  , according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). “The healthcare system is waiting to treat you when you get sick,” he stated. “It should prevent diseases, keep people healthy.” Nightingale Health has developed a blood analysis service that measures biomarkers to predict the onset of chronic disease a decade before the actual onset, thus allowing people with a high disease risk to take action by changing their diet or exercise routines, for example. “You can change your destiny in terms of chronic diseases,” said Suna. The future was discussed also by  , a founding partner at All Future Everything, and  , a partner at 500 Startups. Liao on Saturday drew attention to what, for the present at least, is the biggest asset for humans in the intensifying competition for jobs against automation, artificial intelligence and other technological advances: social skills. “There’s a push to focus on what people can do really well,” he said. Bielskyte reminded that it is not only our actions but also our inactions, and not only the intended consequences but also the unintended consequences of technological advances – as well as their cultural context – that shape our future. “There’s no one future, only possible futures,” she stated. “You have to imagine what kind of a future you’re creating for.” Surely, a sound piece of advice for the next generation of founders. Hundreds of volunteers toiled for months to create a successful event."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-new-moomins-tv-series-has-a-gutsy-approach/,New Moomins TV series has a Gutsy approach,"Can a production company be idealistic in the same way as a cartoon character? At least it can try, says Marika Makaroff, the head of the creator of the new Moomin series, Gutsy Animations. If you’ve never heard of the Moomins, you were probably born yesterday. The internationally and famously loved, friendly yet adventure-filled characters created by   have been seen in all sorts of merchandise since the original books, comics and cartoons, ranging from  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   to you name it. Moomins can be found everywhere.  understands where the immense and everlasting popularity stems from. “The incredible positivity and faith in life, as well as their values, such as friendship, love, tolerance, courage and respect for nature, are difficult not to share,” she tells. She should know: as the CEO of  , the creator of the new   that premiered this week in Finland and is set to be broadcast around the world this spring, she has been working with the Moomins pretty much every day for the past few years. And she doesn’t even mind. “The Moomins are great to work with. Because work is such a big part of your life, it’s superb to be able to do something you truly believe in.” As with all huge production projects, the road that led to the creation of the new Moomin series was lengthy. Moomin Characters, the company owning the copyright to the entire world of the Moomins, has been closely involved in the process. The cast for the English-language version of the series includes (left to right) Edvin Endre, Jennifer Saunders, Rosamund Pike and Taron Egerton. The director, Oscar-winning  , has been on board since the early days. Together with him, Makaroff built a team and went through what she refers to as “colourful stages” and learning curves. “My background is in entertainment and drama production, and this is my first animation ever. It has been a lot of fun but also filled with challenges.” In addition to Box, there are various world-famous names  , including the likes of   and  . Such is the confidence in the series that a second season is already in the making. Despite many international makers, a significant share of the production has taken place in Finland. This is partially due to the 25 per cent   available to film and TV productions. Makaroff emphasises that with the help of the incentive, the series was able to tap Finnish artists, animators and musicians that would’ve been impossible otherwise. The production is the most expensive per-minute that has ever been made in Finland. Given the weight of expectation on the series, the pressure isn’t, as one can imagine, on the mildest end of the spectrum. The Moomins are a pleasure to work with, says Marika Makaroff. “Many Moomin fans are very active and enthusiastic,” Makaroff says. “Our intention has been to stay as faithful as possible to Tove Jansson’s original spirit, but of course we’re nervous to see how it’s received by the audience.” For Makaroff personally, it has been important to be able to make an animation in which the main character, Moomintroll, is non-aggressive, gentle and thoughtful. As a mother to a five-year-old boy, she has been disappointed to see how one-dimensional many animations are and how little gender parity there is. “We have various strong female characters, an idealistic main character and values and views in the stories that hopefully will spark conversations between children and parents.” On top of Gutsy Animations, Makaroff also runs Gutsy Media, which is a peace project for schools currently operating in Finland but aiming abroad later. Makaroff consider herself both as an idealist and activist – but can a production company be that? “At least we can try to do things we find meaningful and have an impact that way. Obviously, it’s not just running around in flower fields, we’re just as bound by budgets and time constraints as anyone else, but that doesn’t stop us from doing our best.” Gutsy Animations and Gutsy Media both have a couple of dozen employees, and Gutsy UK hosts a team of 15 to 30 people. Naturally, there are also the lovable characters to work with; but one must be Makaroff’s favourite over others, right? “To me, Moomintroll is really important. He is an idealist looking for his place in the world. It’s like my mentor says, Moomintroll resembles me so much that maybe the Moomins chose me, not the other way around.”"

Finnish proverbs, plastic alternatives, circular economy, education and healthtech ­– these are the topics of the most-read Five for Fridays we have published over the years. All languages and cultures have their own proverbs and sayings that can, at first glance, seem inexplicable. Nonetheless, the seed of wisdom they carry is applicable to generation after generation. These five traditional proverbs could function as reminders to business founders as they embark on the challenging – yet often rewarding – journey of entrepreneurship. So, wondering what Finns say to convey “empty cans rattle the most” or “greed gets you nowhere”? Check it out. Across the world, plastics make up 85 per cent of marine litter. In order to tackle this problem, the European Union proposed   that outlaw 10 single-use plastic products. This means abundant opportunities for Finns providing plastic-free solutions, including the likes of  ,  ,  ,   and  . Finland has been one of the most forward-looking countries in adopting the circular economy, creating the world’s first national circular economy roadmap for 2016–2025. Both big companies and startups have also been moving actively towards it in their business development. Circular economy practice in daily life, renewable energy from the forest industry, smart waste collection system, waste to energy and sustainable materials are but five areas in which Finns are doing great stuff. The world loves Finnish education – so much so we have published four different education-themed Five for Fridays so far. The country’s innovative approach to learning that transcends the traditional has been very popular with readers. Our second installment of Five for Friday has been the most popular of the education quartet, featuring  ,  ,  ,   and  . Finland is known worldwide for its leading tech solutions and its healthcare provision. The country boasts one of the most effective healthcare systems in the world, with many companies providing digital solutions to improve healthcare efficiency. Hospitals are also attracting growing numbers of international patients for demanding medical treatments. Here you can find innovations in medical tourism, solutions that increase hospital efficiency, pharmacy automation, healthtech devices and diagnostics and genetic research, and preventive care."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/customer-service-takes-pilvia-international/,Customer service takes Pilvia international,"We live in a world without borders, and the Finnish family-run company Pilvia is a testament to that. It has found customers for its WordPress hosting platform from as far afield as Latin America without spending a penny on marketing.   is not your typical tech entrepreneur. Besides a career in IT, Niemi has been an organic farmer, lived without running water, run a timber construction company and even built a sustainable timber house for his family. Now this same down-to-earth approach forms the core of Niemi’s latest venture, software company  . It is on a mission to simplify web hosting services. Pilvia enables hundreds of WordPress sites to be created and managed from the one site. “Our platform makes it easy to create and manage hundreds of WordPress sites with one account,” Niemi explains. “Instead of dozens of buttons and controls, we have focused on automation and created a very minimalistic user interface.” The platform comes with a human touch. Pilvia is a three-person company and its engineers have doubled as customer service agents from the get-go. For the B2B-focused company, this has turned out to be a trump card. “No matter how great your product is, what customers want is for you to be there for them,” Niemi says. “It is part of coders’ nature that when they are asked something, they don’t only answer, but tweak the product so no one has to ask the same thing again.” And these tweaks have resulted in happy customers. In two years, Pilvia has gained over 10 000 users for its free and premium services. A surprise boost came in 2018, when the company saw a sudden rush of interest from Spain and Latin America. Pilvia’s customer base doubled simply through word of mouth. Now the company is turning this early success into an internationalisation boost – with some actual marketing. Pilvia started as a passion project. In 2002, Niemi worked in server hosting and enjoyed it so much he began to build servers at home. Soon Niemi gained a steady flow of customers, including a few larger companies. But Niemi cherished diversity. Cue organic farming, pigs, timber and starting a family. It wasn’t until 2015 that he decided to turn hosting into serious business. He formed a team and launched Pilvia’s platform a year later. Our platform makes it easy to create and manage hundreds of WordPress sites with one account. 2018 turned out to be a game-changer for the company. As user numbers grew, Pilvia’s team moved from working remotely to an office space in Turku, Southwest Finland, and Niemi’s wife,  , became CEO. Pilvia was also granted Business Finland’s Tempo funding. Aimed at companies looking for international growth, it helps Pilvia to renew its service concept and pricing and – maybe most importantly – forces the company out of its comfort zone. “The Tempo programme supports us in marketing, branding and market research, which aren’t easy things for us coders,” Niemi laughs. Pilvia’s new skills will first be put to use in Spanish-speaking countries as the company looks to build upon its success in Spain and South America. Pilvia is also preparing to offer customer support in Spanish. “South America is a big market and English isn’t always a strong language there. Spanish is the second-biggest language in the world,” Niemi says. “We are also interested in the challenge that is the US. We already have users there and, if we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.” The expansion presents a new customer support challenge. But Pilvia plans to tackle this by working with local resellers. They will be supported by Pilvia’s team and artificial intelligence (AI) customer service elements which the company has started to build into its platform. In future, AI will help customer service agents by following their conversations and offering relevant advice. These moves are all part of Pilvia’s quest for ease-of-use and simplicity. “Search engines used to be riddled with ads. It was hard even to find the search bar. Then came Google with one box in the middle of a page,” Niemi recalls. “We want to bring a similar user experience to web hosting and customer service.” Pilvia started as Sami Niemi’s passion project and the family has grown since.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-ice-cream/,Five for Friday: Ice cream,"Finland consumes more ice cream per capita than any other European country. Here are five prime examples of the nation’s obsession with frozen flavours. Our   created such a buzz of rumbling tummies among readers that we decided to dive in again. What better way to the Finnish heart than ice cream! Get to know some exotic flavours, a tasty way to put a glow on your cheek and, well, a pretty unique hotel room! With a company name that translates as “Finland’s ice cream”, one is not surprised to learn that this company stocks local flavours such as spruce. A collaboration with Japanese lifestyle company MUJI’s stores last year in Munich, London, Paris, Milan and Barcelona put the company’s flavours on more lips than ever before. “Co-operation with MUJI has been an encouraging start to foreign markets,” founder  . “Even a small company can make it to the big markets, if the product is right, genuine and distinct.” All good things come in threes, right? The first three flavours from this matey trio – blueberry-cardamom, strawberry-vanilla and raspberry-white chocolate – hit the shelves in Finland five years ago. Such was their success that the company was inundated with flavour suggestions, chief among them a vegan offering. The resultant award-winning vegan chocolate-nut-caramel ice cream is the company’s best-selling product, continuing its quest for the finest flavours. “Our ice creams are made of natural, real ingredients from scratch, without cutting corners,” co-founder  . “We roast our nuts and prepare our sauces ourselves to make the flavours taste so real that they can be instantly recognised even if you’ve not seen the package.” Regardless of the subzero temperatures outside, we Finns know that someday in future summer will again be here – what better time for ice cream and cocktails outdoors! And, with our very own Santa twiddling his thumbs until December, it’s also an ideal time for people to enjoy both in one spoonful. “Bad Santa is meant to be enjoyed right after purchasing, and it tastes best in the sunshine, so terrace weather is good for business,” CEO  . This boutique ice cream maker had been eyeing the Japanese market for some time before it opened its Jymy Ice Cream Cafe in Akishima, Tokyo, last year. Boasting such flavours as lemon liquorice and naked milk, the company had previously established exports to Germany, Sweden and the UK. “It’s wonderful to see that our vision of a high-quality food product that is based on sound values also resonates outside the borders of Finland,” managing director  . If all this ice cream talk is making you weary, maybe it’s time to rest your head a while. Helping you keep Finnish ice cream in mind is this room in Helsinki’s Klaus K hotel. Taking its name from dairy producer Valio’s ice cream brand, the     offers luxurious sheets, a bubble bath, a swing and all the ice cream your heart desires. “We wanted to create a small, surprising experience around delicious ice cream,”   Valio’s ice cream business manager,  . “This luxurious hotel suite and our beloved ice creams are a match made in heaven.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tarvas-walks-a-mile-in-your-shoes/,Tarvas walks a mile in your shoes,"Finnish shoe brand Tarvas wants to help all of us explore the world with dry socks – never mind the weather. Let’s be honest here: Finnish winters can be gruesome. As lovely as images of beautiful, snowy landscapes on sunny January days are, there’s the other side of the coin as well. About five years ago,   and   found themselves wondering why it was such a struggle to find stylish and high-quality, yet functional, footwear designed to last both the good and the bad of Nordic weather. Keinänen had previous experience in shoe design and his own workshop in Kallio, Helsinki, so the duo decided to start playing with prototypes. Initially, it was a hobby for the weekends, but slowly and surely their confidence grew enough to ditch their day jobs.   was founded in 2016, and a little over a year later the first pilot launch took place. The idea is simple: “to create premium functional footwear that takes care of people on their journeys in life”. The style is “rooted in the design heritage and lifestyle of Finland” – including those who love to be outdoors in the winter. Tarvas is careful with where it sources its materials from and produces its shoes in Finland. Keinänen is responsible for the design of the shoes, and Lehtinen’s background is in marketing and sales. However, they both emphasise that, in a tiny startup, there aren’t set tasks or established roles; everyone involved needs to be pretty hands-on, whatever the job may be. Lehtinen notes that the team does as much as possible on its own. The materials are sourced and prototypes tested by the founders, and there’s only a handful of experienced shoemakers taking part in the production, co-operating closely with the owners. When creating Tarvas models, Keinänen focuses on quality, appearance and functionality. He strives for a style that is visibly in line with the company’s values. “All Tarvas shoes are produced locally and made of sustainable and durable European materials,” he explains. “We want to hit back fast at fast fashion manufactured in sweatshops.” Soon, Tarvas will announce a new collaboration, and the whole team is quite pumped about it. However, Lehtinen and Keinänen refuse to spill the beans just yet and refer to the partner simply as a cult fashion brand from abroad. “We’re really excited about what the launch of this project may bring,” Lehtinen says. Tarvas is owned by its three founders and four other, smaller shareholders. The core target group for Tarvas is adults with an eye for high quality and the environment. To reach out to the right kind of partners, Lehtinen and Keinänen have done their homework. For example, six months before the launch they travelled to France to visit fairs and showrooms and get to know some resellers, who then became the first Tarvas stockists. “On that trip, we managed to convince the organisers of the most renowned Parisian fair that Tarvas would be a perfect exhibitor at their event,” Lehtinen tells. “That fair then led to various deals with international retailers.” Currently, the main markets for the company are the US, the UK and Japan. Lehtinen believes that these countries also help boost visibility elsewhere. Tarvas is very interested also in nearby markets, particularly the Nordics and elsewhere in Europe. “That would make sense both logistically and in terms of the environment,” Keinänen points out. “As our footwear is designed and manufactured in Finland, it’d be great to see the vast majority of our shoes being worn by European consumers.” Whatever the future may bring (on top of the still-secret collaboration) for Tarvas, to its founders it’s all about the journey. “Our main goal is to work hard and enjoy this incredibly fascinating journey,” Lehtinen describes. With dry feet, it should be a breeze."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/do-i-know-you-hyeri-cho/,Do I know you?,"Hyeri Cho set out into the world with an open mind and a lot of courage for a 15-year-old. From South Korea to Finnish Lapland, she has made her way down to Helsinki with a story to tell, one of determination and self-reflection. Teenage years are filled with significant steps in a person’s life, including taking responsibility, caring about someone, making mistakes and dreaming about the future. More often than not, a young person has his or her plate full of new experiences to digest. Today’s youth may feel even more pressure in our interconnected and ever more complex world. One teenager, however, decided to take a look at the other side of the coin and strive for the limitless opportunities the globalised world also offers. Hyeri Cho moved to Finland from South Korea in her teens for peace of mind and to enable her creativity and true potential to flourish. Seven years later, she’s about to get her Finnish citizenship, works in sales and strategy at a prominent IT company and has been accepted to a master’s degree programme at Aalto University. Well, I was 13 when dad and I started doing the research. We had Germany, Denmark and Sweden on our list, and Finland was on there somewhere as well. My father was very open-minded and helped me with the process from the start. I’ve always thought that I have potential to succeed but began to feel crowded in South Korea. Like I might not reach my full potential in the competitive culture. I yearned for peace of mind and room to live and think what I wanted to do. At that age, one doesn’t even have to know specifically yet, but it was a strong feeling I had. Finland was an intuitive choice for me. But I did ponder on whether life in the capital would be too hectic and whether a smaller town could better offer the peace and space I was looking for. I also thought Lapland looked beautiful after seeing pictures of Rovaniemi. It fit right in with the cosy small-town vibe I was looking for. Well yeah, I was scared in the beginning and leaving all my friends behind was a tough choice. But I’ve also always wanted to study and work internationally. My father also encouraged me to keep my mind open about living abroad. It was a tedious process, since there was little information about Finland in South Korea. My father, who speaks fluent Japanese, actually translated a Japanese book about Finland for me, from which I could read up on the basic things. I also quickly realised that the immigration services didn’t have an option for what I was about to do, so my dad and I actually kind of created the option and proposed the necessary paperwork. We had to organise the host family and school stuff before I could apply for visa. We travelled to Finland a couple of times and actually put a small ad in the local paper to find a host family for me. It actually worked and was kind of easy! At the Lyseonpuisto high school, my dad and I met the teachers and the principal. My dad did most of the talking, but I also explained my motivation through body language and in English, which was not that good at the time. It was quite hard in the beginning, because I had to work double or triple the amount of other students, because first I had to understand the language and then the actual subject. It took about a year for me to be able to rely primarily on Finnish instead of English. One day it just occurred to me that I was speaking Finnish with my host family – telling a joke or two and using the occasional curse word. In settling in and building a life here, I’d say the people around me helped a great deal. People say Finns are introverts and, yeah, I did start all the conversations in the beginning, but once I got to know people they became lifelong friends. Yes, I’ve had more time for exercising and spending time with my friends, whereas in my past life I would’ve likely been sitting at the library or working at a café. But it’s also a mental thing, let me give an example. One of the most beautiful moments I’ve had is going out for a bike ride around town with my friends on a late summer evening. It was still light and warm, with a gentle summer breeze blowing. At that time, I felt very much alive. It was a very strong feeling, a feeling of absolute freedom and happiness. It didn’t require much; it was just beautiful in its simplicity. I completed my bachelor’s degree at the University of Oulu and applied to Aalto just recently. I was fortunate to get in since there are a lot of applicants. I’ve been working at the company for over a year, on and off depending on my studies during the semester, managing our sales and marketing. Recently, my tasks have tilted more towards sales and strategy. I’m fortunate to have a very good relationship with my boss, who understands my situation very well. Even though I’m in the middle of moving to Helsinki, I can work remotely. We have a very close and dialogical relationship – he’s kind of a mentor to me. What I really appreciate about working here is that I’m allowed to be myself. All you have to do here is show you’re motivated. I think people are also very honest here and don’t judge others as much as elsewhere. I know this might sound pretty obvious, but I don’t think it is in all places. It’s a programme in management and international business. I could’ve done it in Oulu, too, but there were more specialisation options at Aalto. I am really interested in learning more about strategy. I think strategy is my jam. I don’t know. Perhaps I’ll be some kind of an influential business lady-entrepreneur that rules the world! Naah, just kidding, don’t ask me yet. Well, first you have to understand that the hallyu trend is based on the South Korean search for perfection. Take the K-pop stuff for example, they want to get everything 100 per cent right; nothing less will do. It doesn’t necessarily come through for everyone, but at a fundamental level perfection is what it’s based on. So, the question to ask is, what is the Finnish brand based on? On a fundamental level? To answer my own question, I think it’s honesty. Conceptualising it is extremely hard, and I don’t necessarily have a ready-made solution at hand. But building on that fundamental, I think, provides a good framework to work with. I somehow think the Finnish mindset could be trendy in this day and age. If you’re looking for the more concrete stuff, I’d say education is an obvious but very true answer. And oh, if someone can capture Juhannus [the midsummer festival] – the calm, the authenticity, the nature aesthetics – then that! And Moomins. Definitely Moomins. Well, I think I’ve managed quite well, and I have a lot of loved ones and close friends to thank for it. Growing up in Korea in a very competitive and demanding culture that seeks perfection, I still haven’t been able to fully set myself free of the mindset. In Finland, it’s quite the opposite: the individual is accepted as they are. What is perfection anyway? So, if I could’ve begun challenging the perfection-seeking mindset already then and been more merciful towards myself, that would be it. I still struggle with it today. I’m my worst critic. I’d say it’s actually kind of the same thing, a perfection-seeking mindset. I’m very competitive. It’s a blessing and a bane, but I still would like to learn to be more forgiving to myself."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/happy-hour-skateboards-is-a-wheely-lifestyle/,Happy Hour Skateboards is a wheely lifestyle,"A group of Finnish lads embrace the freedom of skateboarding – and live it to the max with their own skateboard brand, Happy Hour Skateboards. Happy Hour Skateboards reaches out to all skateboarders regardless of age, gender or skill level. What happens when you couldn’t care less about trends? You may end up being the trendiest of all, by accident. “For us, our original style that doesn’t follow fashion fads is a quintessential part of our brand, as is our recognisable approach to graphic design,” notes  , one of the men behind Four Down Distribution and its brand  . Happy Hour Skateboards was initially founded in the early 2000s by   and  . At the time, the show was funded by another importer, but after some years Poropudas and Kempas decided to become independent. In 2011, Four Down Distribution and its founder, Kalaoja, jumped on board. “They had a renowned brand with a decade’s worth of history, and I was able to boost it even further with sales, distribution and production,” Kalaoja explains. Alongside being business partners, the men have a long history on skateboards. Kalaoja is also one of the owners of Helsinkian skateboard shop  , and he has been working with skating ever since he was 16 – more than half of his life. Happy Hour Skateboards has gained attention not only on its own, but together with some pretty intriguing partners. In the past two years, the company has created collections in collaboration with both   and  . Currently, Happy Hour Skateboards is being run on the side of ’ other businesses; the owners prefer not having the pressure to make big bucks. The first Happy Hour Skateboards x Tom of Finland collection, launched in 2017, was made up of three skateboard decks with original Tom of Finland drawings and topped off by a clothing line. At the time, Poropudas   that the collaboration was a tribute to the legendary artist – but not only that. “In addition to the bigger picture of gay rights, we want to do our part in supporting diversity within skateboarding,” he noted. After the success with Tom of Finland, the Moomins stepped into the game. Kalaoja calls the collaborations “the cherries on top” of their journey. “Right now, the most important thing is that the brand is appreciated, as very few skateboarding brands manage to stay relevant for over 15 years. The collaborations have spread the word about us also to people outside skateboarding circles both in Finland and internationally.” In Finland, skaters tend to be treated to fair skateboarding weather for only half of the year (that is, if they’re lucky). Thus, Happy Hour Skateboards reaches out to all skateboarders regardless of age, gender or skill level. “Right now, the most important thing is that the brand is appreciated, as very few skateboarding brands manage to stay relevant for over 15 years,” says Oki Kalaoja. Kalaoja has noticed that skateboarding-related fashion and accessories are increasingly popular among people who’ve never been on a skateboard. “Many people have bought our collaboration decks just as art pieces and for decoration,” he tells. Throughout the years, the company has had sales in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, but currently the focus is on the Finnish market. Kalaoja points out that the global market is very competitive, so making it abroad would take up a lot of resources. However, the collaboration with Moomin Characters brought about a deal in Japan, and later this year the collection will be available in the very Moomin-fond Asian country. Something exciting is cooking for next year as well, but Kalaoja remains secretive about the recipe. In general, Happy Hour Skateboards is headed for more surprises and exceeded expectations. That, Kalaoja believes, is a way to keep fans interested and the brand fresh. For him, the magic of skateboarding lies in the fact that it can never be “played through” and each day is different. “When I, as a teenager, got fed up with team sports, skateboarding gave me the freedom to be my own coach and make my own rules,” he recalls. “It also brought along the entire culture around it, including music, fashion and street art. I’ll be forever grateful for it, both personally and career-wise.” The collaboration with Moomin Characters brought about a deal in Japan."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/smilee-is-software-service-and-smiles-in-one-package/,"Smilee is software, service and smiles in one package","Finnish company Smilee wants to help businesses convert website visitors into sales by being in the right place at the right time with the right answers.  and his friends were baffled. They had set up a website for a rental cottage in Finnish Lapland with fancy photos and plenty of information, and people kept visiting the site – but reservations and requests weren’t flooding in at the pace they were hoping for. What was wrong? How could they encourage people to make the last meaningful click? “Had we been sitting next to the visitors, we would’ve been able to answer all the questions and address whatever doubts they might’ve had,” Karppinen explains. “We realised we needed a tool that helps us engage with the customers.” Yet one was nowhere to be found. Despite extensive searches, the team noticed that the only way to have the service they wanted was to build one on their own. “Our only option was to start coming up with a business plan,” Karppinen says now, about six years later, as the CEO of  , an international business chat service provider. Smilee CEO Teuvo Karppinen and his friends created Smilee to address a problem they themselves had faced in business. The problem Karppinen and his friends had identified was simple; and as they began to research the market, it turned out that other webshops had similar issues. “Website visitors put things in their shopping basket, but there may be a tiny thing or piece of information they want to ask or confirm,” Karppinen explains. “If there’s not an easy way of finding it out, the last step won’t be taken.” Whilst conversing with potential clients, many brought up the fact that even with suitable software a lot of companies would lack the human resources to actually discuss with customers in real time. Thus, the Smilee team decided to offer a two-fold service: software as a service with the actual service included, meaning that Smilee also provides the customer service agents that run the chat. The client promise is to convert website visitors to leads and deals. “There are many global trends on our side here,” Karppinen notes. “Online sales are growing year by year, and as today’s youth become paying consumers online shoppers will increasingly prefer chat over phone.” At the moment, Smilee is a market leader in Finland in the car business. Karppinen tells that the company decided to focus on that particular industry to gain market share, but in the future other industries will be taken on as well. There are plans to expand to other areas than just sales, too. “For example, waste management and circular economy raise a lot of questions amongst consumers, so we can work as partners also for other service providers than retailers.” After establishing itself in Finland, Smilee has started to take over the other Nordic countries. Its internationalisation has been boosted by Business Finland selecting it in its   programme, which offers funding to accelerate global growth. Smilee’s aim is to engage with consumers when help is needed the most. Despite the growing international presence, Smilee doesn’t plan to set up a team in each market. Karppinen says this is because the chat personnel consists of freelancers who work from pretty much wherever they wish. “We can train them from wherever as well, as all of our materials and tests are available in digital form,” he adds. “That makes our model very scalable, as we can increase the size of the team rapidly.” The core team has eight members with different responsibilities, and there are seven others in support functions. The founders have diverse backgrounds in, for example, sales, technology, customer support and the startup world in general, which has, in Karppinen’s words, helped build a dynamic team. In a couple of years’ time, Smilee aims to gain foothold in the Nordics and some of the biggest European markets, with car sales in particular focus. Whatever the market or industry, Karppinen says there’s a third goal on top of software and service: smiles. “After each interaction, we ask the client to review the customer experience and tell us whether their problem was solved or not. Receiving a five-star review will bring about a lot of smiles: the client will be smiling, we’ll be smiling and so will our client companies for closing deals.”  is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/swappie-brings-phones-back-to-life/,Swappie brings phones back to life,"Swappie was born out of an unfortunate incident. Now it’s a blooming business expanding the life cycle of increasingly expensive smartphones.  Sometimes a moment of embarrassment can lead to a flash of brilliance. For   co-founder and CEO  , it has resulted in a company that, in its first year, boasted a turnover of over a million euros. Marttinen was duped when he sought to buy a used smartphone on a popular Finnish C2C online platform. His money was gone, but the phone never showed up, and when he reported it to the police it turned out that the same person had been messing about with many others, too. “I’m pretty ashamed of the story, really,” he admits. “I really thought I could trust the seller, as we had mutual friends on Facebook, and I figured there shouldn’t be any problems.” The technology developed by Swappie is more scrupulous than that of many actual phone service shops. This prompted Marttinen and his friend   to look into the market of used smartphones. What if someone sold them it reliably? Could that help buyers and sellers – as well as the world by making people buy less new stuff and extending the life cycle of smartphones? It turned out that Marttinen and Heinonen were onto something with their idea. The prices of new iPhone models were climbing higher and higher, but the technological advances weren’t that drastic, meaning that old phones were still very much in keeping with the modern day. “It was pretty much by accident that it all came together for us at the right time,” Marttinen recalls now. “We wanted to change the industry and help people consume more sensibly.” In addition to building a marketplace for used iPhones, Swappie also created its own repair system. Now, both companies and individuals can sell their phones to Swappie, which will then repair them to make them just like new – but sell them for cheaper. “We change all parts that need changing, such as batteries, and sell the phones with a 12-month guarantee,” Marttinen explains. “In practice, it’s like buying a new phone.” The repair infrastructure is built entirely by Swappie, and the company has invested heavily in developing software to fix the phones as thoroughly as possible. This has, according to Marttinen, helped take quality control and management to a whole new level. Even many phone service shops don’t offer the kind of repair work Swappie has developed. “We can even fix many manufacturing defects,” Marttinen promises. Sami Marttinen paid a high price for a phone that never arrived, but it also made him the CEO of Swappie. Developing the system has been expensive, but Marttinen says there’s an ecological aspect involved. By repairing used phones, the life cycle of each phone is at least doubled – even tripled – which reduces its carbon footprint remarkably. “This way, we can make much more use of the devices than we otherwise could,” he notes. “Internally, it’s really important for us and one of the reasons we’re doing this to begin with.” Current global trends, such as the talk of the problems of electronic waste and recycling in general, are of course helping Swappie grow. The goal for the company is to be a market leader in Europe in the next five years – and not just in used iPhones. What else is brewing behind the scenes is, however, still a secret. From a two-man band, Swappie has grown into an employer of about 50 people. Most of them work in repairs, but then there are customer service agents and a team of developers. The company operates in Finland, Sweden and Italy, and at least a couple of new countries are in the works and will be added to the list this year. On top of keeping phones alive for longer, there’s another mission for Swappie: no one should be duped into buying non-existent phones ever again. “Absolutely no more embarrassing stories,” Marttinen says laughingly. “After all, it’s what started all this!”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/neuroflux-hacks-away-at-water-management-problems/,Neuroflux hacks away at water management problems,"Finland’s Neuroflux is utilising big data and machine learning to solve problems in wastewater networks and enable water utilities to reduce the waste of resources.  is a great example of a business that has turned hackathon innovations into successful business. The Helsinki-based data analytics specialist owes its existence to a hackathon organised in the spring of 2016 by the   (HSY). The participants from   and the   were tasked with identifying new ways to utilise the amplitude of data generated in the wastewater network of the Finnish capital. “None of us had any prior knowledge of water management, but we managed to put together a visualisation of multiple data sources over the weekend,” recounts  , the chief executive of Neuroflux. With two smart water hackathon wins under its belt, Neuroflux is confident there is demand for its expertise both in and outside Finland. “HSY was impressed and started asking us if and how we could move forward with the development.” The hackathon team were preoccupied with other projects at the time but continued the development on a consultancy basis a few months later. During the co-development project, the tool began to shift from data visualisation to data analytics, ultimately metamorphosing into a tool for identifying problems in the wastewater network. “It generated interest among other water utilities and software vendors, and so we started thinking about how to seize what was starting to look like a market opportunity,” says Koskinen. Neuroflux was established to that end roughly a year ago, with the mission of helping more utilities to reduce the waste of resources by providing analytic insights into water management. The demand for the tool became obvious as soon as the startup began talks with utilities about piloting it in a real-world environment. “It was great that we got to trial the tool with several utilities from the get-go,” says Koskinen. “It kept us grounded on solving real problems and gave us a solid foundation to develop a scalable service due to the various data systems and use cases of different utilities.” The system fundamentally detects hydrodynamic anomalies in water networks. Koskinen highlights that this guarantees greater compatibility and convenience as utilities do not have to install new sensors or modify their data to comply with any specific standard but simply ensure their data is consistent. We’re not creating a self-learning system for our own pleasure, but for the pleasure of our clients. “We can work with it as long as the network is continuously producing the same kind of data,” he explains. It may not sound groundbreaking, but switching to the automated self-learning system offers substantial benefits for water utilities. The system is capable of detecting leaks and blockages before they cause any major damage, facilitating the optimisation of operations by providing real-time analyses and identifying external water sources by combining flow and weather data – melt- and rainwater make up around 40 per cent of water in wastewater systems in Finland, says Koskinen. “All sorts of stuff end up in wastewater drains – hair, sand, grease, concrete and bicycles – and gradually the drains become clogged. There aren’t too many good tools around for detecting partial blockages,” he tells. “We are able to detect them – usually before the water spills over, but this also requires quick action from the water utility.” Water utilities have used the system to successfully detect a fair number of leaks and blockages, consequently saving hundreds of thousands of euros a year, according to Koskinen. The Nordics, he adds, have proven an excellent environment for developing the system due to both the abundance of engineering expertise and the fact that water utilities are willing to share data and provide input on how the problems should be tackled as they are not competing against each other. Neuroflux began its operations in August 2018, after trialling its analytics solution successfully with a number of municipal utilities. The system has also been adopted in Hämeenlinna, Kirkkonummi and Porvoo. Installations are underway in Rovaniemi and Vihti and preliminary negotiations with a handful of municipalities in Finland and Sweden. “But as a market, the Nordics are rather small,” acknowledges Koskinen. “Our plan is to start expanding overseas more systematically during the course of this and, especially, next year.” “We’re recruiting more people to make sure we have a solid foundation for growth and we’re ready for the international market as soon as possible,” he adds. “Because if it’s not us who go there, someone else will.” Neuroflux is confident it can claim a share of the emerging market also abroad, given the accuracy and ease-of-use of its system. “Because our service has been developed together with water management engineers from the start, it’s specifically oriented to solving their problems. We’ve been working closely with our clients this entire time and will continue to do so also going forward. We want to understand the problems, the data and come up with the solution,” emphasises Koskinen. The startup has already made an impression in, for example, the US. It was announced as the winner of a hackathon organised in conjunction with the annual Smart Water Networks (SWAN) Forum in Miami, Florida, in May 2019. Who knows what kind of floodgates this will open."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/do-i-know-you-verena-rentrop/,Do I know you?,"Verena Rentrop brings positive energy through sweet ‘micro-moments of love’ to offices and events via her company, Chocolate Angel. If life is like a box of chocolates, one wonders what cluster of confectionary constitutes working life. Lifting the lid on an average day and one is greeted with mounting deadlines, the strain of 24-hour connectivity and processes that often seem to be streamlined to the point of parody. For Verena Rentrop, the box of life remains one that is full of chocolates – whether at home or at work. Armed with sweet treats she sets out to bring joy to the workplace under the name of the Chocolate Angel. What first started out as a hobby, when Rentrop moved from Germany to Finland in 2012 it subsequently grew into a business. Smiles are contagious and, as we all wish to be recognised, these ‘micro-moments of love’ inevitably have a positive knock-on effect on working life. My alarm goes off at 4:15 am, which I often don’t need as I’m already awake. Then I play 30 minutes of online games like   in bed. I have had the same breakfast for years, including a huge health boost from pomegranate, which is my favourite fruit. My official workday begins with a daily routine at my laptop: sending positive energy via WhatsApp messages to 15 people who are dear to my heart. People whom I’ve met over the years in all kinds of capacities and from all over the world, and their stories. Being able to make them smile is both inspiring and motivating for me. In a world which is going more and more digital, I see a lot of disconnect: people inside and outside of the workplace are glued to their screens. There is a lot of pressure to perform, to grow and even to find a job in the first place. At the same time, there is not much appreciation for a job well done. Based on my own observations over the years, adding a little moment of positive attention from a ‘stranger’ is sometimes the absolute highlight of a workday. The effect stays for much longer, it often even reminds people to always stay, think and behave in a positive way. One day, I met   from India. He was in Finland for a few weeks on a work assignment. His best friend told him that he should meet me. He was quite sceptical at first. We finally met, I shared my story and he saw first-hand the impact that my positive gesture had on people when I offered chocolate also to his boss and a group of German students who were sittißng in the same café. We kept in contact and just the other week he told me that that meeting me changed his life forever. He started to realise that the smallest positive action towards others is not changing just their lives, but it also can change his. In his words: “I am now trying to help people by doing one simple thing: listening to their problems. I never cared before I met you… and this makes me really happy.” Back in 2011, when my closest work ‘buddy’   in Sydney and myself in Düsseldorf learnt that we will lose our jobs at Nokia, we couldn’t imagine a day without staying connected in the online world. For years, that was our way of working, with half of the globe between us. To keep the connection, we started the Facebook group. Next, I invited every Nokian who had become my FB friend over the years. Still today it is humbling that I was and am part of the seed which connects current and ex-Nokians from all over the world. To see the daily activities of the group gives me a lot of energy. Analogue means that every single photo counts. I work with 36 pictures per film roll. That is ‘healthy’ for the end results. When I look around the world I always see colours, they are always there, but when I use my camera the focus shifts to structures. It slows me down as I suddenly start to notice interesting details everywhere I look. Back in 2016, when I decided to start my own business, I was already living happily in Helsinki for several years. The connections I built over my 17 years at Nokia are all over the world, but the majority are in Finland. So, in a way it was a rather logic step to stay, to open my business and to offer my services here, but with my wings I can also serve everywhere in the world. Why not spread positive energy as a German from the happiest country in the world? It surely works for me! I can speak only for myself and over the years I’ve became more and more aware of my own punctuality. Meeting people is very important for me, so I make sure to come on time to show respect. If you run late, just let me know and I’m happy to accept any delay or last-minute change. When it comes to efficiency, it is really enjoyable to make the most out of every minute available of my day. A cat chases a mouse. The mouse runs into a cow barn and says to the cow: “Please put cow dung on me, so the cat will not find me.” The cow does the mouse the favour. But unfortunately the tail of the mouse is still poking out of the cow dung, and the cat catches the mouse. What is the moral of the story? Not all who pull you out of the shit are your friends, and not all who shit on you are your enemies.  Always take a positive approach to anything you do, work together and support people towards a positive outcome."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/for-terramonitor-the-sky-is-not-the-limit/,"For Terramonitor, the sky is (not) the limit","Using up-to-date satellite data and advanced AI, this Finnish firm allows companies to turn geographical information into actionable insights. Google Maps. Apple Maps. OpenStreetMap. There is no shortage of free web maps these days. “We make the data valuable by giving it meaning,” says CEO Joni Norppa. These may be practical tools for a lot of use cases, but if your needs go beyond figuring out how to get from A to B the free web maps soon reveal their shortcomings. The most obvious limitation: their map data tends to be out of date, sometimes by as much as several years. This is the need identified by Terramonitor. “There is a lot of geographical information available, but since it’s often outdated it doesn’t reflect the reality anymore,” says  , CEO of  . The company’s solution provides an up-to-date map of the globe by combining open-source satellite imagery with other data sources, such as aeroplane footage and field measurements. The bulk of the data comes from the European Space Agency, whose earth observation satellites continuously produce new geographical data. The firm also makes use of a state-of-the-art algorithm that allows it get more out of the geographical data it collects. Finally, Terramonitor packages the map data in a format that is easy to integrate into clients’ existing workflows. “Even though geographical data could be hugely valuable to a lot of people, many are discouraged by how difficult using it can be,” Norppa says. “Space data is hard, but we make it easy.” An important target market for Terramonitor has been the forest industry. For a Finnish company, it is perhaps not surprising that the forest industry is an important target market. Up-to-date geographical data helps forest owners determine the size and type of their forests, thus making forest inventory easier. Continuously updated data can also be used to detect deforestation and illegal logging. “In South America, for example, farmers sometimes fell woods without permission from the forest owner in order to appropriate the land for farming,” Norppa says. “Previously it could have taken months, even years, to discover illegal tree felling. But thanks to satellite imagery and machine learning it can now be detected almost immediately,” he says. “Even if you hired 100 people just to focus on illegal logging in Brazil, for example, they couldn’t do it as well as the AI can.” Another industry that benefits from Terramonitor’s service is agriculture: since the company’s algorithm can analyse optical images for information that the human eye cannot see, it can be used to monitor the condition of the crop fields and provide actionable information to farmers. The company’s solution combines open-source satellite imagery with other data sources, such as airplane footage and field measurements. Machine learning also gives Terramonitor a unique advantage in dealing with what Norppa calls the “cloud challenge” – the fact that satellite images are often obscured by clouds. Most solutions to this compare two images in order to detect cloudy and non-cloudy areas. Instead, Terramonitor’s technology makes use of a large number of images, and uses cross-checking and machine learning to detect the non-cloudy ones. In fact, machine learning and satellite imagery is a powerful combination that is unlocking entirely novel use cases, Norppa says. The company is looking at infrastructure and consumer behaviour specifically: analysing traffic patterns around shopping centres, for example, is likely to produce information that is highly valuable to businesses and marketers. Space has quickly become a burgeoning industry, but Norppa says that the hype around the field misses some important elements. “A lot of the focus is on launching satellites and producing data, but we think it’s also crucial to produce information based on this data,” he says. “We make the data valuable by giving it meaning.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/huippu-trains-teachers-for-global-education-equality/,Huippu trains teachers for global education equality,"Children everywhere deserve the best available education. Finnish startup Huippu Education believes the key to this lies in better teacher training. “Profound childhood education leads to better employment opportunities and higher education levels.” Teachers are at the core of Finland’s education success. They are highly educated, respected and trusted with almost complete autonomy over how they teach.   believes incorporating elements from the Finnish model can help to improve early-childhood and primary education around the world. “The glue [in all education] is good quality teacher training,” explains  , founder and CEO at Huippu. “Without it, children can’t receive a good education either.” Consequently, Huippu has made teachers its primary target. The startup offers Finnish-inspired teacher training, consultation and curriculum fusion for schools and educators globally. Each service is based on education concepts developed by Huippu and the University of Helsinki Centre for Continuing Education (HY+) and tailored to the culture and needs of each client. And these services aren’t reserved for wealthy schools and municipalities. What really makes Huippu tick is offering its expertise in all parts of the world, including conflict zones and emerging markets. “We talk about ‘education in emergencies’: It is something we want to do more and more,” Indrén says. “Our services aren’t only for exclusive clients but also for those in the weakest positions and most fragile areas.” Huippu’s approach has already landed the company its first major  . Huippu is working together with the New English School, a private school with students from 35 countries, to redesign its curriculum with inspiration from the Finnish education model. Huippu’s education expert   will live in Amman for six months to assist the school and its teachers as they transition to the new curriculum. Huippu Education was founded by Laura Indrén (middle) and Anna Eghaghara (left) to provide Finnish-inspired teacher training globally. Pictured on the right is Elli Heino who will train teachers in Amman, Jordan, for the next six months. Alongside the project, Heino will also take time to train teachers among Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. It is work Indrén knows well. A teacher by training, she has worked in humanitarian projects in Africa and Haiti and in the field of education exports. It is the drive to combine these two that motivated Indrén to start Huippu Education in the summer of 2018. Today Huippu has a core team of two, Indrén and partner  , and a large pool of education experts at its disposal. “When we start a new project, we match the needs of the project with the right experts from our pool,” Indrén explains. “It is also vital that we make the local system part of our education model and involve local teachers and the families in the process. We can’t take the Finnish education model as it is to any country, it always requires some level of fusion.” Partners are also crucial to Huippu’s humanitarian ambitions. For a small company to open the door to large aid projects, it is necessary to collaborate with other service providers and have references from the private sector. This is what Huippu is building now. The Princess of Jordan visited Helsinki earlier this year. Huippu’s initial focus is in Africa and the Middle East. They are regions familiar to Indrén, and Huippu has already completed projects in both. The long-term vision for the company is to build a global network of local offices. Huippu’s project in Jordan offers a good springboard for this. “The Princess of Jordan visited Helsinki earlier this year, and now we are discussing an entire school redesign project with her,” Indrén enthuses. “We already have several interested organisations in Jordan. We are very well networked there.” More private-sector projects also mean more humanitarian projects for Huippu. It is a balancing act, but Indrén believes improving education in impoverished areas will benefit not only the children but also the communities around them. This is what drives the company. “Profound childhood education leads to better employment opportunities and higher education levels,” Indrén concludes. “We have so much to give from in Finland. We want to achieve better equality and education for children everywhere.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-healthtech-investors-love-finland/,Five for Friday: Healthtech investors love Finland,"Finns take enormous pride in having the best healthcare system in the world. What other healthy characteristics of Finland attract the attention of those with their eyes on the prize? Leading investors from all around Europe gathered together in Helsinki a few weeks back to meet 40 of the best European early-stage healthtech companies at the European Healthtech Investment Forum 2019. Digital health, medical devices and diagnostics, and personalised health were among the most trending topics. Here is what you really need to know about why healthcare investors are keen to stay on the pulse of Finland. If you book a doctor’s appointment in Finland, you may notice from the title of your doctor that it is quite common to practise what you preach here – they can be both a scientist and a practising doctor. This results in progress where research and practice go hand in hand. “You have a lot of institutions, like universities, that encourage both medical practice and research and development,” said  , CEO at Ascend Capital Partners. “I find there are a lot more practical professionals in Finland than for example in the US; not only are they doctors but they are also scientists, which is very unusual. It is important because when you develop something you want to know what kind of a problem you are solving in real society.” Whether it concerns pharma or device development, the highly educated workforce and the availability of health data makes Finland an optimal choice for R&D. “Finland is the ideal base to do research,” commented  , CEO of the Nordic region at Bayer Group. “We have our fifth largest R&D function in Finland, and what we really utilise is the availability of health data. We have the health register dating back to the ‘60s, we have the biobanks, we have the openness of the whole society – not just the government, but the entire society is a very open environment to do research and conduct clinical trials.” The Finnish healthtech scene is very strong in IT and software, and there is also a large number of innovative medical device startups that concentrate on providing new solutions for different phases of surgery. “In digital health, there are a lot of interesting innovations coming out and we are monitoring the sector closely to see how it develops,” said  , vice president of business development and strategy at Medtronic. “We are looking for innovative technology that is proven – [and] so will have clinical validation of its efficacy – and then we look at what is the market opportunity. What is really key to understand is how is it going to fit in the existing workflow of surgeons and healthcare practitioners. Demonstrating the economic value of the technology is important, it is not enough to be just innovative.” Because the Finnish IT sector has been strong and cross-cutting different industries for decades, there is a continuous stream of excellent technology emerging from here. “Typically, when we look at companies in an international competition, the reason why we invest in a Finnish company is that they just were that much deeper, that much more thorough in understanding the problem and how to solve it from a technical perspective,” described  , CEO at Debiopharm Innovation Fund S.A. “Real data, deep knowledge and management based on the capabilities of the technology are the defining characteristics of Finnish healthtech companies.” The Finnish ecosystem of technology has grown steadily from the era of Nokia, and investors are monitoring the activities within it. The great track record in world-changing technology has required a lot of work, and one of the investors even suggested that the great work and innovations may be partly thanks to the cold climate that makes us Finns work more. What do you know? “Finland is the home base for great technologies like Nokia and Suunto,” continued Ascend Capital Partners’ Monita K. Mo. “You already have the place to create great technologies, which other parts of the world may not have. The entrepreneurs are more focused on the stuff they really believe in. Finland is also very friendly country with less stiff bureaucracy and simpler, more transparent regulations.”"

The phone interview begins a little late, as he had to take calls from both Norway and Sweden just minutes before our chat was pencilled in on his schedule. The next big plan for Leadoo is to have 1 000 clients by the end of the year. “If you think of a general hassle, this is it but multiplied by five,” he says laughingly. “What’s more is that we want to do everything 10/10 and never half-bake whatever it is that we do, so there’s plenty to do to say the least!” Da Costa is the man behind  , a Helsinki-based company that promises to “turn your website visitors into proper leads”. It does so by offering companies tools that make website content personalised and interactive, thus boosting customer experience and engagement. “If you think of website visitors, there are two kinds: active and passive ones,” da Costa explains. “The active ones have already made a purchase decision and they’re scrolling for information and comparing providers, whereas the passive ones are only just beginning to gather information and make their way to the site through content marketing.” Leadoo, da Costa tells, aims to make passive visitors active with chatbots, live chats, videobots and other tools and modules, some of which are still in the making. The idea for Leadoo – which was initially called Interactive Ads – occurred to da Costa when he was working in recruitment. He noticed that a lot of companies were investing loads of money and resources in improving their employer brand, but the return on investment wasn’t particularly high. Our customer satisfaction score is very high, and that’s the way we want to keep it. “It’s not enough for people just to come to the site and read a long article about the company,” he says. “They actually need to apply for a job, too.” To da Costa, the journey from popping into a site to sending an application seemed long, and there were no conversion points or calls to action involved. “After reading the article, the person would have to go to the company’s careers page, find a suitable position and then take the time to write an application. That’s a lot of steps to be taken before the expected result is achieved.” Leadoo’s tools help the company to figure out, with questions posed by either bots or actual customer service agents, what the website visitors are looking for. They also save the visitors the trouble of having to collect bits of information here and there on their own. The key clients include, well, everyone. “We have law firms, catering companies, recruiters, construction companies, builders and huge listed companies with various functions, but also SMEs, in both B2C and B2B.” Looking for leads? Leadoo takes you to them. Leadoo started out, according to da Costa, almost by accident. He was supposed to downshift a little after many years working in the startup world, but the idea just seemed too good to be left on the shelf. The first clients found Leadoo in August last year, and, since then, many new clients have knocked on the company’s door due to recommendations from others. This is what da Costa was referring to when he said the 22-strong Leadoo team wants to do everything “10/10”. “Our customer satisfaction score is very high, and that’s the way we want to keep it. Our board of directors and half of our employees are shareholders in the company to ensure we’re all committed to providing quality service.” Now, Leadoo is building offices in both Sweden and Norway, which keeps da Costa busy and on the phone. He’s keen to consider conquering the world, but not a moment before the clients in new locations are as happy as they are in Finland. Da Costa also has enough experience with startups that he no longer aims to be the best in the world. If anything, he has got a fair pinch of realism in his plans for the future. “If anything, I’m intrigued to see what our first major setback will be,” he notes and laughs again. “We’ve been going for over six months with no real issues, but with startups there’ll be something at some stage for sure!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arctic-security-has-a-secure-solution-to-cyber-crime/,Arctic Security has a secure solution to cyber crime,"This Finnish company is pioneering a new approach to online safety, one based on collecting and distributing critical cyber threat information, and adding a crucial element to the existing palette of cyber security measures. News about network breaches, data leaks and widespread security bugs are seemingly constant these days. As cyber attacks become increasingly sophisticated, it’s clear that also the defence measures need to be stepped up. As cyber attacks evolve, it’s crucial for enterprises to keep up, especially in the areas of automation and machine learning. ’s solution to network safety adds a new element into the mix. The key is tapping into the data on threat intelligence that various organisations collect from the internet. The company’s products gather and analyse cyber threat information from over 100 sources, and then match it with the owners of the impacted networks, allowing enterprises to take automated action where needed. Take, for instance, a machine that is infected with malware and is communicating with an external server. Or an unsecure service that has been inadvertently left exposed to the wider internet. Such cases can take months, if not years, to detect – all the while your network security is undermined. “It’s a huge list of vulnerable services out there that haven’t been fixed and can be compromised,” says  , CEO of Arctic Security. “And the bad guys are constantly looking.” Chartier emphasises that Arctic Security’s products add value to existing security tools and methods. “You still need firewalls, endpoint security and the whole traditional security paradigm. But when something does get through, our solution helps you to find that quicker.” It’s a huge list of vulnerable services out there that haven’t been fixed and can be compromised. Based in Oulu and founded in 2017, the firm is rapidly establishing itself as a key player in the field of cyber security. Last year – its first year of activity – it reported a turnover of over two million euros. In terms of funding, the company had a Series A round in 2018, and earlier this year it announced a follow-on investment by private investors including the founders of  , the mobile game developer behind   and  . The raised money will allow the company to redouble its efforts to expand its business outside Finland. According to Chartier, the majority of the sales already come from abroad. Demand for the company’s products has been strong with government customers, and now also enterprises have woken up to the rising threat of online crime. To meet this new demand the firm has launched the Arctic Node product, specifically targeted at enterprises. As cyber attacks evolve, it’s crucial for enterprises to keep up, especially in the areas of automation and machine learning. “The bad guys are already using these techniques to attack you. They only need to be right once to break in, but you have to catch them every time,” Chartier says. “You can’t solve automated attacks manually. But when a large amount of these incidents happen, it helps if they can be automatically detected and sent to the appropriate place for remediation.” Many companies perhaps still believe that their networks are safe if there’s no explicit reason for anyone to attack them. But Chartier points out that most businesses have some information that’s useful for someone else and it’s common sense to protect your assets. “Someone could use your machines and data to commit crimes,” he says. “But you don’t need to be alone in cyber, you can leverage threat intelligence to your advantage.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-footwear/,Five for Friday: Footwear,"Finnish flair for footwear is being recognised around the world. If the shoes fits, wear it, as the old adage goes. With that in mind, Finland’s fresh approach to covering feet is winning global appeal. Shoe designer Terhi Pölkki was 19 years old when her lifelong love affair with shoes had its first spark. She had always wanted to be a fashion designer, but working in a shoe shop during a gap year made her focus on footwear. After studying shoemaking in Finland, Pölkki was determined to do a master’s degree in London. Her own brand, Terhi Pölkki Shoes, followed in 2011. “What works for some might not work for others,”  . “There’s no manual or recipe for success – you have to build the road yourself.” The world knows about how Nokia connects people, but the company actually has a long and colourful history that has included excursions into rubber tyres and boots. When Nokia Corporation decided to focus solely on phones and telecommunications at the turn of the 1990s, these specialities became stand-alone companies. Nokian Footwear’s rubber boots combine practicality and design, and have attracted such collaborators as  , known for her shoe brand  . “Everyone knows that Nokian Footwear’s boots are high quality and have good master plugs. Already as small children, we are taught that they last a lifetime,”   in 2014. Helsinki-based boutique shoemaker  is looking to bring together the best of two worlds: the comfort of bespoke shoes and the flair of street footwear. However, he is not intent on building a shoe empire, but rather on pursuing smart growth by continuing to put quality first. “Our biggest challenge is to get people to try on our shoes, because often it’s easy to tell that they can feel the difference on their feet – as it shows on their face,”  The origins of this custom insoles company go back to founder  ’s background as a physiotherapist specialised in podiatry. He observed that patients were willing to pay hundreds of euros for custom insoles and wait for them for up to three weeks. “I realised that if we could make an insole that would be at least as good, but quicker and cheaper to make, there would be a huge market for it – not only in Finland but internationally,”  . It takes less than 10 minutes to analyse and produce the moulded insoles. Unsurprisingly the company is gathering speed: 90 per cent of its sales come from abroad. This internationally recognised Finnish footwear and accessories designer has held numerous positions with top-tier, international fashion labels and consulted with numerous brands such as Finnish footwear heritage brand Lahtiset. “In addition, he directs his own London-based label of shoes, handbags and accessories,”  , “including the first bag collection to allow wireless communication between the bag and smartphones via a near-field communication microscopic tag.”"

Dutchman   has fallen in love with many things Finnish. Firstly, it was his girlfriend; then, it was mushroom-picking with her in the woods. All Helsieni growkits are made of recycled materials. “It’s like a treasure hunt!” he exclaims. “It combines a recreational activity in nature with finding your own food, which is always satisfying. There’s so much to learn, too, as when you get to know one species, you’ll learn how to recognise another, and then another.” Finland’s so-called   allow anyone and everyone to pick mushrooms and berries in the wild, which Holtslag immensely enjoys. However, he’s also aware that not everyone who likes mushrooms is, for whatever reason, able to go picking themselves. (For example, not knowing what to pick could lead to stomach bugs or possibly something a lot worse!) Foraging in Finland is also a season-specific hobby, as in the winter the best mushroom spots are covered in snow. Thus, Holtslag contacted some folks back in his native Netherlands, who introduced him to an intriguing concept: growing mushrooms in coffee waste at home. He travelled to study the idea with them and returned to Finland with a business idea. Soon enough, he convinced   to jump on as a co-founder, and   was set up. Now, the company sells kits that enable people to grow mushrooms at home from their own coffee grounds – which are aplenty in Finland, as the country is known for the highest coffee consumption per capita in the world. It’s not quite what Holtslag studied – industrial design engineering and industrial ecology – but it’s very close. “And I wanted to something practical with circular economy anyway. Mushrooms and coffee sound pretty practical.” Helsieni farms its mushrooms inside shipping containers. On top of selling the growkits and mushroom spawn, Helsieni also provides Helsinkian restaurants with fresh mushrooms. The spawn comes from the Netherlands. Most of the growkits are shipped domestically, although sometimes orders do come in from the neighbouring countries and as far as Germany and France. Helsieni doesn’t plan to internationalise its sales as much as it does the idea. “We want to encourage local entrepreneurs, so we’re happy to receive them here and help them get started,” Holtslag explains. “It’s really not rocket science. We’re strong believers in the open-source philosophy, and we ship our knowledge internationally.” Another not-so-rocket-science thing Helsieni is working on is creating a low-tech and low-cost modular alternative to industrial mushroom production. Currently, investing in mushroom equipment is costly, whereas Helsieni’s idea makes it possible to increase production module by module. This would, in the company’s vision, give many more people a chance to grow their own mushrooms. Helsieni is also hitting a trendy nail in the head. Holtslag points out that as mushrooms are a highly perishable product, mushrooms shipped from abroad aren’t at their best as they arrive in our kitchens. These days, people are paying more and more attention to what they’re eating, where it comes from, and how fresh and clean it is. “There’s definitely a big trend towards more plant-based diets, too, so vegetarians and vegans are part of it. People also want to reduce their environmental footprints, and food miles are an issue as well.” Holtslag believes that home-grown mushrooms are thus in many ways superior to the ones we buy in supermarkets. The many benefits of mushrooms – on top of the fresh air he gets picking them – convinced him as he got used to his trips to the Finnish forests. “Mushrooms are very nutritious, and they’re also really interesting as they’re not really plants but not animals either.” Unsurprisingly, Holtslag’s own diet includes plenty of mushrooms in different forms. Currently his favourites are Asian-style soups with Helsieni oyster mushrooms. Hang on – aren’t mushrooms already coming out of your ears? “Absolutely not!” he notes firmly with zero hesitation in his voice. Co-foudner Stéphane Poirié inspects their handiwork."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/coplays-makes-practice-perfect/,CoPlays makes practice perfect,"Technology? Rational. Sports? Passionate. So how do you combine the two? Finnish company CoPlays’ coaching platform could be the answer for both top professional clubs and grass-roots volunteers doing it just for the love of the sport. In junior sports, the club usually runs on volunteer work with limited resources. It’s not unusual for the coach to arrive at the facility after their day job 10 minutes before the practice and attempt to brief the assistant coaches and players on the day’s practice. This was exactly the problem   set out to solve a little over 24 months ago. Markus Kauppinen is basically Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill from Moneyball put into one – a former professional athlete and IT expert. The CoPlays crew developed a coaching platform that enables the planning and sharing of practice drills, team communication and individual feedback in ice hockey, football, floorball and basketball. “The idea was to help coaches to make better drills and give individual feedback to players,” says CEO  . “The players and coaching staff would communicate better and make the most of the expensive ice time and practice in general.” However, as often happens in sports, the game plan couldn’t be channelled into gameplay without challenges. Kauppinen’s team hit a hurdle when hoping to get digital input from coaches. “We quickly realised that when you’re building a platform for grass-roots clubs, it should be made as easy as possible in terms of both content and the user interface,” explains Kauppinen. “Otherwise it just means more work for the already time-deprived volunteers running the clubs.” When it all looked grim, Kauppinen and his team kept working on their platform with the initial idea, or game plan, in mind. What was beginning to look like an insurmountable hurdle turned into an unanticipated new opportunity. Fast forward to   – the Slush side-event for sports technology – in rainy Helsinki in the spring of 2018. Kauppinen was hosting CoPlays’ stand at the event that brought together the biggest sports tech companies from the Nordics and even Europe. He was about to throw in the towel after two uneventful days but thought he should give it one more shot. Kauppinen went up to the keynote speaker and asked the speaker to give his two cents on their solution. “He ended up getting really excited about the solution and, after one thing had led to another, we signed a deal with his organisation in the autumn,” Kauppinen tells. The keynote speaker was  , the head of knowledge and innovation at FC Barcelona’s Barca Innovation Hub. Suddenly, Kauppinen   with one of the biggest and most renowned football academies in the world. Today, CoPlays is integrating FC Barcelona’s methodology into its platform. “Of course, with an organisation of this size, everything takes time and there’s a lot to take into consideration,” says Kauppinen. CoPlays stumbled into an opportunity of a lifetime at the sports technology event Smash in 2018. “What we’re essentially doing is building Barca’s coaching model into our platform – deciding what to measure and which kinds of features to include. You know, the club’s game philosophy.” 2019 is set to be a crucial year for the CoPlays crew. “We should be up and running when the season starts in July and the first trials are set for March and April, when we’ll get together with the coaches, test out the platform and gather feedback.” CoPlays and FC Barcelona have agreed that they will sell the finished platform, along with the club’s methodology, in the future to interested parties. “Barca is one of the pioneers in sports technology,” says Kauppinen. “They’re fully involved with IoT and data-gathering in the whole academy. They have this beautiful idea of technology, where they’re willing to let people around the world use their methodology in coaching.” “What we’re trying to do is offer regular grass-roots clubs the digital tools to enhance their practice.” Although a very important chapter in CoPlays’ young story, FC Barcelona isn’t everything. The platform is currently being used in 20 countries by over 1 750 teams. “We’ve kind of changed our tactic along the way. Starting from the bottom-up and facing the challenges we did, we’re taking the top-down approach now.” Kauppinen says his team has never lost sight of why they got into the business: to help small clubs and offer a coaching tool that is beneficial to coaches and players alike. “Once we get scaled up and build more content into the platform, we’ll be able to help out grass-roots clubs with world-class practice templates and information.” According to Kauppinen, building world-class coaching content into the platform with Barcelona is the next step for his team. CoPlays is also looking for other professional clubs to collaborate with. “Remember the coach that arrives to practice 10 minutes before it starts? In the future, we can offer him ready-made drills from the best coaches in the world in a digital tool that is easy to use.” It turns out all you need to combine technology and sports is passion on both sides, and, well, someone who can merge them into a working tool. “If you’re not willing to create the future, you’re bound to follow it,” concludes Kauppinen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/miisa-mink-wants-to-redefine-the-rules-of-success/,Miisa Mink wants to redefine the rules of success,"Finnish entrepreneur and founder of the Driven Woman initiative Miisa Mink wants to show women all over the world that making mistakes is not that dangerous. When Miisa Mink decided to start a new network for ambitious professional women a few years ago, she didn’t waste much time overanalysing. “I’ve always been a doer,” the entrepreneur and author says. “When I got the idea, I just started writing a blog.” Mink’s approach clearly resonated with her readers. What started as a blog in 2013 has now grown into  , a hugely popular global “lifeworking” network for women with groups and regular events in London, Switzerland, Helsinki, Singapore and even Australia. Mink, however, insists on not unpublishing her early, unrefined blog posts. “Some of them are pretty bad, but they are there to prove a point. You can start doing things without being perfect at them.” “The perfection trap” is one of the things Mink wants to help women fight against. “When you look at women’s magazines or read about successful women in business, the stories still perpetuate a very narrow idea of success – that you have to be incredibly confident, tough and always fully in control to make it,” she describes. “And that is simply not true!” Mink herself has – by all standards – been incredibly successful. Born and raised in Finland, Mink has lived all around the world before settling in London, and has previously launched and grown start-ups including the famous   chain in Central London and international design agency  . In the next five years, I want our global network to have one million driven women. Whilst on maternity leave with her twin boys, Mink noticed that her idea of success started to shift. “There is so much more to good life than an important title or a big paycheck, and success should look different for different people,” she explains. Mink has always been naturally good at bringing people together and making things happen. Driven Woman was born when she realised she could use these strengths to help more women find theirs. The principle behind the network is simple.  Women from all industries and life situations can join a local group, which meets once a month to discuss individual objectives and goals in life.  The focus is on finding tangible solutions to move forward. “We hold each other accountable, which makes it easier to actually start getting things done,” Mink describes. The members of   are diverse in age, ethnicity, background and profession; there are bankers, life coaches, photographers, cleaners, florists and authors attending the groups. But the challenges women struggle with are surprisingly similar, Mink says. “Am I allowed to do this? Am I making the right choice? Am I letting everyone down?” Women are often programmed into looking for acceptance outside themselves.” Mink encourages members to move away from guilt, shame or fulfilling someone else’s idea of success. “First of all, there probably isn’t one right choice, but multiple possible routes to a good outcome.” Driven Woman is all about dreaming big, but also about setting realistic, manageable objectives to move towards those dreams. “Success requires a lot of work and time. It’s taking small steps,” Mink says. In its first five years Driven Woman has grown organically – women visiting the local groups have wanted to start their own group in another city or country.  Mink is currently busy building new partnerships and the network’s digital presence but her vision for the future is crystal clear: “In the next five years, I want our global network to have one million driven women.” Driven Woman is all about dreaming big, but also setting realistic, manageable objectives to move towards those dreams."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-japan-gets-finnish-culture/,Five for Friday: Japan gets Finnish culture,"The Nordic Fair brought a total of 30 Finnish brands to Hankyu Umeda Department Store in Osaka between 30 May and 5 June. It should not come as a surprise to anyone that Finland is in vogue in Japan. Finnish design and fashion have an incredibly devoted and knowledgeable fan base in Japan, while the Finnish winter continues to draw visitors from the not-too-distant country year after year to see the Santa Claus and witness the dazzle of the Northern Lights. As we all know, however, there is much more to Finland. The Nordic Fair, organised at Hankyu Umeda Department Store in Osaka, sought to cast a spotlight on the unsung delights of the long summer days, deep-rooted summer traditions and exciting summer flavours in Finland and the Nordics. Here are our main takeaways from the one-week event. In Japan, Finland and the Nordics are still primarily known for their cold, dark and long winters, while the festive spirit that takes over almost the entire region during the short summers is less well-known. of Hankyu Umeda Department Store     ahead of the event that the Japanese could learn a lot from the way the summer is celebrated in the Nordics. It quickly became apparent that the learning curve is not particularly long. The ninth floor of what is one of the largest department stores in the country was buzzing with excitement as visitors scampered from one booth to the next in between participating in workshops ranging from folk dancing to  carving – as if knowing that the autumn is just around the corner. The Finnish summer is not complete without a game or two of Mölkky, which made a somewhat surprising appearance at the Nordic Fair in Osaka. The increasingly popular outdoor game of skittles was presented to the locals as a game that is completely barrier-free and suitable for children and adults alike. “The hand-feel of the wooden pin is good and the sound of knocking over the skittles satisfying,”  , the president of the Japan Mölkky Association (yes, there is such a thing!), said, summarising the simple yet powerful appeal of the game during a live demonstration. “Some are known to need a beer in the other hand to find the right balance to throw,” he added knowingly. The Nordic Fair also cast a spotlight on contemporary Finnish craftsmanship. ’s award-winning craft gins were on display at the booth of  , one of the best cocktail spots in Helsinki and a pioneer in the cocktail scene of Finland. Owner-bartender   delighted visitors with his showmanship and ability to bring the best out of ingredients indigenous to the Nordics. Those who needed a shot of energy, in the form of caffeine, found relief at the booth of  , one of the trailblazers of the third-wave coffee movement in Finland. With a coffee in one hand, the aroma of cinnamon was irresistible and unmistakeable. Someone, somewhere was baking cinnamon rolls, a beloved staple on the chalkboard menus of cafés all across Finland. The aroma led to an endless, but orderly line, of locals eager to satisfy their sweet tooth with cinnamon rolls baked by  , the now-retired owner of Kahvila Suomi, a café that served as the set of the beloved film  (Ravintola Lokki) and was renamed   in 2016. Food, in fact, was one of the more prevalent themes of the Nordic Fair, which offered visitors a rare opportunity to enjoy authentic Finnish pancakes ( ), flat bread ( ), salmon soup and Karelian pasties. Finnish design was naturally also well-represented and – judging by the frequent exclamations of ‘cute’ – continues to enchant the Japanese. The classic prints of  , the colourful stools of  , the playful animal-inspired children’s clothes of  , and the cheerful bobble hats of   all certainly served as a reminder that there is much more to Finland than its cold, dark and long winter."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/i-m-blue-bottles-the-most-finnish-of-flavours/,I’m Blue bottles the most Finnish of flavours,"Yo listen up, here’s the story about a little… drink from the forests of Finland. I’m Blue is just as catchy as its namesake hit song from 1999 – and likely to be much more than a one hit wonder. Four young students are rushing to leave the school building just before the alarm is activated. Last-minute studying for tomorrow’s exam? Group work left until late? Vandalism? No: an international business idea in the making. If they don’t go bankrupt, that is. “Had we left 10 seconds later, it would’ve meant losing all of our money,” says then-student, now-  CEO   laughingly. “All four of us had invested 40 euros in the company, and the fine for setting off the alarm was around 160 euros. It was a close call to say the least.” It was late 2015, and Salo and her three friends had been testing recipes for their  (JA) Company of the Year school course. The task was to create either a service or a product that could work as a real-life business as part of their entrepreneurship study module at the local upper secondary school in Espoo. What was cooking in the home economics classroom was a refreshing wild blueberry beverage made out of natural and healthy ingredients. The only issue was that no one in the quartet had ever even made juice before. “Yep, there was a lot to learn, so it was a bit of a process,” Salo tells. The end result was 89 full bottles of wild blueberry soda, the very first batch of I’m Blue. It was supposed to be 90, but well, accidents happen. “It was a hectic time and we were in a hurry, so one bottle dropped and broke,” Salo explains. The bottles are no longer hand-filled in a school classroom, but that’s where the story started. CEO Ida Salo is second from left. Shards might bring luck. The first 89 bottles were delivered to local restaurants, and in 2016, the project was pushed further. I’m Blue received a few awards from JA Finland and represented the country at a European competition for young entrepreneurs, raising interest from abroad. The actual company was registered in 2017, just before the final exams of the founders. They had higher education entrance exams to prepare for, too, but that didn’t stop anyone from making time for I’m Blue; everyone was just far too excited about it. “When we started to plan our product, we wanted to create something that was natural, healthy and food, because we all love food,” Salo tells. “I’m Blue brings these together: it’s natural, clean and of high quality, and it also tastes great. It’s a good way of sharing what Finland is all about.” The low-sugar but high-taste drink can be used in cocktails, but it’s also a refreshing beverage on its own. Salo points out that it can be enjoyed with “good conscience”. “Some sweet drinks give you a sugar rush but then make you feel bad, because they’re really not that healthy. I’m Blue has a fresher and more natural taste than traditional soda, and the hint of lime adds a bit of energy to it.” I’m Blue is no longer bottled in the classroom, but by a Finnish subcontractor. All berries are of Finnish origin. The founding quartet graduated last year, and now three of them have continued studies. All live in different towns and studying of course takes up a huge chunk of their disposable hours, but everyone is still involved in running the company. There are plans to create new, equally natural products. Orders have been coming in from abroad too, so internationalisation has already begun. Salo says that the company doesn’t target any country or region in particular, but instead throws its nets all over and see what the catch is. So far, the greatest interest has come from Southeast Asia. “You could call it a ‘divide and conquer’ technique.” As the founders are busy with their undergraduate degrees, there are plans for some recruitments in the near future. No one has thus far planned on leaving I’m Blue, though. “For as long as we’ve got the drive and passion for this, we’re 100 per cent in. Passion has been a big deal for us from the word go, and it hasn’t faded.” Wild blueberry, or bilberry, is a very Finnish flavour."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/myssyfarmi-s-tale-is-a-good-yarn/,Myssyfarmi’s tale is a good yarn,"A bunch of Swiss and Finnish grandmothers, a sheep called Bambi, the coolest beanie in the world and a career-ending injury have led to a new global fashion brand rising out of a Finnish village.  really wanted a cool beanie like the one his friend was wearing. Too bad it was made by her grandmother, so a similar one was nowhere to be bought. The only option was to make one himself. The world-famous windsurfer, with the support of local grannies in the Swiss mountain village of Teufi, knitted his first-ever beanie. It took about a week and the end result didn’t look much like a beanie, but it didn’t matter – they decided to call it a  , one of the Finnish words for the accessory. The knitting is done by local ladies. “It’s still on display in the very café where Janne created it together with the ladies,” tells  ,  ’s   manager, or development manager, if you want to sound corporate. “Apparently, the following ones did start to look a bit better.” Knitting became a thing in Rauhansuu’s circle of friends, and he kept on creating all kinds of items from bikinis to ties, gathering growing attention. At the time, he was also contemplating what to do next: professional windsurfing had gone out of the window after a serious injury, so travelling around the world with wind in sails was over. Fast-forward: Rauhansuu is a father-of-four and husband, living on his family farm in Pöytyä, Finland. His wife  , who made a career in advertising in the capital before making the move to the countryside, took up knitting on her maternity leave, and   became a quintessential part of the family’s life. “Initially,   were just a hobby for Anna,” Jauhiainen explains. “However, after a few years they decided it was time to either go big or slow down.” Want to guess what happened? Hint number one: Jauhiainen sounds a little tired over the phone, because she’s just come back from the Paris Fashion Week. Cuddling one of Myssyfarmi’s sheep offers a relaxing break to a working day at the farm. Some of the wool for Myssyfarmi   comes from the sheep at the Rauhansuus’ farm, known by names such as Bambi, Susi and Onni. With Myssyfarmi’s growing popularity, the neighbouring farm with its over 1 000 Finnsheep has come to help. The wool from Finnsheep is very soft, dense and light. Jauhiainen also points out that as the yarn has lanoline in it, it feels super soft and comfortable against the wearer’s skin. In addition to the organic wool, the colours come from nature: no artificial dye is used. “Everything is traceable,” Jauhiainen mentions. “We can almost name the sheep behind each  .” On top of the traditional  , Myssyfarmi’s selection includes other headwear and scarves. Each item carries the name of its maker. As Janne Rauhansuu has other responsibilities at the farm, these days the knitting is done by local ladies. They go by the name  , beanie grannies. Today,   are for sale in 13 countries through around 50 resellers and worldwide on Myssyfarmi’s online store. Myssyfarmi’s selection also includes ties and scarves. The German market, in particular, has proven fruitful for the company, but Japan and South Korea are increasingly keen to get their   on, too. Jauhiainen believes that the transparent traceability, organic production and lifetime warranty are all-important things to Myssyfarmi’s customers. “The world is full of all kinds of hats and beanies,” she says. “We believe that wearing a   is not just about covering your head – it also carries our values and ideology, meaning no industrial mass production.” The lifetime warranty is part of the brand.   never go out of fashion. “Instead of fast fashion, we’re promoting slow fashion,” Jauhiainen describes. “It’s evident that a lot of people are starting to get bored of mass consumption and just shopping for the sake of it. With our warranty, we encourage folks to think about their choices and move towards sustainable design.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/saana-ja-olli-lasts-seasons/,Saana ja Olli lasts through seasons,"Finnish designer couple Olli Sallinen and Saana Sipilä have created their own brand to reflect the values they wish to see take over the global textile industry. Sallinen and Sipilä want their collections to go well with each other, so that they stand the test of time. When Saana Sipilä and Olli Sallinen were moving into a new flat as students about a decade ago, they decided it was time to update some of their interior textiles. Unfortunately, everything made of sustainable and recycled materials would’ve made their home look like a house for hippies. “It seemed like almost all ecological products had been coloured to suit a carnival,” Sipilä says. “We were hoping for something much more Nordic.” Luckily, both Sipilä and Sallinen were studying textile design. They didn’t sit on their ideas: the first cushion collection was launched in 2009, when neither had yet graduated. This took the couple to an entrepreneurship programme, and in 2011, with fresh degrees in hand,   (  meaning ‘and’ in English) became their full-time job. Although Sipilä and Sallinen do freelance work for other brands both alone and together, Saana ja Olli is their heartfelt passion. Sallinen points out that in order to ensure a good night’s sleep, they are picky about with whom they agree to collaborate. “We only work with companies that share our values: sustainability, high quality and design that lasts despite continuous use and changing trends and seasons,” Sipilä explains. “With Saana ja Olli we are fully in charge of what materials are used, where and how the products are manufactured and what the end result looks like,” Sallinen adds. “That’s how we want it to be, and at the same time, we want to show other designers that it’s possible to stick to your values. In our dream world Saana ja Olli would not have 1 000 employees, but there would be 1 000 small independent design companies like Saana ja Olli.” Working together comes easily for the designers. Saana ja Olli’s choice of material is 100 per cent hemp. The couple praises the plant’s qualities, particularly in comparison to mass-produced cotton. “Hemp just gets better with time, as washing and using it will just make it softer and softer,” Sipilä notes. “The fibre is sturdy, so the fabric stays in shape.” Sipilä and Sallinen had to turn into detectives to find a place where making 100 per cent hemp fabric was possible. Now, all of Saana ja Olli’s fabric is produced at the nearest available location, the border between Romania and Hungary. Printing is done in Finland, as is sewing. “For us it’s crucial not to hide any production phases,” Sallinen emphasises. “Each product tag tells the item’s life cycle from start to finish, which goes against the conventions of the industry.” As Saana ja Olli is a result of two pairs of hands, both designers get to have a say in the final version. Usually the result is a somewhat minimalistic yet large pattern that draws inspiration from Nordic folklore and earthy colours. The couple have been together for almost 14 years. Hence, it’s not always necessary to even use words. Once it’s done, it’s done. A feast for the senses. “First we both do sketches and drafts, and then we compare and combine them,” Sallinen describes. “Then we see which bits fall into place – and almost hear the ‘click’.” When it comes to the less design-related aspects of entrepreneurship, tasks are divided according to personal interest. “My average grade in maths was 5 (out of 10) and Saana’s was 10, so it’s pretty obvious which one deals with numbers,” Sallinen tells, laughingly. The numbers are on the increase. Japan has been a particularly fruitful market for Saana ja Olli, with several resellers and collaborations. South Korea, China and Taiwan have a keen interest in Nordic design, too. Boosting the international presence of the brand isn’t the only project Sipilä and Sallinen are working on. Together with another couple, they’re also renovating an old school on the riverside in the city of Turku. It just so happens that it’s also the birthplace and childhood home of  , internationally better known as  . “When we get the ground floor fixed, we’ll soon have our very own showroom, gallery space and a summertime café,” Sallinen reveals. The duo’s designs have caught the attention of the Far East."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mwc-2018-5g-takes-centre-stage/,MWC 2018: 5G takes centre stage,"If you wonder what the future looks like, step into the shoes of the people who make digitalisation actually happen. You will find it will be smart, better than the past and, most importantly, full of 5G. Hype has different flavours. Among others, there is the intense and emotional hype of large sporting events. The Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid is a prime example of this. Finland can be a leader in machine learning, stated Nokia and F-Secure chairman Risto Siilasmaa (right). Another peculiar hype is the startup hype, with its bold and playful tone.   is probably the best place to feel these vibes. Then there is the hype that nears with determination. Well, this is the type of buzz at this week’s Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world-renowned gathering of the mobile industry held in Barcelona since 1987. For the people and companies who come together at MWC, digitalisation is not only about big talk or vague fantasies. Rather, it is mainly about practical things and concrete solutions that make it happen. For them, digital transformation is here to stay. Joining the movement at MWC this year are also almost 50 Finnish exhibitors – 27 of them via the Finland Pavilion, which is organised by  . “The SMEs we have here do not pale in any comparison,” says pavilion head  . A regular attendee of the event over the years, Marttinen-Deakins is also director, head of ICT Industry at Business Finland. “It has been great to notice how much value our SMEs can create for their customers and how unique their solutions are,” Marttinen-Deakins comments. “That is the way to stand out in a massive event like this. Besides, the word ‘Finland’ obviously has a well-known prestige in the tech sector.” This elevated profile was apparent on Monday, when   and   chairman   visited the pavilion, highlighting Finland’s potential with new technologies. “We in Europe should move faster with machine learning,” Siilasmaa said in his keynote. “Finland can be the leader during the process.” Annual attendance at the event is generally more than 100 000 people. In the weeks leading up to MWC, there was a lot of discussion about the featured topics and themes for this year’s event.   that AI would steal the show. Certainly, AI is one of the major buzzes across the hallways; however, it feels like 5G is the overriding theme for today. More or less everyone has something to say about it, ranging from industry specific keynotes to wild demos, such as the Japanese telco company NTT and their combination of robotics, 5G and VR. And one cannot really blame them. 5G will deliver speeds that are approximately 10 times faster than the current 4G. Meanwhile, whilst a 4G network currently boasts latency that is roughly half of that of a 3G network, 5G would be even lower still. Most importantly, higher speeds and decreased latency enable altogether new commercial applications. These will be the common denominators for the likes of VR, large scale IoT and autonomous driving. In a way, 5G is the technology behind all the cool stuff. One needs 5G first; everything else comes after that. According to  , who works as a senior scientist at   and is coordinating the   activities, we are starting to see the emergence of the first phase of 5G. “The first versions of the standards are ready,” he says. “This will mean an increasing volume of pre-commercial pilots and roll outs. In the first phase, the emphasis will be on higher data speeds and new frequency ranges.” Nevertheless, this is just the beginning. “It only covers a thin slide of all the potential with 5G,” Pinola adds. “One could roughly say that the ultra-reliable low latency connections and energy-efficient connectivity for massive amounts of IoT devices are still in the making. We will have to wait for these in the years to come.” Finnish company Anaxeos proved that wearables are not just for humans, but also dogs such as Pava. The effects of 5G are not limited to the tech itself, its performance or functions. At MWC, one clearly senses that a huge transformation is taking place in the traditional mobile industry and its subsequent business models. All the actors are searching for their position in a 5G world. “When you walk around the exhibition areas, you can see that the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution has already created a massive ecosystem of players from across very different industries,” says Marttinen-Deakins. “You have, for example, automakers and operators showcasing robotic cars and related mobility services. Similarly, you can find healthcare services in mobile operators’ portfolios. The game is changing really quickly.” “In this situation, our overwhelming advantage is in our size,” she underlines. “Finland is small enough to be agile in utilising the technologies in a most advanced and user-friendly manner across different sectors in the society, as the transformation only heats up.” A work of art. Japanese company NTT’s robot replicated the brush strokes of a human painter in real time, creating a perfect duplicate."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-things-learned-polar-bear-pitching/,Five for Friday: Things we learned at Polar Bear Pitching,"This week, the coolest pitching event in the world shined a global spotlight on the city of Oulu. Located 600 kilometres north of Helsinki, the city of Oulu is an innovative hub of great ideas and tech brilliance. The growing popularity of   (PBP), has seen the city play host to a range of side events and workshops, designed to further escalate the future prospects of the town. Here’s what caught our eye up north. The two-day programme kicked off with ground zero for VC investors, business angels and Oulu-based companies: Oulu Investor Day. Altogether, some 100 one-on-one meetings were organised between investors and companies, along with some inspiring speeches from local and international investors. “This is a place where positive things happen,” declared  , the director of economic development at the City of Oulu/ . “When people ask how are things in Oulu, the Finnish reply is, ‘not so bad.’ This is our [humble] way of saying we are actually doing pretty good.” Oulu’s geographical isolation is matched by a climate that is pummelled by the Arctic chill, seesawing levels of daylight and an often-soggy summer. Therefore, when the local economy teetered on despair back in 2013, there was only one solution. “With Finnish  , there is nothing you can’t do,” stated PBP founder  , referring to uniquely Finnish combination of grit, determination and perseverance. “Instead of hiding our differences, I thought that, ‘let’s turn it upside down and make it a focal point, the wow factor’,” she recalls. “We should put entrepreneurs in a hole, and in doing so they cut to the chase and make themselves understood. They have to talk in simple terms to get the point across. “It’s so crazy, we just have to do it.” Finland’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Development   was on hand at this year’s PBP. Actually, he was more than that, plunging into the ice hole to deliver a warm welcome, albeit in sub-zero temperatures. “I want to make sure…that we are an open, international society, we welcome all ideas, all entrepreneurs, all startups and investors to Finland,” he declared. This year, Business Oulu organised a media tour for representatives from the US, South Korea, Japan, France and China, that coincided with PBP. One of the many highlights was a visit to the  , where a number of research groups and spin-off companies were introduced, all in the midst of the university’s innovative space,  . “Here at the university, we are pushing the boundaries of the human world,” stated university vice rector  , hitting the nail on the head. Part of the international media tour also included presentations from a quartet of health-related companies. Whilst  ‘s wellness ring  , the trio of  ,   and   also impressed with their healthtech solutions. Near Real’s one-click service helps doctors to treat patients remotely, Spektikor develops portable vital sign monitors for emergency medicine and professional use and Nukute’s technology helps pre-screen and assist diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea patients and snoring. These are all in keeping with Oulu’s healthy approach. “There are more than 500 health and life science companies here,” OuluHealth’s network director    . “People in Oulu are not afraid of technology. If you always play it safe, you achieve nothing.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bankify-takes-the-social-leap-for-banking/,Bankify takes the social leap for banking,"This fresh fintech startup wants to bring change to the boring aftermaths of shared Friday dinners. Bankify’s idea sprang from the endless chats about ‘who bought what’ and ‘who owes whom’ and became a mission to make everyday finance fun. As new regulations widen the customer’s choice beyond traditional finance actors, a simple swipe has become all it takes to pay off your debts. However, when sums start adding up during, say, a group trip to the summer cabin, the task to divide costs becomes less swipable. At least according to   co-founders  and  , who, based on the continuous discussions about money in their group chats, realised there is room for a new type of social app. Their idea was not to compete with already available mobile payment innovations, but to cooperate with them by adding a new dimension designed especially to make the management of shared expenses easy. “Finance is often seen as challenging, boring, complicated – everything else than fun – so our motto is to change that,” Tarakkamäki explains. “We want to highlight that anyone can be a banker in their own community and that finance management can be a social experience.” Bankify’s innovation lies in combining mathematics and social media in a way that takes the group chat to the next level. The ‘banker’, who is responsible for the costs, only needs to add the expenses to the app, which then shares the costs and takes care of reminding the participants. “Or then you can choose not to pay off the debts immediately and become the banker of the next event instead, and in that way balance the costs,” Tarakkamäki continues. Based on last summer’s soft launch on both Android and iOS in several countries, these functions are especially appreciated among friends or organisations that have a continuous flow of social events. As a part of the  , the company has accessed this user group via the university’s students that usually have a need for shared finances. Thus, it decided to invite the students to spread the message to their communities, and at the same time get hands-on experience in the startup business. “Most of the universities invited to the ambassador programme have already signed up and now we are about to take the concept abroad,” says Tarakkamäki. The social platform makes sure shared expenses are not forgotten and offers a tool for managing saving projects. While the feedback proves that the company is on the right track, Tarakkamäki emphasises that the app is currently too simple to achieve the global success they are aiming for. However, with the fresh insight gained from the   last autumn, where the company participated in the Nordea track, new possibilities were found in younger users’ needs. Thanks to a major seed investment from Odysseus Investments Fund, as well as   funding, the app is now moving towards the next stage. “Version 2.0 will be ready by March, when it will be commercially launched first in Finland and Ireland,” says Tarakkamäki. “The plan is to then continue to new markets by the summer.” In this new version, the focus has been turned to the millennials that might not have the money needed to become the banker of an event. To solve this, a micro crowdfunding feature will be added that allows the user to gather the money before the event and also use the app to manage personal projects. “If you are in need of more systematic finance planning, for example when saving for a driving license, you can start a project on the app and invite relatives to be the sponsors,” Tarakkamäki explains. Bankify’s user-centric business model has heightened the company’s attractiveness among traditional finance actors. Currently the company is investigating how the new functions can be used to create added value to customers by linking them to more traditional banking services. “This kind of co-operation could add an educative angle about bank services, as today’s youngsters usually don’t go to the offices and the service needs to be available through digital channels,” Tarakkamäki emphasises. The startup has also made a conscious decision to use external partners instead of becoming a regulated finance organisation, which, for example, means that the app is not a payment method in itself. Instead, it can be linked to any already available service, making it easy to adapt to new markets. Bankify’s sights are thus firmly set on international expansion. “Our global vision is that the banker app will help millions of young adults to improve their everyday finance management in an economically sustainable way,” Tarakkamäki summarises."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/click-learn-oppia/,Click and learn with Oppia,"In this day and age, lifelong learning isn’t just a fun hobby – it’s also a necessity for both people and corporations in order to stay up to date with what’s going on. Finnish website Oppia.fi offers a source for better skills. How do you administer training courses for thousands of people with just half a handful of admin staff? Years ago,   and his consulting company Wakaru repeatedly faced this question from customers. “We didn’t want to have a huge admin team,” he says. “We train companies about ICT service management as well as project management and governance, so it would’ve looked like the shoemakers’ children going barefoot.” Instead of pairs of arms, Wakaru created an ERP (enterprise resource planning system), an automated process for handling all possible aspects of organising a training event. As clients purchasing training took note of the efficiency, Väyrynen started to think herein might also lie a business opportunity. Around the same time, he noticed that even big corporations were beginning to look for small and agile training providers. Petri Väyrynen With changing technology and rapidly increasing digital tools, more and more specific knowledge and information are needed. “We figured it’d make sense to bring both big and small training houses together in a cost-effective way.” So they did. In April 2016, the website   was launched. It’s a platform that combines the logic of an online store and the ERP Wakaru initially created for its in-house needs. Currently it operates as a separate business unit under Wakaru, but there are plans to set up a separate company that focusses exclusively on Oppia’s offering. Now, the Finnish version has two siblings: a subsidiary in   and a company with a couple of partners in  . Väyrynen points out that the training market, especially when it comes to classroom training, tends to work best when localised. For example, many prefer to study new skills in their native language. Next, similar portals will be opened in neighbouring countries. “From Sweden, it’s natural to continue to Denmark and Norway, and from Estonia, we’ll be looking at other Baltic countries,” Väyrynen says. In huge markets, like Germany or the UK, Oppia won’t establish itself in its Nordic or Baltic form. Instead, Väyrynen sees Oppia as a platform and technology provider for companies that already operate in the field of training. “Oppia.fi is a business case that proves that the platform works,” he notes. Oppia and its partners are a cheerful team of professionals. As Wakaru is a training provider itself, Oppia also functions as a marketing channel for its offering. At the same time, it provides the same visibility for competitors. Using the platform is free of charge and the money comes from commissions, meaning Wakaru also benefits from the success of its rivals. Oppia also takes pride in its vast selection of the content and various forms of the training it includes. In Finnish, the portal’s slogan is “Everything is here” ( ). “It might not be 100 per cent true right now,” Väyrynen admits. “But in the future, it will be.” Oppia wants to be sure the courses it sells are of high quality. Technically anyone can set up a course and sell it on the platform, but if it starts receiving lousy feedback, Wakaru will intervene. However, as an entrepreneur himself, Väyrynen wants to make giving feedback a two-way street. This helps transparency and fairness. “When we’re talking B2B sales, the buyer’s role shouldn’t be too strong,” he points out. “Just as the trainer has to do a good job, the company being trained should be decent to work with, too.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/myjemma-reveals-love/,MyJemma reveals what we love most,"Our loved ones are always in our hearts, of course – but Finnish MyJemma jewellery keeps them almost just as close, just in 2D. What if an accessory, like a necklace, could tell whom you think about the most?  quickly touches his smartphone with a   locket, and photos of his family start appearing on the screen. No battery, no charging, no apps, no cables; just a quick, light tap. “It’s pretty remarkable in my eyes, too,” Kallio admits. “The tiniest pulse of energy from the phone’s battery is enough to activate the chip.” The chip, located inside a digital locket, reveals whatever the user decides to store on his or her MyJemma account. The chip is a key to a cloud for photos and videos – like a modern-day medallion. It just comes with more privacy and storage capacity than the traditional one: “The cloud can be password-protected,” Kallio points out. “Even if the locket is lost or falls into the wrong hands, the files stay safe.” A MyJemma locket, made of sterling silver, is sold with a silver chain and a two-year license to the cloud. After that, the license can be continued for a nominal fee, storage size options ranging from 100 megabytes to a gigabyte. If paying for the service doesn’t sound tempting, the jewellery itself is worth wearing, too. MyJemma pieces are all designed and handcrafted in Finland. CEO and co-founder Marko Kallio The story of MyJemma began under what initially seemed like unfortunate circumstances. For over a decade, Kallio was the head of an international cancer research and drug development team, and medical biotechnology had been his life work. When the research unit was shut down, all employee contracts were terminated – including those of Kallio and his wife. “We were given the notice on the same day,” he recalls. “It was a tough situation, also in the financial sense.” The couple started to consider entrepreneurship as an option, and some colleagues from the research unit jumped on board. The group’s aim was to create a Gift 2.0: something that serves various purposes, isn’t a seasonal product and tends to not be affected by trends and fads. The first item was one-and-a-half years in the making. “It wasn’t just product development,” Kallio points out. “We built up a whole team of partners from subcontractors to designers, starting from scratch.” MyJemma jewellery, which is for sale in an online store and soon also through resellers, is targeted at both consumers and businesses. When it comes to individual customers, its appeal lies in the emotional value the digital content brings to the piece of jewellery. “For example, memories from a stag or hen do or a wedding can be collected inside the locket and given as a gift,” Kallio suggests. For companies, MyJemma provides a communication channel to reach out to and engage with employees, partners and key clients. The CEO can send Christmas greetings in video form, and later users can replace it with their personal content if they so wish. MyJemma also has a range of other business gifts that contain the chip and the service, such as key rings, pens and business cards. “Imagination sets the limits for different uses of our products and service,” Kallio tells. “We started out with jewellery as it suits both B2B and B2C markets, but there are plenty of other possibilities, too.” One new thing that’s coming up is a piece of jewellery that can be attached to an existing pendant. This lets people who’ve already found their favourite necklace add digital features to it. “Jewellery is primarily a design business,” Kallio says. “Nobody needs to buy or wear a piece of jewellery they aren’t fond of.” MyJemma is all about feelings, anyway. “We’re not measuring stress or blood pressure, as MyJemma isn’t an activity band or a fitness tracker. We want to be an instrument for increasing feelings of closeness and happiness to people’s lives.” The lockets can be customised with different colours."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/golla-puts-nordic-design-bag/,Golla puts Nordic design in the bag,"Global changes in consumer habits have made the Finnish design company change course several times – but it’s always stayed true to its original style. When’s the last time you saw someone dig out a digital camera to take a holiday snapshot? That’s right: these days, the vast majority of amateur photographers would just reach for their phone. Before smartphones, digital cameras used to be everywhere. In the heyday of the mobile takeover, Finnish company   used to sell seven million camera and mobile phone bags a year. It had products available in over 120 countries and tens of thousands of resellers. Awards were flying in from entrepreneurship societies and the  . Golla wants to separate itself from others by adding a personal twist to classic Nordic designs. Around 2012, things started to look different. “Cameras disappeared and all mobile phones turned smart,” says CEO  . For Golla, that meant that pivoting was inevitable. Fortunately, the company was experienced in looking into new directions. When it was founded in the ‘90s, it produced design gift items such as CD racks. Hand on your heart – when did you last listen to a CD? Hence, changing gear was nothing new to the family business. “A lot has changed indeed,” Kähkönen notes laughingly. “But the idea has remained the same: designing consumer products with a distinctive twist and pushing them abroad furiously.” Now, Golla designs minimalistic, Scandinavian-style bags. At department stores, its products have been moved from the electronics departments to fashion and accessories. As with the mobile revolution Golla was at the forefront of, the company has managed to jump on another trend. These days, even businessmen in suits don’t refuse a backpack. Commuters as well as students are turning to Golla’s classic designs to carry their daily necessities. Kähkönen describes the most recent pivot as the most labour-intensive so far. “It’s the odd life of an entrepreneur,” he points out. “A company that used to grow year-on-year had to take steps back and start from small again. Fortunately things have taken off again.” Golla isn’t just sending bags out to the world and hoping they’ll find a carrier. The company’s goal is to establish stores around the world, similar to those it already has in the capital region in Finland. “The store can be an export item in itself,” Kähkönen explains. “The world is full of products, so selling just an individual bag in Japan can be difficult. The concept of a shop is much more interesting.” Golla’s team members Joonas Pulliainen and Katariina Nieminen working at Golla’s home base in Espoo. Golla’s history includes the world-famous bean bag brand Fatboy, which Kähkönen then sold to a Dutch company. The next big step might be adding shoes to the selection. All design work happens in Golla’s office in Espoo – as well as trade fairs and travels abroad. The manufacturing itself is outsourced to China, but the plan is to bring at least some of it back to Europe. “The first Golla products were made by hand by as in the village of Kolla, where the name of the company comes from,” Kähkönen tells. “But once you start selling something in their millions, you’ve got to start looking elsewhere.” Golla has a subsidiary in China, a very international team of about a dozen people in its headquarters and one employee in Germany, one of the company’s main markets. The head count is set to grow soon, as future plans are big. “Consumer products are something people always need,” Kähkönen notes. “The world is a huge place to sell stuff, and with the right kind of branding it poses vast opportunities. Finland has definitely not reached its full potential, so there’s a lot of work to be done.” In spite, or because, of the whirlwhinds that have dictated Golla’s direction, Kähkönen doesn’t regret a day of entrepreneurship. When he founded the company with his brother in 1995, he was a lawyer with zero experience in design. “No previous knowledge was in the way,” he says and grins. “I always had a gift for visual things and an urge to try my own wings, and it definitely was the right choice.” All Golla designs are born here in Espoo, but they draw inspiration from whatever the designers see wherever they are in the world."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-first-superhero-movie-takes-on-the-world/,Finland’s first superhero movie takes on the world,"Seemingly insurmountable odds were overcome in order to bring this teenage dream to the big screen in spectacular fashion. Sitting in a downtown Helsinki restaurant, film director   sighs and reflects on the excesses of the past three years. In between travelling countless times Down Under to visit his girlfriend, Australian actress  , Haaja has completed his first full length movie – a stressful slog that resulted in him losing 20 kilograms. “If you want fast, easy weight loss, it only costs 1.3 million euros,” he says with a weary chuckle. “You will lose some hair at the same time, too.” Along with acquiring a smaller wardrobe, the end result of his journey is  , Finland’s first superhero movie. Lensed in seven cities and towns around the country, the film tugs at the dark seams that line the Finnish character to tell its pioneering tale. “Rendel is a husband and a dad, a very normal Finnish guy,” Haaja explains. “Then something happens and the only thing that’s left is revenge. He is so blinded by it, he doesn’t know what’s right or wrong anymore.” So, is it safe to say that he is a little more agitated than your regular, everyday superhero? “He’s kind of a Batman, Punisher sort of guy,” Haaja confirms. “If those two could make a baby…” Hollywood has been quick to cotton on to Haaja’s potential. Earlier this year the director signed with US-based Zero Gravity Management, which looks after a stable of stars including Elisabeth Röhm, Kevin Costner, Maggie Grace and Kellan Lutz. The blood, sweat and tears poured into  ’s production actually represent the second act of its story. The film’s origins can be traced back some 17 years ago, when Haaja was a student. Digging deep into his imagination, the teenager began to sketch the outline of a character. “I wanted to be a comic book artist,” he recalls. “But then I went to arts school and forgot the whole thing. I became a graphic designer and didn’t draw for many years.” A decade-and-a-half of a marketing career later and Haaja began to suffer from cluster headaches, a debilitating state of affairs that wreaked havoc on his wellbeing. Mercifully, his condition eventually stabilised and with newfound clarity he sought a fresh focus. “Once I felt like I had my life back, I thought about what I wanted to do with myself,” he states. “I realised I wanted to do a superhero film. It was then that I remembered I had my Rendel drawings in the garage.” Fuelled by a few fingers of whiskey, a whimsical Haaja posted the sketches on Facebook and promptly went to sleep. He awoke the following morning to an unexpected response. “Soon we had 20 000 followers on Facebook,” he recalls. “The newspapers here then reported that Finland was going to make its first full length superhero movie. But I had only wanted to do a short film…” The budding filmmaker’s response set the wheels in motion for the gruelling next stage of his life: “I decided, well, let’s do a feature then.” Although he had experience working on commercials and music videos with his day job, Haaja had actually never been on the set of a feature film. “How hard could it be?” he wondered to himself. “I had a vision, but no knowledge or experience,” he reflects. “I was pursuing my dream and didn’t have time to stop and think. The only thing that saved me was that I had no idea what I was doing.” Fortunately, he was taken under the wing of production company  , who were intrigued by his idea when they met at Cannes 2015. Funded by over 400 companies, the 1.3 million-euro budget was gathered from sponsors and gifts, along with product placement. Starting again from scratch, the script was rewritten in four days. The studio promptly gave Haaja the green light and soon cameras were rolling with an international cast. Finally, he was on his way to realising his dream – something easier said than done. “We filmed for 14 weeks, 20 hours a day with a low budget and big challenges; we didn’t sleep or eat,” Haaja recounts. “Luckily, I realised early on that I need to surround myself with people who are more capable than me. The experienced crew helped me a lot, as they had so many ideas. Without them it would have been a disaster.” Limited funds meant that the filmmakers had to find innovative ways to stretch every euro. Together, they were able to employ various cinematic tricks that boosted the look of the final product, without compromising the storytelling. Also lending its support was the local indie scene, with fellow filmmakers such as  ’s  on hand to share their insight with the upstart. Fast-forward to September 2017 and   is about to be released in Finland. Reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. “ Things are looking promising abroad too. The film screened at the Berlin Fantasy Fest, and Haaja hints that it has been sold to a number of international markets. And so, being as it is a superhero film, it seems there is only one thing left to add to the tale: merchandise. “When it comes to the superhero genre, the fans are very active and dynamic,” Haaja says. “They need that stuff.” Thus, Rendel’s mug is now emblazoned across action figures, torches, mice, powerbanks, tractors,   – and even condoms. “The fans want to buy everything you have,” Haaja states. “When we finished filming, I got an email from Texas. Someone wanted to buy my script with my notes on it for 5 000 US dollars.” Haaja lets out another of his frequent laughs. The one thing that has been a constant during these past three years has been his good humour, in the midst of a moviemaking crash course filled with more twists and turns than a typical feature length film. Now, with much resting on the success of   Haaja is still wearing a smile. “If everything goes well, it’s a really nice   story. If not, it’s a huge failure; a sad story. Someone can then go and make the film about that.”"

Finland may have the most metal bands per capital in the world, but this far from the end of the musical output of this northern land. The tech-minded spirit residing here means that many fresh sounds are being made and shared with the global audience in fresh ways. Let’s press play then. Before hitting the stage and belting out a four-count, there are a number of boxes that need to be checked. First up: how to find band members and music teachers? This matchmaking tool touts itself as a ‘LinkedIn for musicians’, bringing together the main players of your local music scene. “We welcome all musicians to our platform and don’t discriminate between genres or skill levels,” the company’s    . “We want people to start to play an instrument, or go and jam with somebody.” Having a band is one thing, but with no extra coin at hand to master your tracks, how can you possibly hope to prick up ears? Fear not, this crew can polish your tunes to distribution-worthy standards for only a fraction of the cost of traditional mastering services. “Mastering tools can be laborious to learn,” CEO and co-founder  . “We wanted to solve the problem on behalf of the masses we care about, which is amateur musicians.” Booking an artist to perform at an event may sound like a straightforward task, but the reality can dance to a very different tune indeed. This startup brings ease and efficiency to buying and selling live gigs via its one-stop shop, and  . “We have built process management tools for the sellers of live gigs and a marketplace for the buyers, where they can easily find and book interesting artists,”  , company founder and former event organiser,  . “[…] We hope to act as a bridge to international live music sales in future.” China currently has 530 million music streamers, with digital sales increasing by 70 per cent in 2015. So, keen to crack the mainland market with your musical output? This Finnish distribution service is on hand, quickly building a bridge between Asia and the Western countries with its global approach. “We have an international team, with many native language speakers,” CEO    . “That’s the reason why we have quickly acquired our clients from so many different countries.” Mobile gamers have been turning down the volume of their game play soundtracks for some time, preferring instead to tap their toes to their favourite tunes whilst flicking their thumbs. Zemeho’s music streaming plug-in service Valinta helps facilitate their aural environment of choice. Users simply click on the embedded V icon whilst playing and swiftly choose from a range of genre specific playlists. “This is just the beginning; our future is also in normal apps too,” company CEO  . “We are in talks with major sports and social media apps to provide the plug-in service.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/transport-of-natural-gas-is-green-for-lngtainer/,Transport of natural gas is green for LNGTainer,"This Finnish container technology takes natural gas transportation into a new phase with cost and energy efficiency.  knows a few things about maritime cargo. He has sailed the world’s seas since he was 16, worked on 100 000-tonne oil tankers, been a maritime safety inspector and run his own ship-management company. Over the years, the energy-inefficiency of oil and then liquefied natural gas (LNG) transports increasingly bothered him. “For example, asphalt is carried in 200 degrees and the space between the cargo tank and the outer shelf gets as hot as a Finnish sauna,” explains Sommardal. “I started to think something needs to be done to stop all this energy from being wasted. My idea was that if the insulation was inside, not outside the tank, these heat bridges could be removed.” Sommardal followed through by founding   in 2011, but it has taken a further six years to make his dream a reality. The result is a patented LNG Container, which houses the insulation layer inside the container’s pressure tank and is combined with a second light, flexible internal tank. The company says this makes it 30 per cent lighter, adds 15 per cent more capacity and uses less energy than traditional containers. It also brought longevity with the containers capable of storing gas for up to 60 days and removing the need for specialised trucks, terminals and storage facilities so LNG can be transported more easily to remote areas. Sommardal isn’t a man who gives up easily. He first started testing his internal insulation idea on asphalt tanks in 2009. Tom Sommardal “I lived in Katajanokka, in Helsinki, and boiled asphalt in my backyard. People were asking why it always smelled like asphalt in Katajanokka,” Sommardal laughingly recalls. “But these tests were successful and the insulation worked extremely well.” There was interest to use the innovation to transport heavy fuel oils, but Finnish shipping companies were already preparing their move from fuel oil to LNG ahead of the EU’s low sulphur directive. While heavy fuel oil needs to be kept at 60 to 120 degrees, LNG is transported in -164 degrees. Hence Sommardal had to make sure his insulation also worked in extreme subzero temperatures. That took six years, and another two years were added as Sommardal navigated LGNTainer through the required hoops for approval of its new container. It was a journey which would’ve defeated many entrepreneurs, but Sommardal was relentless. “When I start something, I know I can make it work. Natural gas reduces CO₂ emission by circa 25 per cent and that is the most important reason why I do this, to enable more people to use gas. It has taken a lot of patience and money, but we know we have done everything right and gone through the right channels.“ Sommardal is not the only one with confidence in his discovery. LNGTainer is now backed by three million euros from private investors and the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation  . LNGTainer finally launched the LNG Container in September and is working on its first orders. The company’s focus is now on sales and optimising its container production process, which it outsources to partners in Finland and abroad. The core innovation in Sommardal’s LNG container is moving its insulation from the outside to the inside of the pressure tank, which improves its energy-efficiency and storing capabilities. “We can use manufacturing partners, because with our technology ordinary pressure tanks can be transformed into LNG tanks. This means we can grow faster than our competitors,” Sommardal enthuses. “There are maybe 5 to 10 LNG tank container manufacturers globally, but thousands of pressure tank manufacturers.” LNGTainer plans to deliver its first containers to customers early next year. Sommardal knows disrupting an established market isn’t easy but believes the growing demand for cost efficient and sustainable LNG transportation around the world places the company in a strong position. “Our goal is that every company which requires LNG containers uses us. We want to have a large piece of this rapidly growing market.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cake-eat-food-home/,Have your cake and eat it with Food to Home,"Food ordering apps combine speed and convenience to fill an increasing number of stomachs worldwide. Now they can also earn users money at the same time. The current buzz surrounding food ordering apps is reflected in the number of delivery bicycles that can be seen weaving their way through city streets. Yet for all the thumb-flicking convenience of summoning your meal in a colour-coded bulky backpack, there are numerous potholes in the industry’s path which are slowing its momentum. Perhaps the biggest of all is the process of scaling up and increasing the number of restaurants and users on board. A couple of years ago,   COO   came up with a viable solution to this problem: motivate users to actively seek potential restaurants themselves. Once enterprises sign up, the person who convinced them to do so could receive a percentage cut of each transaction in future. “The basic idea is we have created a food ordering app,” Hippeläinen explains. “But, we want to give added value to the user by providing the possibility for them to start earning money by activating restaurants. In a sense we are outsourcing, crowdsourcing our sales force.” The first port of call for Hippeläinen and his soon-to-be co-founders was getting industry feedback on the idea. Their three-pronged approach was enthusiastically received. Alongside developing an ‘activator app’ for users, they would also create a separate one for establishments to manage their orders – not forgetting, of course, a food ordering app itself. “The idea came from the necessity that we needed to scale,” Hippeläinen says. “Getting the restaurants involved is the most difficult part of the process.” Brimming with enthusiasm, they took a deep breath and – kept their mouths firmly shut. “We actually haven’t made too much noise about it; we didn’t release our business model until we had the activator app ready,” Hippeläinen declares. “We cannot copyright the idea, or protect it. If we announced this two years ago anyone could have copied it.” Although the public has been kept in the dark, investors are certainly aware: to the tune of 1.5 million euros of funding already injected into the company. “We haven’t been able to advertise our funding rounds, so we kept it under the radar,” Hippeläinen says, with the smile of someone who has been sitting on some huge news for a considerable while. “Investors loved the idea that users can benefit, as it can have a similar effect as   did. People can say, ‘Oh, there are a couple of restaurants nearby I can activate.’” Alongside solving the problem of developing its user base, the company also seeks to overcome several other challenges currently confronting food ordering app growth. Firstly, Food to Home takes less commission than its competitors, and has significantly reduced the time it takes for restaurants to receive the money for each transaction. “With many services, if someone orders today, currently it might take a few weeks before restaurants get the money,” Hippeläinen says. “This might lead to a big problem whether they can actually buy ingredients for tomorrow or not. We have got it down to two–three days depending on the time of order.” Furthermore, the app works as a marketing platform for restaurants as well. “For example, a restaurant would be able to sell some burgers for the next two hours at a 50 per cent discount,” Hippeläinen says. “They would use the app to input this, then all users with the ordering app, say in a five-kilometre radius, receive a notification.” Rather than commission swarms of bike couriers to ferry meals to hungry users, at this stage Food to Home remains strictly a food ordering app. Given its global ambitions, this is in keeping with the needs of users. “Each market is different,” Hippeläinen says. “In Spain, the trend is that people prefer to go to restaurant and personally take away their meals. Currently, we don’t provide delivery ourselves. We do have something on the road map, but can’t say anything right now.” In order to communicate with users, the company is rolling out in all EU languages, and also Chinese. A recent visit to Hong Kong to meet with potential collaborators indicates that the idea will soon travel to many countries in Asia as well. “We don’t want to stop there,” Hippeläinen says. “We also don’t want to restrict methods of payment. In the future, Chinese users can use Alipay and WeChat Pay and other established methods. We are working with the same company that Uber, Spotify and Netflix are using to manage payments. Through that we can expand to 250 payment methods.” As Hippeläinen talks, one gets the impression that the business plan is unfolding like clockwork. This is merely the beginning for Food to Home. “We have some pretty interesting stuff ahead for next 12 months. We’ll add new features that none of our competitors have.” By using the activator app, anyone can register and find green bubbles on the map and discuss with restaurants if they want to be part of our service."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/emergence-winning-position/,Emergence is in a winning position,"Finnish location-tracking service Emergence has developed a maintenance-free IoT solution for asset management – powered solely by solar energy. Have you ever dreamt of a multitalent, jack-of-all-trades service that gets the most out of one’s physical assets in a user-friendly and ecological way? In the place of pipe dreams is  ’s Taival, which is an energy self-sufficient – and thus cost-efficient – IoT solution that improves asset management and the efficiency of logistics. In the present world, where the vast majority of goods are transported via seaborne trade, Taival emerges as a vital service for all types of cargo and for the safety of sea traffic. Taival is a maintenance-free energy self-sufficient tracking solution that is powered solely by the Sun. “Our service does not require hardware investments from customers,” says managing director  . “With a monthly fee, customers can utilise the whole package. It includes the usage of the device, access to our cloud services, mobile data connectivity and connections to services like SAP if required.” Emergence is much more than just a tracking device provider and positioning system, since Taival works as a hub for sensors and provides connectivity to the cloud. “We are constantly developing our service’s sensory capabilities,” Aaltonen explains. “For instance, Taival delivers information regarding temperature and humidity, but it may as well calculate the operating hours and the distance heavy machines have been running in order to estimate the need for maintenance.” When compared to other devices on the market, Taival reigns superior due to its non-existent maintenance costs. “Usually devices need repairs from time to time or their batteries must be replaced after some years or even months, but we have resolved this issue,” says Aaltonen. “Our solution goes along with the install-and-forget principle. It is guaranteed to be running for 10 years all alone.” Emergence’s device utilises various Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, and provides global positioning coverage. “We have a self-learning system in our hands that is brimming with intelligence,” tells Aaltonen. “Our competitors have passive devices that send data updates only on a daily basis, whereas Taival can update the data to our cloud as needed here, there and everywhere, even every five minutes.” Currently, Emergence is the only company in the world that is able to supply a maintenance-free solution for unpowered buoys regardless of harsh conditions. “The feedback has been encouraging,” Aaltonen adds. “We are running a pilot project together with the  , and our solution has worked miracles in improving sea safety. Positioning accuracy has been better than expected, and as a whole the device has received a warm welcome.” The Finnish Transport Agency is using Taival to follow the movements of buoys to ensure sea safety. Founded in 2008, initially the company focused on traditional monitoring service business. The idea of the new Emergence arose a couple of years ago and materialised during research cooperation with  . This was followed by further product development and piloting, and last year Emergence won the Elisa IoT Innovation Challenge at the tech startup event  . The company is looking to launch internationally later this year, with a focus on the UK, Germany and Spain. “Our clientele will mostly be mobile industrial assets,” tells Aaltonen. “Our solution is a perfect fit for regularly and irregularly moving, not so nickel-and-dime parts of the infrastructure and logistics chains, such as interchangeable and intermodal freight containers.” The company has raised half a million euros in their previous funding round. Currently, Emergence  . “We are eager to expand and grow fast,” Aaltonen reveals. “We are aiming to be a major player in the worldwide business of wireless positioning services.” Given that people, goods and chattels are more mobile than ever these days, Taival couldn’t be better positioned for future success."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nikari-shapes-finnish-wood-design-five-decades/,Nikari shapes Finnish wood design for five decades,"Fuelled by collaborations with Finnish design maestros, Nikari is celebrating its 50th year of creating premium, sustainable solid wood furniture. Under new ownership since 2010, the company wants to honour its heritage while looking to expand its international horizons. Durability, functionality and serenity. These three words summarise the design philosophy of Finnish wood furniture manufacturer  . The company’s understanding of wood as a raw material has seen it grow from a one-man workshop into an international business. “We value timeless design and combine proven, traditional wooden joints with contemporary forms,” says company CEO  . “Sustainability is very important to us. We mostly work with public premises, but our furniture is increasingly bought for private homes around the world.” Whether in a home or an office, these products are made to last for generations. Nikari’s furniture is manufactured at its own studio-workshop in Fiskars, Southwest Finland, and at selected collaborator workshops around the country. The village is known as a centre for arts, crafts and design, but it is also home to some of Finland’s most biodiverse forests. Nikari works closely with local suppliers to select the right timber for each of its products and favours wood from certified forests. In the hands of its cabinet makers (and with some help from new technology) the timber is then transformed into design furniture and furnishings. The finishing touch is treatment with natural oils and waxes to ensure the products age with grace. Nikari uses wood from certified forests, runs its workshop with local hydro power and plans its transport routes based on the most efficient use of cargo space and transport miles. Nikari’s passionate approach to wood materials comes from its founder  . Today Virtanen is an award-winning master cabinet maker, but in 1967 he had just started his own workshop, nicknamed ‘Nikari’. This craftsmanship was recognised by renowned Finnish architect  ’s office and the young talent was hired to work on a church project. It was a defining moment for Virtanen. “The master architect shared his thoughts on architecture and design with the young cabinet maker, and he wanted to continue on the same modern design path,” Vuorio says. “Their collaboration continued for years.” Some 50 years later the story of Nikari reads like a ‘who’s who’ of Finnish design. In addition to Aalto, Virtanen has collaborated with many household designer names, including  ,   and  . Virtanen himself also boasts a design in the permanent collection of MoMA, New York’s prestigious Museum of Modern Art. This collaborative approach is now continued under Nikari’s new ownership. Vuorio was appointed the company’s CEO in 2009 and a year later became the majority share owner together with design director   All under the fatherly supervision of Virtanen. The generational change has marked a new phase of growth and internationalisation for Nikari. In 2010, the company began licensing the manufacturing of its products for domestic sales in Japan and two years later launched a major international collaboration with WWF Finland. “We celebrated the Helsinki World Design Capital year by launching new furniture every month,” Vuorio explains. “Each product in this ‘12 Designs for Nature’ series had a different designer. About half of them came from Finland and the rest from around the globe.” Today Nikari’s products are exported to 23 countries and new items are added regularly. The company employs a total of nine cabinet makers, who also participate in various furnishing projects and advise on product development and wood architecture projects, both in Finland and overseas. Throughout the expansion what remains is an appreciation for Nikari’s core values: high-quality craftsmanship, contemporary design and sustainability. “It has been so impressive to see how Nikari has maintained pride for craftsmanship and traditional woodworking skills for all these years,” Vuorio says. “We want to cherish these strong values and slowly grow into an ever more international design brand.” High-quality craftsmanship, contemporary design and sustainability come together with Nikari."

Thanks to Finnish innovation, 3D pieces and mini computers can now be your new accessories. Inspired by the fusion of quotidian utility with the elegance of jewellery, a sleep and activity tracking device can be worn as an elegant ring. Meanwhile, tech innovations have also been used to develop production, with the use of 3D printing adding a modern vibe. Elsewhere, maintaining a contemporary quality is about trusting expertise. See for yourself what Finnish bling is all about, in this quintet for the week’s end. Named after the Finnish national epic poem, Kalevala aims to draw inspiration from local cultural heritage and thus uses chiefly Finnish materials. As one of the largest jewellery manufacturers in Northern Europe, the company has utilised its large market share to advance Finnish culture abroad. Breaking with tradition, Kalevala has also sought to add a modern vibe to their jewellery using high technology, utilising tools such as 3D printing. “What is distinctive is the way we combine strong Finnish design heritage and modern jewellery design,” business development manager    .

Two Finnish entrepreneurs show how silicone can be used in a new way with the employment of new production techniques. Light and soft to the touch, silicone offers a plethora of opportunities for artistic expression. “The flat material is challenging, because you can’t make three-dimensional figures… but our designers have created incredibly beautiful shapes, from feathers to flowers,” described Coruu co-founder    . Six generations of Tillanders have run this jewellery company which specialises in bespoken jewellery, gold pieces and gemstones. The company prides itself on expertise with design experts, pearl experts, gemmology, master goldsmiths and goldsmiths. Jewellery design is often personalised to buyers, but inspiration is also drawn from each individual gem. “The world moves rapidly, and customers are always seeking something new,” CEO and designer Tina Tillander  . “I travel a lot in search of new gems and pearls, as the ideas always stem from materials.”"

This year’s   is being celebrated under the theme of “together”, with a broad range of events on offer where people can cut loose in a way that cheerfully challenges the notion of Finns being quiet and reserved. So, for this Friday, here are five unique annual happenings around Finland that are worth one’s while. This groovy gathering in the village of Sodankylä in Lapland has been acknowledged as one of the most trailblazing festivals in Europe. “Midnight Sun Film Festival boasts one of the most unusual atmospheres of any festival in the world: top directors, up-and-coming talent, an international audience and the common person on the street come together under the midnight sun,” the jury of Europe for Festivals, Festivals for Europe Awards  .

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/host-pet-gives-pet-owners-break/,Host My Pet gives pet owners a break,"Animals are lovely companions in everyday life, but jumping on a holiday plane with them isn’t necessarily a viable option. Host My Pet offers a helping hand to people and their best friends. Worrying is the last thing you want to do when you’re on vacation. However, leaving a furry friend behind can cause extra stress for holiday-goers: whom can I trust to look after my dearest? Ukranian   travels every now and then, but she’d never want to take her cat at a kennel. Once she had to cancel a trip to Italy because no friend or relative was available to look after her pet. Then Shevchenko spoke to her friend  , who’d just won the   hackathon with a business idea: an Airbnb for pets in the need of care and/or accommodation. She was shocked to find out Mutlu’s hackathon team wasn’t going to follow through with the idea. “I said I would volunteer to help him set up the company,” Shevchenko says. “I know it can be such a struggle for pet owners to find someone reliable to look after their pet, and I thought this would be a perfect solution.” Now, a little over two years later, both Shevchenko and Mutlu are co-founders of   and run the company from Ukraine and Turkey respectively. The third co-founder, Vietnamese  , joined the team at its very early steps. He lives and studies in Helsinki, which is both the birthplace and the base of Host My Pet. Host My Pet is a very international team. Co-founders are Daniel Ta (in the middle), Mert Kürşat Mutlu (second row left) and Julia Shevchenko (third row left). Initially, Host My Pet set out to alleviate the concern of travel-loving pet owners. The company’s platform introduces pet owners to pet sitters, whose reliability and experience have been confirmed by the Host My Pet team. Not just anyone can sign up as pet sitter: they need to apply, and all profiles on the platform are subject to approval. “We don’t want people who only do it for money,” Shevchenko explains. “We want pet sitters to genuinely love animals and have experience in looking after them.” Pet sitting is only the first step in the startup’s ambitious plans. At the moment, the platform includes dog walking, home visits and pet boarding, meaning that the pet sitter also accommodates the animal. In the future, the service will include house sitting, pet-friendly taxi companies, pet grooming services, contact details to nearby vet clinics and dog holiday options that let people send their dogs to have fun at a farm. Host My Pet takes a commission from the fees paid through the site. Later on, the company hopes to collaborate with other businesses such as vet clinics, grooming services and high-quality pet product manufacturers. It aims to provide a pet insurance that covers possible vet costs as well as around-the-clock customer service. There’s also a mobile app to help pet owners and pet sitters keep in touch on the go and send and receive photos of the pet. At the moment Host My Pet is only available in Finland, but eventually it wants to enter all European countries. Europe in general seems like a fruitful market for the service, considering the number of households with pets as well as Europeans’ fondness for travel. If everything goes to plan, Host My Pet will launch its service either in Sweden or Turkey later this year or early next. The expansion is planned to happen country by country. “We need to make sure we comply with local legal regulations and have the right contacts,” Shevchenko notes. Another goal is to be able to provide a caretaker for pets of any level of fluff: not only cats and dogs, but also fish and snakes might be in the need of help too. With no extra funding in hand, Host My Petters have been running the company alongside with their studies and other projects. The three founders are supported by a team consisting of friends and trainees who want to gain experience and learn more about setting up a company in general. Host My Pet is also searching for friendly ambassadors from its target market: pets themselves. “These days people have Instagram accounts and blogs for their pets,” Shevchenko points out. “We’ll be having some very cute ambassadors for Host My Pet soon!” Host My Pet can also be used for regular dog walking, for example during the owner’s long working days or illnesses."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/get-on-board-with-world-of-insights/,Get on board with World of Insights,"These game-based solutions set out to make analogue the new digital, by providing a fresh approach to acquiring knowledge. The sauna. Every Finn’s favourite room in the house – or by the lakeshore, for that matter. Yet, for all of the deep cleansing that goes on in this small, sweaty space, it also provides the perfect platform for personal expression. There is something powerful and inclusive about huddling around a hot stove, akin to telling stories around a campfire. This is the core idea behind  , a selection of board games and tools that seek to accelerate innovation at work – with decidedly more clothes on, of course. “The purpose is to create a shared space,” explains company CEO and co-founder  . “You are in a different frame of mind. The focus is on each other and there is no digital screen between people. After taking the game out, people just relax.” Thus, the familiar and social experience of deceptively simple card and board games invites a fresh approach to learning, spurred by elements of luck. “Our core value is to move away from lectures; from one person having the knowledge delivering to an audience that doesn’t,” Hochman says. “We wanted to create an experience through which people can be engaged and acquire the information that they need.” Alongside its analogue offering, the company is also developing digital and hybrid products, where cards and other game elements can interact with touch screens. The games cover various aspects of business, ranging from innovation and personal development to leadership, and are directed towards business schools and consultants, managers and leaders. “We work with a lot of professors,” Hochman says. “It could also be a CEO trying to communicate strategy or HR trying to inform values. Basically, any time you want to create knowledge without telling people directly.” This innovative business idea has solid foundations. During their 17 years in the field of education and learning design, Hochman and her co-founder   have collaborated with staff from some of the world’s top business schools, including Yale, the London School of Economics and Vlerick Business School in Belgium. “We wanted to provide a very simple solution with a lot of complex ideas behind it,” Hochman says. “You don’t need to be a skilled facilitator, or learn new skills. You can just set up and basically the game plays itself.” This ease of play taps into various parts of the brain and ways of answering, providing fertile ground indeed for informal learning. “One example is that you have to draw the answer,” Hochman explains. “That uses a completely different way of thinking than talking. It mobilises different capacities within yourself.”  “The games are a way of opening possibilities,” says CEO Eliza Hochman. “Our passion is around learning, and gaming is a part of that.” After bootstrapping its way through early stages of development, World of Insights received a funding boost from   to help build momentum. On its way towards a promising future, the company is continuing to raise further funds building on top of a growing income stream. “People in the field who have played a simulation or a serious game, are very, very interested in what we are doing,” Hochman states. “Often when we show the game or talk about it, people make the connection to their own content and straight away can see how it would be useful.” Nonetheless, amidst all this information exchange, this is still a game and there must be winners and losers, right? Hochman smiles and gently appeases those with a competitive streak. “Very often in the beginning we have this question, but never at the end,” she says. “Once they have played they see it is not the most critical element. The game is a collaborative process that helps people reach their insights.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arcteq-powers-electricity-networks/,Arcteq powers up electricity networks,"Smart grids are facing considerable change worldwide. Finnish protection relay and smart grid expert Arcteq has what it takes to benefit from the transformation. Simply put: the current age of technology innovation is often mind-boggling. Yet we still live in a world where many crucial functions of developing countries are subject to frustrating power failures. Nevertheless, transition for good is an inevitable phenomenon, and Finland is at the forefront with its  . “Over 90 per cent of our production is exported to countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brazil and South Africa,” says   managing director  , pointing out that more established markets such as the US are also on the company’s radar. Smart grids are tipped to bring major changes to people’s lives. Governmental control of electricity grids is being reduced, while grids are being more decentralised and meticulous, yet  . Ultimately, this guarantees increased energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy resources into the system. “Our products cut off electricity selectively in order to ensure the best efficiency, while creating better safety for people and devices,” Arvola explains. The company’s business idea consists of complete solutions for transmission, sub-transmission and distribution power protection needs. It is renowned for its truly intelligent devices and markets itself as the provider of the most accurate relays in the world,  . “The feedback we’ve received praises our modern perspective and eye-opening technology when it comes to the new generation of grids and relays,” says Arvola. Arcteq has revolutionised the industry’s measurement technology and is able to provide more accurate information about the state of a network than anyone previously. Its success is based on experienced personnel with exemplary expertise. While the company’s major competitors are huge multinational, multi-function companies, specialising only in protection relays and smart grid has given it a considerable advantage. “Our customers appreciate our independence,” Arvola tells. “Our comprehensive offering, know-how and agility serves to help our customers to add value. Our typical customers are different electricity companies and transmission system operators, but on the other hand heavy industry as well.” Arcteq was found in 2010 as a spin-off from Vamp, after it was acquired by French company Schneider. The founders, who already had a strong background in international sales, saw it clear to go immediately abroad. “We are proud to continue building on the long tradition of Finnish protection relay design,” Arvola remarks. The company is headquartered in Vaasa, Finland, with a research and development centre also in Poland. All Arcteq products are designed and manufactured in Finland using the latest technologies. “During the first three years we focused on research and development, and now it has continued with commercial activities,” Arvola explains. “Close collaboration with local universities and laboratories at   forms an integral part of our success.” All Arcteq products are designed and manufactured in Finland. During the past seven years of its existence, the company has been growing steadily. Today, Arcteq employs 20 people in Finland and 15 abroad, whereas the turnover has been increasing annually around 30 per cent. It is expected to reach five million euros in 2017. “We have been growing pretty well corresponding to our business plan,” Arvola explains. “Our aim is to increase the growth in the upcoming years, but do it controllably.” Currently, Arcteq has established a worldwide network through local offices and partners. It is doing business on all continents in over 40 countries. “Usually companies have a product first and then start to build the network,” Arvola laughs. “We started to proceed contrariwise and we are doing just fine.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/appchieve-didn-t-happen/,Appchieve it or it didn’t happen,"The new Finnish app for sharing experiences started as the idea of a bored young man who decided to create his own bucket list. Then he thought, “Why not make this a game?”  Appchieve co-founder   knows that the phrase might sound a little dramatic for some, but that’s what the company is aiming for. Jan-Mikael Nokelainen “We acknowledge that the idea might make some uncomfortable,” he points out. “But that’s our underlining message: Appchieve is The Place where you can prove and share your achievements.” Appchieve is, like it says on the tin, an app which enables people to collect points and rewards for their life events. Each achievement needs to be validated: for example, if you say you’ve been to the Niagara Falls, your GPS needs to verify your location, or if you’ve given birth to a child, your friends and family should confirm it really happened. The bigger the achievement, the more evidence is required. The history of Appchieve began when CEO   found himself a little bored on a regular afternoon two years ago. He started wondering what kinds of things he’d want to be reminiscing about in a rocking chair when he’s old, and wrote his personal bucket list. “Joonas has played a lot of games in his life, and he wondered why there wasn’t a way to bring elements of gaming to everyday life,” Nokelainen explains. “That way you could play the biggest game of all: life itself.” Griesinger introduced the thought to Nokelainen and  . Soon, the guys formed the founding trio of the startup. Appchieve isn’t about bragging what you’ve done and where you’ve been – at least exclusively. It also wants to help people find new things to do and try. For example, in Helsinki the range of challenges includes island hopping and a statue hunt around town, as well as visiting every single district in the capital. Hence, it’s not only for tourists but locals looking for activities, too. “Challenges vary from very small ones, like visiting an attraction or things you can do at home, to climbing Mount Everest and getting married,” Nokelainen explains. As the app is free of charge for consumers, the revenue is collected from companies that want to grab the public’s attention. Companies can encourage consumers to try their services by advertising them on Appchieve or offering discounts or other benefits to users, similarly to Foursquare. Municipalities and city councils can utilise the platform as well. On top of being a marketing and social media platform, Appchieve is about creating communities. Companies may use the app to track the performance and award the success of their employees, and so can teachers with their students. “Appchieve can be used in education and learning as well, and those collecting enough achievements can rise to mentors.” Also, after gathering a certain number of points, people can start creating their own challenges and share them with others. This enables crowdsourcing information about local sights and activities. There are some social media users who’ve found themselves overwhelmed with sharing their lives online, and hence choose to keep personal things away from social media. Facebook   about this, too. The app enables people to collect points and rewards for their life events. This doesn’t worry Nokelainen. He points out that the huge popularity of   shows how gamification can make people move. “The elements of gaming appeal to young people, and we’ll be adding more and more of them as we proceed. In the long run, we’re looking into the possibilities brought about by augmented and virtual reality.” Those who don’t wish to share their personal achievement with others can do so by setting their accounts to private mode or decide whom they allow onto their list of followers. “There are people who want to shine a light on what they’ve done and share it with as many as possible, and there are others who aren’t competitive at all and want to keep their personal lives to themselves. Appchieve caters for both.” At the moment, the app can be downloaded in Europe. Nokelainen believes the market potential to be huge, especially in the US and Asia, but the waters are being tested nearer to home first. He mentions that the Asian market can’t be conquered without help from locals. “Appchieve isn’t location-specific,” he says. “For us, communities, hobbies and groups of friends are what it all boils down to.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jalofoods-serves-tradition-today-s-tables/,Jalofoods serves tradition on today’s tables,"Finnish Jalofoods wants to bring traditionally made plant-based food prepared in ethical and eco-friendly ways to all plates and dinner tables – not just those of vegetarians. “But where do you get your protein?” The question arguably every single vegetarian and vegan has to answer regularly is just as annoying every time. How do cows and horses grow muscles when all they eat is their greens? Previously known as Soya,  has been producing an answer to this reoccurring query for almost three decades: low-carb, high-protein tofu. Tofu itself is much, much older than the Jalofoods factory in Tammisaari, but when it comes to its presence in Finland, the company can be called a forerunner. It’s only in the past few years that the selection of plant-based options in restaurants and supermarkets has grown more and more abundant, so Jalofoods has taken a head start. “When   founded the company in 1989, not a lot of people were talking about the rise of plant-based protein,” says  , commercial director at Jalofoods. “The core of his idea was to produce genuinely tasty food with actual nutritional value, respecting old Japanese recipes and traditions.” The ownership has since changed and the list of ingredients expanded. Last year, Jalofoods acquired Finnish  , a company producing tempeh from soya, lupine and fava beans, so Jalotofu will be joined by Jalotempe later this year. The range of tofu flavours has also grown, most recently with chilli and beetroot. Despite the obvious vegetarian and vegan trend, globally meat consumption is still on the rise. Riihimäki doesn’t see Jalofoods working towards replacing or eradicating meat; rather, the aim is add to the alternatives that enable people to make their diets healthier and more sustainable, without forgetting animal welfare issues. Jouko Riihimäki “People are increasingly aware of the effects of food production on both their health and the environment,” he notes. “The fact is that the biggest increase in sales doesn’t come from full-on vegans and vegetarians as such, but from people who choose to reduce their meat consumption and opt for plant-based alternatives more often than they used to.” This makes tempeh particularly interesting for a company like Jalofoods. Riihimäki explains that as tempeh has ‘more bite’ to it than tofu due its firmer structure, many omnivores find it easier to adjust to. Other plant-based protein options might be included on the Jalofood menu later. “Similarly to when an oil company becomes an energy company, we used to be known for soya, but now we’re about a lot more than just one plant – as important as it continues to be.” Sustainability runs through the whole company. Riihimäki says that Jalofoods is constantly striving to find ways to make its processes more and more eco-friendly. “We’ve got our own solar panels and use eco-certified energy, and we minimise waste by utilising byproducts. Being value-led and investing in sustainable solutions doesn’t need to be economically ineffective; rather, they are mutually supportive.” Jalofoods is the biggest tofu producer in the Nordic countries. Almost all Jalotofu products are certified organic and Fair Trade, and the soya beans grown at a partner farm run by families in Capanema, Brazil. “Cleanliness, naturalness and fairness can’t be compromised,” Riihimäki says. “Although tofu is, by definition, processed, our goal is to process it as carefully and naturally as possible, following organic principles and only using the best ingredients.” The selection of Jalotofu is a common sight in Finnish supermarkets, and it’s also used by ready-made food producers and restaurants, such as restaurant  ’s vegan omelettes. Riihimäki points out that for a small company, growing together with partners that share similar values is a way forward. “We don’t want to jump on the wagon with just anyone; it’s really important that our strategies and principles are similar.” Jalofoods has established sales in Sweden and Estonia. Soon, the company is set out to hop on shop shelves in Norway and Denmark, later Germany and Baltics. Entering markets isn’t the biggest challenge; what needs to be worked on is making more people find plant-based proteins a credible alternative to what their plates are filled with now. With the help of partners, Jalofoods caters for both people cooking from scratch and those looking for the easiest and quickest option. “There are fans of slow food, but the world is moving toward a more and more hectic direction,” Riihimäki points out. “Not everyone is  ; we want to offer sustainable vegetarian food that suits all lifestyles.” Jalofoods newbie Vegeström is beetroot-flavoured tofu."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jakamo-s-social-network-business/,Jakamo’s social network is all business,"Manufacturing companies may not want to share their holiday pictures, but they do need to exchange information with others in their supply chain. A social network designed for this exact purpose has attracted customers from all over the world. When   and  were working as supply chain consultants eight years ago they repeatedly ran into the same question: how can a manufacturing company easily share information and collaborate with its suppliers, customers and other partners? As anyone who regularly tackles a full inbox is fully aware of, email is not the answer. “Everybody knows the problems with email: Was someone cc’d in? What if they are on holiday? When was a certain message sent?” outlines Anttila, co-founder and CMO of  . “We couldn’t find a single service to solve these problems, so we started to build one ourselves.” The result was a cloud-based collaboration platform called Jakamo (‘a place or machine for sharing’ in Finnish). Launched in 2012, the platform acts as a social network for the manufacturing industry where companies can connect with their existing partners, find new ones and invite others to join the ecosystem. Jakamo offers tools for sharing files, commenting, chatting and posting updates along the supply chain. “Previously, [supply chain] information has been scattered around several tools, but with Jakamo a company can do it all in one place,” Anttila says. Five years later the platform has over 1 500 users, ranging from small workshops to big corporations spread across 44 countries. Collaboration software is a highly competitive market, but Jakamo has found its niche by targeting the manufacturing industry. For Uitto, co-founder and CEO, another crucial element is its focus on cross-company collaboration. The name Jakamo is designed to be easy to pronounce, but also to reflect the company. In Finnish, it means ‘a place or machine for sharing’ “Most other collaboration platforms are meant for internal team work,” he explains. “You might be able to invite external members to join in, but they are invited as individuals and nothing is shared between companies.” Jakamo wants to ensure the information stays within a company, even when somebody changes jobs. The platform includes 13 applications targeted at different stages of the supply chain, such as order management, engineering changes and reclamations. Jakamo also works closely with other IT firms, notably Microsoft, to integrate its platform with their software. In May, it was invited to join the tech giant’s booth at The Next Web startup conference in Amsterdam and a few months later selected into Microsoft’s new market entry programme, Turbopump. For a 10-person startup from Seinäjoki, Finland, association with big brands is an important door opener, particularly among corporate customers. With its speedy internationalisation Jakamo has taken a page from Facebook’s playbook. Existing customers spread the message by inviting their partners to join the platform and fees only kick in if a company wants to upgrade to premium features. “Our invitation logic has seen us expand to so many countries,” Uitto says. “Furthermore, the service has been designed from the start to be globally scalable. You need to be able to use it anywhere in the world.” Currently, 70 per cent of Jakamo’s customers are in Finland. The next step for the startup is to complement its organic growth with a more concentrated international effort. Jakamo is planning to open its first European office at an undisclosed location in the autumn before gradually spreading out to other key markets. Jakamo’s road map also plans expansions to Asia and the US,  . These steps are needed if the startup is to reach its highest ambition: to become ‘the place to be’ for manufacturing companies. “Manufacturing is one of the most highly networked industries in the world,” Anttila says. “We want Jakamo to become the standard platform where companies must be present to efficiently collaborate with each other.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-wind-power/,Five for Friday: Wind power,"With every cloud comes a silver lining, and with every flurry of wind comes the possibility for harnessing a renewable energy source. From the midnight sun all the way to the frozen sea, Finland’s climate is a force to be reckoned with year-round. The extremity of the conditions here not only fuels Finnish  , it also provides ample opportunities for innovation. Thus, the same gust of wind that causes you to wrap your summer poncho a little tighter, also carries with it ample potential for sustainable energy solutions. Looking for a breath of fresh air in the sector? Here’s what’s happening in wind power up north. This energy company has a crowded CV, producing electricity as well as heating and cooling services produced chiefly from hydropower, nuclear power, combined heat and power, along with condensing power. Being open to the winds of change means that Fortum is also embracing renewable sources of energy in   and Norway. The company’s     that the purchase of three wind power projects in Norway is “completely in line with our strategy to expand in solar and wind power”. Having operations in over 30 countries in Europe, in 2015 this construction technology company exported its wind farm foundation technology outside of the EU for the first time, with the construction of a wind farm in Kenya.

Also breaking new ground, albeit with the world’s first floating offshore wind farm in Scotland, this specialist in offshore oriented engineering services  . “MacGregor was chosen for the task because of its long history of designing and delivering very reliable mooring solutions for offshore floating production units for the harsh conditions in the North Sea,” stated the company’s  . Designing wind turbines in Northern Europe is the bread and butter of this technical consulting service, as well as manufacturing and maintenance services. In early 2017, Wind Controller expanded its operations,  , which has a presence in a number of African countries as well as its homeland. Alongside all manner of exciting discoveries related to smart technologies, profitable solutions and innovation services, rest assured that this research centre is also putting the wind in the sails for renewables. Case in point:   that windfarms have on television broadcasting and mobile communication. “With our methods, it is possible to verify the impacts and investigate their actual causes, and thereby identify the source of problems and mitigate the impacts,” describes principal scientist ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nordic-conditions-drive-automated-vehicles-to-finnish-line/,Nordic conditions drive automated vehicles to the Finnish line,"Snow, ice and long winters are typically associated with Finland, and the country likes to play them to its advantage. Now they are being combined with 5G mobile technology to put autonomous vehicles to the test in Arctic conditions.   The Finnish city of Oulu, located only 230 kilometres from the Arctic Circle, boasts a long history of ICT innovation. Lately the city has made headlines for its   and a groundbreaking 5G test network,  . Now this next generation mobile technology is being harnessed to power a unique Arctic research and test centre for autonomous vehicles and machinery. “We are building a 5G-equipped test environment open to anyone working with autonomous vehicles,” explains  , CEO of  , the new test area. “We haven’t found anything similar globally.” The test area, expected to open in early 2018, is a joint effort between multiple partners including the University of Oulu, Oulu University of Applied Sciences and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. In addition to self-driving vehicles, the research will focus on autonomous working machinery, construction automation and robotics. This means visitors will need look out for bulldozers and heavy duty trucks cruising around without a driver. But the caution will be worth it as the tests will tackle some of the major challenges with autonomous vehicles both in private and industrial use, weather being the crucial one. “If the conditions are good and the weather nice, even with current technology a car can drive safely without a driver,” explains  , professor at the University of Oulu. “But when you add ice and snow storms, the road markings disappear and there is still a long way to go for safety in these conditions.” With over 160 days a year of guaranteed winter weather in Oulu, the researchers have found their ideal testing ground. Collaboration between many different organisations is a real strength in Finland. OuluZone was originally opened in 2010 as a motor sports and freetime activity centre. It already hosts tracks and technology for vehicle and tire testing, which will now be expanded for the automated trials and eventually equipped with a high-speed 5G network. The test area will be open to universities, research institutes and companies to use, both from Finland and abroad. The University of Oulu is already preparing its first research projects: “We are building a full road construction site which covers the whole site management process. We aren’t just testing individual working machines, but how different machines work together,” Heikkilä describes. “They will be constantly online with cloud services used to monitor and optimise their work on the fly.” In cooperation with Finnish Transport Safety Agency Trafi, the university is also developing a winter driving examination for self-driving cars. In such icy conditions, parallel parking could prove stressful even for computers. OuluZone is just one part Finland’s efforts to become a pioneering development environment for intelligent transport automation. The country already has some of the world’s most permissive legislation towards autonomous vehicles and several pilot projects are ongoing. One of the most significant ones is  , a test ecosystem of closed and open roads for automated driving located in Finnish Lapland and OuluZone is a partner. “Collaboration between many different organisations is a real strength in Finland,” says Heikkilä. Collaboration also plays a key role across Finnish infrastructure industry which, according to Heikkilä, has the most advanced open data sharing format in the world. All parties are required to produce data in the same format, but anyone can also use it to develop new applications. These innovations could soon be tested at OuluZone: “Ouluzone is a collaboration resource, which we can develop together to be a significant and renewed international asset. It will benefit everyone,” Heikkilä concludes. In addition to self-driving vehicles, the research will focus on autonomous working machinery, construction automation and robotics."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sleepless-baby-bear-awakens-global-interest/,Sleepless baby bear awakens global interest,"A Finnish children’s book about a little bear called Mur is charming both kids and grown-ups in an increasing number of countries. “ ” As bedtime approaches, parents of small children are likely to face occasional objections. Children, not bound by the adult constructs of clocks and alarms, might not feel tired at the same time every single day. What about baby bears? Are they always up for going to bed when the time for hibernation, or winter sleep, hits? Anne Vasko and Kaisa Happonen Baby bear   most definitely isn’t; the poor little one is always awake or asleep at the wrong time. There just isn’t much room for rebelling in the woods. “That’s just what bears do in this forest!” is the older bears’ response. Mur, quite obviously, isn’t an actual animal. The character is the creation of writer   and illustrator  , whose book   has been winning over hearts across the globe. So far, translation rights have been sold, sometimes even auctioned, for 10 languages, including French, German and Chinese. “People have told us that in Mur’s story, somehow the images and the story work exceptionally well together,” Happonen says. “The entity is deemed Arctic and fresh.” Mur was, in a way, born from a painting of a bear in tears on Vasko’s wall. When it caught Happonen’s attention, Vasko pointed out that the bear didn’t have a story yet. Happonen started to contemplate why the bear was crying. One day, it suddenly occurred to her: the poor little friend was forced to go to bed for the whole winter, despite not feeling like sleeping and instead, wanting to feel the snow and look at the sky. Vasko’s Mur doesn’t resemble the original painting. The duo developed a completely new world that exists around the bear. “In my writing in general, but especially in the case of Mur, I always focus strongly on the narrative,” Happonen explains. “Mur’s story feels like it all came from the same desk, that’s how inseparable the illustrations and the text are.” Translating Mur’s story into foreign languages brought about a challenge: The original Mur is genderless, as Finnish language uses the word   for both hes and shes. Without gender-specific pronouns, the author didn’t need to think of Mur as a boy or a girl. As translators wanted a solution, Happonen decided Mur is a she. “Especially in some cultures, it’s much less likely for girls to rebel against traditions and rules than it is for boys,” she explains. “I like the idea of her being a power animal for girls around the world.” This is what Mur has been to Happonen herself, too. She believes Mur’s example makes both children and adults reflect on who they really are. “Mur has taught me a lot about following my own instincts instead of others’ expectations. Often people just do things out of habit or custom, when listening to what you actually want can be a liberating experience.” Being a creature of the 2000s, Mur has its own app, too. Developed by Danish Step In Books, the award-winning tool only works together with the book, letting readers enter the forest and see it from Mur’s perspective. As the illustrator, Vasko was involved in the making of the app. “It was really interesting, as I’ve often wondered what it would feel like to walk into my own painting,” she notes. The app is like a digital path through a Finnish forest. As a child needs assistance using the app, the screen time is shared. Vasko points out that instead of everyone playing with their own devices, Mur helps the carer and the child spend quality time together. “It’s magical for both big and small people to see the illustrations come to life, like it’s a digital window to Finnish nature.” Vasko and Happonen are working on another Mur story together, and considering the predecessor’s growing success, the bear’s story might continue for more and more books. But what’s with telling a child not to go to bed when the time comes? Happonen admits laughingly that she is aware of what risky business it is to show small children an example of refusing bedtime orders. “Some reviewers have even said they shouldn’t give the book any stars because of the questionable message,” she says. However, Mur might also be of support for the sleepy struggles: “For example, my son’s favourite bit is where Mur is trying to fall asleep in different positions, so it’s become a bedtime play for him if he’s not feeling tired.”"

Ron de Jeremy was just another bar joke.   and   were in Amsterdam, relaxing with an afterwork pint, and they saw a poster for a  .   means ‘rum’ in Spanish, and   is arguably the most famous Ron in the world. That night, Laune drafted a label of the then imaginary bottle on a napkin. “We thought it was really funny – but at the time that’s all it was,” Hietalahti recalls. “But it kept on popping back to my thoughts every now and then.” Olli Hietalahti (left), actor Niklas Hogner and Jouko Laune Six years later, Laune created an actual layout of what the label could be and showed it to Hietalahti. He was sold. “We decided we needed to see if it could actually happen,” Hietalahti says. However, you can’t just splash someone’s name and face on a bottle and go sell it; they needed to get in touch with Jeremy himself. Fortunately, during a visit to Finland, the man himself had kindly provided a local lady (and an acquaintance of the men behind the idea) with his personal phone number. Nervously and with written notes to support his pitch, Hietalahti grabbed the phone and suggested a meeting. Jeremy agreed to give them 30 minutes of his time, and so Hietalahti and Laune flew over to Los Angeles. It was worth the extra miles: the man said yes. “He’s received all sorts of requests throughout his career, but this was something no one had ever proposed. He was keen to join along.” Flying almost across the whole planet sounds like a lot of effort when the answer could’ve been a downright ‘no’. Weren’t Hietalahti and Laune anxious? “We figured it’d at least be a nice holiday in LA, if nothing else!” With the newly-founded   and Ron Jeremy’s stamp of approval, the two advertising professionals with zero booze business experience found themselves formulating a drink to pair with its unique namesake. The work paid off, and now there are four award-winning varieties of Ron de Jeremy rum and The Hedgehog gin. After the success of Ron de Jeremy, the growing amount of   caught Hietalahti’s attention. The artist’s global appeal and commercial potential made it a suitable candidate for the men’s next endeavour. “There are so many positive values entwined in Tom of Finland that made it interesting: creativity, courage, liberty, equality, humanity,” Hietalahti lists. “These things resonate strongly both in and outside the target group, which for us is gay communities around the globe.” Tom of Finland Vodka is officially sold by  , which is a separate company from One Eyed Spirits. The people behind it are still Hietalahti and Laune. Tom of Finland is made in Finland from top to bottom. Whereas Ron de Jeremys are distilled in the Caribbean and bottled in the Netherlands, Tom of Finland Vodka deliberately tips its hat to  ’s birthplace. It’s made of organic Finnish wheat and rye by Finnish distillery  . “We were thinking about all kinds of options, but soon it occurred to us that you can’t sell Tom of Finland Vodka made anywhere else than in Finland.” Ron de Jeremy is now sold in around 30 countries around the globe from Kenya to Canada, and Tom of Finland Vodka is on bar and shop shelves in Finland,   and Denmark. Other European countries will get their share later this year, with the US next in line. “Our goal is that within the next few years, we’ll have a small but intriguing portfolio of spirits. We’re always open to interesting ideas and collaborations, and right now we’re discussing about creating a spirit for a world famous rock band,” Hietalahti says. On top of all this, One Eyed Spirits also offers other services, such creative consultancy and brand design for companies like  . “One thing always leads to another and opportunities can rise out of the blue. You need great ideas, a lot of hard work – and a bit of luck!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/play-safety-rescuebusters/,Play yourself to safety with Rescuebusters,"Many of the world’s most popular games are about shooting, chasing and killing. Finnish SyraWise wanted to create a game that, instead, can save real lives. We’re all an accident away from needing help – and anyone could become a hero. Sometimes it can be the simplest of skills, such as how to behave in the case of fire and how to call emergency services in times of trouble. In order to raise future lifesavers, firefighter and emergency medical technician   began visiting numerous schools teaching children about safety. He couldn’t help but wonder if an hour or two a year is enough to maintain the knowledge. CEO Markus Syrjänen “Jussi figured a game would be a great way to boost the lessons and keep the memories fresh,” says  , CEO of  . The company’s product,  , turns safety education into a game. Developed by Finnish  ,   lets players practise all sorts of situations that might occur at home or in public. What to do when someone is choking or cooking oil catches fire when you’re making doughnuts? “If you think of a lot of popular games, they are about fighting, killing or smashing cars,” Syrjänen notes. “We wanted to make something that does the opposite and teaches how to save lives.” SyraWise was born out of Rautio’s idea and Syrjänen’s business intelligence. Syrjänen is in charge of operations and negotiations, whilst Rautio is the chairman of the board as well as responsible for the game’s content together with partners – and continues to fight for lives in his dayjob. A lot of officials and institutions that work with education and safety have jumped on board to spread the game’s message. SyraWise collaborates with a few schools and teachers in Helsinki, who test   and its new features and provide insightful feedback. Syrjänen points out that it’s to everyone’s benefit that children grow up with both the knowledge and courage to help others. “If you only vaguely remember things from individual lessons in school, you might not be as prone to start acting if you see, for example, a stranger faint on the street. The game lowers the threshold to go help before it’s too late, no matter how big or small the incident is.” A lot of children already spend plenty of time playing games, which can worry some parents – particularly those who don’t fully understand what the game entails. In  ’ case, this is not an issue. “It’s difficult to imagine any parent telling their child to stop playing  ,” Syrjänen points out.  has been of interest abroad, too. According to Syrjänen, inquiries have flown in from Germany, China and Dubai. The game’s strength lies in its neverending potential for expansion. It’s based on a ‘campus’, which enables covering more and more topics simply by adding new areas. The Rescuebusters campus can be expanded to cover all kinds of topics. On top of  , SyraWise is developing a webtool that can be used either independently or in conjunction with the game. It will comprise learning materials, such as ebooks, and, for example, a teacher can add all students’   accounts onto the system and track their playing and points. Companies can adjust the tool to their specific needs, too. Syrjänen explains that an example could be a construction company teaching its employees about company policies and safety instructions. “The tool can be adapted to more grown-up content or branded to include a company’s own characters or mascots.”  is now available in Europe, Japan and South Korea. The webtool will begin its world conquest from the Nordic countries, where it will be sold and distributed by Finnish  , the leading supplier of educational equipment in the region. In addition to educational institutions, SyraWise is looking into collaborating with firms like insurance companies that could use either the game or the webtool to give safety advice to their customers. However, at the core goal is to increase people’s willingness and skills to help themselves, friends and even strangers even in dire situations. “If the game gets one person to save another’s life, like a child knowing how to help a sibling who’s swallowed a piece of Lego, we’ve won,” Syrjänen states. “  wasn’t created by a businessman wanting to make profit but an empathetic firefighter and familyman.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sanako-squeezes-language-labs-pocket-devices/,Sanako squeezes language labs into pocket devices,"Teaching a language by the book is good for reading and writing, but on the streets it’s all about spoken words. Finnish Sanako wants to help language learners listen and speak. In a café near   headquarters,  orders his coffee in fluent Finnish. Nothing in his pronunciation betrays the fact that he was born and raised in Nottinghamshire, UK, and has only moved to Finland as an adult. Yet still, he can neither write nor really read Finnish. At least nowhere near the convincing level of his conversational skills. “I’ve never taken a single lesson. Or well, I did try a reading class, but I still can’t read very well,” he admits laughingly. “I’ve learned Finnish only through listening and speaking.” Barratt is the senior vice president in solutions and services at  , a Finnish educational technology company producing technology and content for language teaching and learning. Sanako’s focus is on using your language skills and particularly on speech. “Learning a language is like learning a new life skill,” Barratt points out. “One can move country, apply for a job and make friends because of it.” Without undermining the importance of knowing grammar and being able to read and write, finding the courage and opportunity to practise speaking and hearing is just as essential – and sometimes more difficult. “In fact, the natural way we learn our own mother tongue is by learning to speak and listen first before we ever learn to read and write,” Barratt explains. “To learn quicker and in a more native way than is possible in a classroom, foreigners also need to sit in a pub and simply listen and talk.” Sanako’s history goes back to the 1970s, when a company then known as Auditek was founded, later owned by Teleste Educational. It specialised and became a world leader in language labs used in schools and other educational institutions – currently in over 110 countries. Sanako Pronounce Live gives the user instant feedback for his or her pronunciation. “The language lab makes learning a lot more effective,” Barratt tells. “Without a language lab, in a class of 30 pupils, one would talk for a minute and listen for 29. With a language lab, they can talk for the full half an hour. It also helps the shyer students practise out loud but in private.” After various happenings and changes in ownership, the name Sanako was registered in 2003. It still sells language labs used by millions of students around the world, but also provides schools with tools and content for language teaching and learning. Now the company is targeting consumers directly as well, without necessarily needing an institution or a teacher. Sanako Pronounce Live, which the company describes as a solution “for situations where learning takes place both inside and outside classrooms and on different devices”, was released last year. The new tool is an addition to Sanako’s existing range of solutions. “Sanako has established two forks: we provide technology with specialism in language learning as well as cool tools that benefit our existing customers and content digitisation technologies and services,” Barratt summarises. In practice, Sanako Pronounce Live is like a language class that can be used either in studying independently or to support formal teaching. The pronunciation tool records speech, gives instant feedback and lets the user choose topics according to their own interests, without having to rely on predetermined content. This leaves more leeway regarding what exercises students can do, as they can copy, paste and practise texts from today’s papers instead of old textbooks. “Students these days don’t want to talk about  , they want to talk about  ,” Barratt says. Sanako is headquartered in Turku, Finland, with a small office located the capital area. Abroad, the company has branches in the US, the UK, Dubai, India, China and Singapore. Some 99 per cent of sales come from outside of Finland. Sanako tools can be used to learn a lot of different languages. In addition to schools and consumers, Sanako collaborates with publishers. Barratt points out that currently ebooks offer little more than a different platform for a book with very few interactive dimensions, but with Sanako’s solutions, publishers can add even more elements to their textbooks. This weaves together a textbook, an exercise book and both listening and speaking exercises. Internationally, Finland is known for its excellent education system. Barratt says that Sanako takes advantage of this reputation, as Finnish education technology is seen as part of the success. At some point, the company is hoping to collaborate with Finnish gaming expertise, too, in the gamification of language learning. There’s just one thing that bugs Barratt about the fame Finland has received in the press: when articles claim Finnish students aren’t given any homework. As a father of two, he knows this isn’t correct. “I think teachers here are just clever with homework. It can either be a little bit every day or long-term projects, where students have to take responsibility for their own schedules.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sweet-success-finland-s-little-chocolate-factory/,Sweet success for Finland’s little chocolate factory,"For Finnish chocolate maker Peter Westerlund the key to great chocolate is no additives except time and creativity.  Inside the  , the rich scent of recently crushed cacao beans is mixed with the sound of a stone mill. Here,   makes chocolate from scratch using only three ingredients: cacao nibs, cane sugar and milk powder. The ecological and handmade bean-to-bar production line gives every chocolate bar a unique flavour. “Compared to mass-produced chocolate, our small-scale approach lets the individual flavour of every bean harvest shine in the chocolate,” Westerlund says. During the production process, he is able to use traditional time-consuming methods without adding or removing anything from the beans. This means that it takes over three months to make each bar of chocolate, and also that the end product stands out from similar treats produced on a large scale. Peter Westerlund fulfilled his dream of making bean-to-bar chocolate and won a prize for his Madagascar milk chocolate. “When I started the business 12 years ago, I only made assorted chocolates and sold other brands, but I soon realised that I wanted to do something you can’t find in every convenience store,” says Westerlund. For a long time, he used a ready-made chocolate paste as the base of his production. However, the real dream was always to produce his own bean-to-bar chocolate, whereby the factory itself takes care of every step of the chocolate production. After 10 years of researching behind the scenes, Westerlund launched his first bean-to-bar product in 2015. Two years later the production was ripe enough to enable him to take some bold steps into the future. In the beginning of 2017, the Little Chocolate Factory Porvoo completely changed its business model by moving to bigger facilities and shifting focus to online sales as well as retailers. Some items were removed from the selection, staff were shed and Westerlund became the sole face of the business. “Some people questioned my decision, but I think it is good to renew yourself from time to time. With the new concept I have time to concentrate on production,” says Westerlund. According to Westerlund, the drastic overhaul has already proven to be successful. Customers are finding his online store without any marketing, and since retailers had been interested already for a while, it has not taken long for the chocolate to reach some of the bigger Finnish stores. A part of the new plan is also to share the knowledge of what handmade chocolate is all about by offering tours in his factory. Since the concept of bean-to-bar chocolate is still very rare in Finland, there is a gap of understanding for the real process behind the tasty treats. These tours are a way for Westerlund to explain the process behind the more expensive price tag. When Westerlund started his business, he was one of only a few chocolate makers in Finland that made such goodies by hand. Now, the local market is a little more crowded. Upon entering the bean-to-bar community in 2015, Westerlund once again took the role of Finnish chocolate front-runner, since only a few chocolatiers in Finland had attempted this before him. Now the Little Chocolate Factory Porvoo offers several bean-to-bar products made from handpicked Brazilian beans or beans from Madagascar that Westerlund sources directly from the farmers. When chocolate is made by hand, the flavour is affected by every detail in the process: roasting the beans, grinding the cacao nibs and letting the chocolate mature before making the final product. The factory also still sells the original goodies made of raw chocolate, alongside some other innovations such as cacao powder especially made to boost your schnapps. When it comes to flavouring, everything from adding spruce needles to smoking the chocolate is possible. “Chocolate is a fascinating raw material that could be made into anything – the sky is the limit,” Westerlund enthuses. Even though bean-to-bar chocolate is new in Finland, it is more common abroad, with similar factories found in Sweden and Iceland, for example. For Westerlund, it is important to keep in contact with these peers to exchange knowledge and ideas. Another way of increasing awareness of his chocolate among his fellow chocolatiers was to participate in the International Chocolate Awards this summer. The result far exceeded Westerlund’s expectations:   in the category of Micro-Batch, Plain Milk Chocolate Bars. “Europe is full of chocolate makers and older companies that have made bean-to-bar chocolates for a long time, so I never thought I would succeed,” says Westerlund. Nevertheless, this international recognition has already brought demand from the German market, which bodes well for any global aspirations the Little Chocolate Factory Porvoo has. Once he has an established a better foothold domestically, Westerlund will look to expand production to meet international needs. Until then, those abroad with a sweet tooth can still get their hands on his chocolate from the web store. Westerlund himself will be in the business as long as his heart is still in it – for a long time, by the sounds of it. “I eat chocolate everyday but still cannot get enough of it. That is also why I do this – I like it so much,” Westerlund says."

CEO    that “sport is the world’s greatest source of passion and enthusiasm… We want to provide a platform where these passions, skills and business sense can meet”. Running without experience or a trainer can easily lead to injuries, a problem that the measurement system Zio by Runteq aims to rectify. Through the collection and analysis of running technique information such as strike impact and bounce, Zio acts as a miniature trainer that fits in your pocket. “It’s a coaching application, combined with a wearable sensor that can help you to run faster, smarter and prevent injury,” CEO    . “It helps you to enjoy running more.” If you have ever dreamed of having a sports bar milieu in your mobile phone, you’re in luck. The “mobile sports bar” lets its users watch games together, and communicate by sending video clips. In the past year, Sportscam raised 1.5 million euros and has partnered with top sports clubs and medias to enhance the game experience. “Sportscam aims to be the biggest social media for sports in the world,” CEO and co-founder   stated  . Here, lights and machine vision cameras are installed above an arena or game area, emitting a wave length of light invisible to the naked eye. The reflections of light allow for the collection of real-time data, and its analysis and distribution. Such data has been useful for tracking different elements of team sports such as player performance and mechanics for both fans and for coaching. “Our technology is exceptional as it provides real time data without the need to install active sensors in the players’ equipment,” explained CEO    . Customised insoles can make a significant difference in a healthy strut, not to mention the benefits to seasoned athletes. Typically, however, ordering insoles is expensive and time-consuming – so this company developed the proficiency to analyse the foot and produce an insole in less than 10 minutes. Founder    il that “I realised that if we could make an insole that would be at least as good, but quicker and cheaper to make, there would be a huge market for it – not only in Finland but internationally”."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/stealthcase-signals-change-phone-reception/,StealthCase signals a change for phone reception,"If you have ever balanced next to an open window just to get mobile signal, Finnish startup StealthCase has some good news for you: time to wave goodbye to poor reception indoors. It all started from a moment of frustration.  ,   founder, had just moved to a new stone house and once again was forced to sit out on the balcony to use his mobile phone as the signal didn’t quite reach indoors. As an antenna specialist at Nokia he started to think something must be done about this. “Later I read an article in [Finnish technology magazine]   on how much energy efficient houses weaken mobile signal and realised this isn’t just me, it’s a widespread problem,” Lilja recalls. A self-declared ‘propeller-head’, Lilja started to test an idea for turning insulation materials, windows and other construction elements into mobile signal boosters. Based on passive antenna technology, his innovation helps mobile signals travel through minuscule gaps in the wall elements which otherwise wouldn’t let the signal through. Consequently, mobile networks can work reliably inside a building without any extra equipment needed. The technology quickly convinced Lilja’s two university friends,   and  , to jump on board and StealthCase was born in late 2014. Today the company has one patent in its pocket, another in the process and the first construction materials featuring its technology are expected to launch later this year. StealthCase targets a growing problem. As building regulations demand more energy efficient construction, mobile signal strength struggles to reach inside walls that have been designed to block thermal radiation. “A modern energy efficient building can weaken a mobile signal 100 times more [20dB] than one built before the 2000s,” Mansikkamäki says. “The same problems arise in older buildings after window renovations.” “We integrate our technology into construction materials,” says Juha Lilja. “Construction companies then buy normal wall and construction materials and, if they come with our stamp, they work as passive antennas. Nothing else needs to be done.” While other companies have tried to solve the issue with internal networks or mobile phone optimised windows, StealthCase argues its approach is cheaper and simpler. The technology is integrated directly into construction materials, doesn’t require any additional setup from the inhabitants, works with any mobile network and window type and doesn’t affect the energy efficiency of a building. StealthCase has already successfully piloted its technology with a few companies, including Finnish rental housing giant VVO. Now the company is in talks with construction material manufacturers interested in licensing its technology and it hopes to announce news regarding this soon. It is also working on a solution to retrofit its technology into existing buildings. “In an optimal situation we would have 10 big manufacturing customers. They gain a competitive advantage from our technology as they can sell mobile device friendly construction materials,” Mansikkamäki explains. “They can ask potential customers if they want to ensure mobile devices work inside their building for the next 20 years or if they want to buy a competitor’s product which doesn’t offer this.” StealthCase is in a good position for a small startup as it has paying customers plus outside backing from Finnish investor  . The company has also secured funding from  , the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, which helps the startup expand its patent portfolio and market reach. StealthCase is already in touch with a few potential European partners and hopes to expand to new markets next year, starting with the wider Nordic region. But this is only the start of the company’s ambitions. “In five years’ time, we aim to be part of 10 to 30 per cent of all buildings constructed or renovated in the Western world,” Mansikkamäki says. “We believe this is possible by partnering up with big manufacturing companies.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/goodlife-technology-rehabilitates-gaming/,GoodLife Technology rehabilitates gaming,"What can Finnish game developers do besides develop games? Quite a lot, actually. In 2013, a healthcare provider and regional development company in Eastern Finland teamed up with the company  . The idea was to see whether games technology could be utilised in healthcare. “The outcome was a Microsoft Kinect-based rehabilitation solution for stroke patients called The Glider,” says  , CEO of  . “The conclusion was that the technology and concept worked well, but mainly due to a lack of scalability there were no business opportunities back then.” There are plenty of business opportunities now, though. GoodLife spun off from Nitro and began showcasing The Glider, where patients repeated certain movements to make rehabilitation seem less of a burden and more fun. The physiotherapy software developer   was impressed enough to ask GoodLife for a new solution. The resulting PT Momentum app is already in use in 130 countries. Henrik Jürgens The future is now looking rosy for GoodLife, having identified a clear need for new consumer-centric solutions which help and motivate patients to comply with their rehabilitation programmes. “While the quality of care and efficacy are always driving the domain, it doesn’t hurt that we have also been able to reduce customer costs and optimise their resource allocations,” Jürgens says. A key revelation the company learned early on was that standalone products will only solve minor parts of a problem and don’t bring in the expected value over the long term. Instead, new digital solutions need to be interoperable with current processes and tools. Jürgens points out that their solutions work seamlessly with patient identification, PhysioTools exercise programmes and video-based virtual care solutions, for example. “Our primary target audience are physical rehabilitation providers like hospitals and clinics,” he continues. “Currently our main customers are from Finland. We believe we need to have solid references and results from our home market to scale our business abroad.” GoodLife Technology has been extensively networking, being one of the first five Finnish companies to join the global StartUp Health programme as well as the EU Horizon 2020 project  , a major pilot on smart living environments. This hard work has paid off and they caught the eye of authorities at a new high-tech healthcare project. GoodLife is now working on a state-of-the-art solution for the city of Espoo, Finland. “Currently we are developing a motion sensor-based rehabilitation solution which will be used in the most modern new rehabilitation hospital in Europe later this year,” says Jürgens. “The aim is to help Espoo’s new hospital to raise the activity time of their patients up to six hours per day. “Patients needing rehabilitation can carry out their personal exercise programmes with the help of our rehabilitation kiosk whenever it is most suitable for them, even when the therapist is not personally present.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/happysignals-makes-good-mood-a-currency/,HappySignals makes good mood a currency,"Saving a euro here can add costs elsewhere. Finnish HappySignals has calculated a price for employee happiness and wants to make it a global trend. Pretty much everyone in the office hates calling IT support. Printer not working? Webmail stuck? There’s never a fun reason to contact the IT folks. Things get even more frustrating when one doesn’t receive an immediate response or the first point of contact doesn’t know what to do and transfers the call to someone else – and the explaining starts all over again. CEO Sami Kallio “People can feel like tennis balls, bouncing from one person to the next,” says  , CEO of  . “It’s a comparison I’ve heard various times from several people.” The same goes with in-house HR and finance requests. Plenty of productive working hours are wasted, let alone the frustration that takes the edge off people’s good mood. Kallio should know: HappySignals has collected data from employees of big companies asking about the things that do their heads in the most when it comes to internal processes. Speed, or rather the lack of it, is the number one annoyance by a clear margin, followed by the need to explain problems numerous times. This is what HappySignals has set out to change. The company wants to improve the happiness levels of employees at both ends of the spectrum. It’s not only about soft values, pillows and hearts; all of it can be converted into hard currency. Companies have tried hard to save cash on support functions by outsourcing them, sometimes to far-away lands with lower wages. Kallio says that this isn’t automatically a bad choice to make. The problem is that the savings are looked at from the wrong angle. “A ticket cost of 15 euros can look cheap, but looking at the internal costs altogether, it can actually mean 150 euros go down the drain in lost working hours,” Kallio explains. Although service speed of course matters, HappySignals’ focus is on employee experience. It wants to support companies to provide its employees with the best kind of service, be it in-house or outsourced, to smoothen their working days. After each ticket, employees are sent a questionnaire that is used to finalise the process, give feedback to the support staff and collect information that will be used to improve the service. To ensure action points are actually utilised, HappySignals offers the first analysis as a part of the implementation process. “We want everything to be easy and actionable for all parties,” Kallio points out. “Few people get excited about questionnaires, but if you know they’ll be listened to, you’re much more inclined to respond.” Unmeasurable wellbeing isn’t everything: the 15 to 150 euros thinking is HappySignals’ selling point in the global market. As the company targets firms with over 1 000 employees, the extent of savings catches executive attention. HappySignals also monitors cultural differences in Happiness Scores. On top of continuously collecting feedback and data from employees and service providers, HappySignals has also compiled what is calls  : a list of anonymous results from its customer companies. This way, HappySignals users can see how they’re doing in comparison to other firms and learn from each other’s best practices. Firms can also use their high score as a competitive advantage in, for example, recruitment. This summer, HappySignals was chosen for the Microsoft accelerator programme Turbopump. Next, Kallio is moving to the UK to conquer the market from within. Although currently the majority of customers are Finland-based companies, now half of new orders come from abroad. The best option would be to find partners to ride with. The wave of the trend is definitely growing. “The change has been radical,” Kallio says. “It wasn’t long ago when companies were saying ‘workers always complain anyway’. Now they see the value, including financial, of keeping staff happy and loyal.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-internationalisation/,Five for Friday: Internationalisation,"Finnish innovations take many forms and sizes – imagine everything from dried grasshopper snacks to roof-building robots and energy created from used tires. Now it’s time to go global! Organised by  , the annual Team Finland Day on 24 August brought together 600 Finnish companies with one thing in common: an interest in internationalisation. “A product development process should never end with having a great finished product in your hand but with selling this product abroad,” says Finland’s Minister for Foreign Trade and Development,  . The event sought to shine a light on gaining a foothold on global markets, with Team Finland’s expert network opening doors to international sales, export funding and funding from abroad. Established companies were on hand to share their stories of making a global impact, along with those about to take their first steps on new markets. Here’s but a handful of the companies that caught our eye. First emerging in 1987, today this company is one of the biggest in the Nordic and Baltic countries, with a strong presence in Europe, Asia and US. Offering a wide range of research and consultation services in medicine, food and nutrition, the aim is to find efficient, safe and cost-effective healthcare products. “It is worth first establishing yourself abroad, where the markets often are more open to new things, and then go back to the Finnish market,” advises managing director  . “The competition is tough, so you have think big and remove the typical Finnish modesty. Customers won’t knock on your door so you have to have the courage to go out there and network.” In March, Medfiles took a bold new step and was  . The company still has a strong Finnish identity and its European headquarters are located in Kuopio. Also known as Entis, these five entrepreneurs are riding the nutritious and ecological insect wave and seek to put delicious Finnish creepy-crawlies on dining tables. They want to be part of a food revolution and are inviting everyone to join them. For Entis, insects offers endless possibilities of variation and after only three months of operations they have managed to get onto the shelves of several retailers and have already received an order from abroad. “Our plan is to first establish ourselves on the Finnish market and then take on Central Europe – but it can be changed of course,” says co-founder . This company’s values and goals make developing countries in Africa and Asia the perfect market. Nocart offers power management units, systems and power, producing environmentally conscious energy from a variety of innovative energy sources. These include waste from agriculture production or even used tires that often end up laying dormant in big piles. Earlier this year you could read about the company’s success in,  . “It is important to have contacts and presence in the country as well as patience – and then more patience,” says the managing director  . “We are all about new ways to create energy and when establishing yourself globally you have to be able to think about your plans and markets in a different way than in Finland.” These revolutionary automatic production lines for the roof truss industry take care of 75 per cent of the building process. “We have a unique product that does not require human labour,” says managing director  . “This means that the machine is an efficient investment on a long term basis.” Today they are just about to enter the North American and European markets and the Team Finland Day is a way for them to get hands-on information about the sales in these markets. For them, the US market is a perfect fit with some 1.2 million new building projects up for grabs. Highlighting the unique produce that the Finnish nature has to offer, this blueberry soda is made of local blueberries and contains less sugar than normal soda. “Finnish blueberries are filled with vitamins and antioxidants and we want to bring a new form of them to the global market that is different to how you normally consume blueberries,” says the production manager  . The company has (similarly to Entis) received a significant amount of help from   to get going. After appearing at Team Finland Day last year, I’m Blue has since established itself in the Finnish market. Its goal is to now enter the global market via Thailand and Singapore, where they have established important contacts with ambassadors through the Team Finland Day event."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-games-score-highly-china/,Finnish games score highly in China,"The Chinese gaming industry sees potential in the high quality and creativity of Finnish games. This is creating some interesting opportunities. Given Finland’s population of 5.5 million, unsurprisingly export has always been the main market for its games studios. The success of the industry is well known. In fact, today   all around the world have played Finnish games. One market that is ripe for further development is China, the fastest growing mobile market in the world. In China, the success of   and   has especially paved the way for other Finnish game studios to make their mark. The global success of Finland’s mobile games means that it stands out when Chinese companies increasingly look to Europe for new games to bring to their market. KooPee Hiltunen, the director of Neogames, predicts that the Finnish gaming industry will continue growing. “Many Chinese investors think that the Finnish product is really creative, but the Finnish companies don’t know how to operate in China,” says  , the secretary general of Hangzhou Animation Comic and Game Association. “So, Chinese companies can help with this by bringing the Finnish games to China.” Different types of networking events have proven to be crucial in bringing these parties together. The most recent gathering was organised in August by the   China team, together with the non-profit umbrella organisation for Finnish games,  . Here, several Chinese companies demonstrated their interest in bringing different types of Finnish games to the Chinese market. “With games it all comes down to entertainment and the Finnish game studios have managed to find the type of content that the Chinese want to consume,” says  , director of Neogames. “The playability of the games is one thing that directly affects the interest in a game.” Even though the Finnish gaming industry is small compared to China, the Finnish studios have a technological advantage when making games. This means that the Finnish companies are flexible and able to develop games for almost any platform. Among the Finnish studios attending the event and wanting to expand in China was  , a team of Finnish professionals  . “We are renewing the way of making games in the same way music and photographing has been disrupted when moving to digital publishing methods,” says the company’s CEO and co-founder,  . “We are making the next generation of game development tools.” Their unique tools, named 3rd Eye Core, together with their unique technology team will allow fast and cost-efficient game design for VR but also other platforms such as mobile and PC. This gives the company a competitive advantage on the Asian market. The company is currently piloting a toolkit in China and Japan, which is set to become more widely available in the beginning of next year. This is also when the studio will launch its first big VR game. One company helping to bring international companies to the Chinese market is  , a Finnish-Chinese startup that has been crucial to the success of  ’s world renowned game   and  ‘   in the Far East. “The real world and the virtual world are moving closer to each other,” says Koivistoinen. “We believe that mixed reality and virtual reality will become normal in most fields.” With VR still waiting for its big breakthrough in Finland, in contrast China is much further down the development line in this area of games. Compared to the Western market where the focus lies on high quality headsets and equipment, the Chinese are consuming their virtual reality elsewhere. “In China they already have thousands of VR cafés and game spots where people go to play together,” says Koivistoinen. This means that Asia is the main market for 3rd Eye Studios and it has already found important investors from China. Now the company is searching for local contacts that can help it publish both their games and their tools on the market. According to the company’s co-founder and head of operations,  , it is crucial to find a local person with the right contacts and a good reputation to make it in China. She believes the cooperation between these two countries is a perfect match. “Finland and China have a very good relationship in many areas and I believe both nations have the similar kind of straightness that makes it easy to work together,” says Johansson. “I look forward to this co-operation.” 3rd Eye Studios are keen to get into the Chinese market where there passion for VR can continue to grow.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cancer-survivors-relieved-by-healthy-life-devices/,Cancer survivors relieved by Healthy Life Devices,"Finnish healthtech company Healthy Life Devices has developed a unique solution to treat the pain and swelling of lymphoedema. About 140 million people around the world suffer from an incurable condition. This is lymphoedema, localised fluid retention and tissue swelling due to a compromised lymphatic system. Although it is incurable, one Finnish company has created an innovative solution which can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions of sufferers. “Our patented device uses negative pressure to activate the lymph system and reduce swelling,” explains  , CEO of  . “It reduces swelling more effectively than the current standard of care, and also reduces manual stress on the therapist.” Lymphoedema can be an inherited condition, but it is also caused by other factors. In the developing world it can be the result of parasites, while it is often seen in developed nations as a result of cancer treatments. Breast cancer survivors are particularly prone to it. During cancer surgery lymph nodes are sometimes removed, or they can be damaged by chemical or radiation therapy. The lymphatic system no longer carries fluid effectively, and the result is painful swelling and a loss of mobility. Healthy Life Devices has developed two products to alleviate this condition: LymphaTouch and PhysioTouch. They can also be used in muscle care for athletes or to treat sports injuries. After treatment with the devices swelling and pain can be reduced while the range of motion can be improved. Given that the globe is grabbling with the same condition, its no surprise to discover that the company has set its sights abroad. The company plans to expand in the US market and around the world. “When I became CEO in 2011 about 95 per cent of our business was in Finland,” Palomäki continues. “Now 90 per cent are exports. We are selling to China, Australia, the UK, Germany and of course Finland. About 70 per cent of our business is in the US.” North America has been an enthusiastic believer in LymphaTouch and PhysioTouch. Healthy Life Devices counts some of the largest and most prestigious hospitals in the country as clients, including Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, which often treats Washington politicians, and LA’s famous Cedar Sinai, which is the hospital of choice for Hollywood celebrities. And how has the company managed to get themselves noticed at such prestigious locales? Healthy Life Devices has a unique sales model: they send hospitals one of its devices to try out for free. “They get it for a 30-day free trial, and if they like it they can buy it,” Palomäki explains. “We’ve closed a large number of these deals. We even got the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Hospital as clients this way. They have been consistently ranked as the top cancer hospital in the USA.” Not only are Healthy Life Devices actively courting healthcare providers, they also found demand from an unexpected source. “We started out serving professionals, but a few years ago a patient contacted me and said she wanted to buy a device,” says Palomäki. “She had received treatment in a hospital and liked it so much she wanted a device for home therapy. We figured out how to make this happen so now sell to both hospitals and patients.” The company continues to grow, helped by not having any direct competitors. Other methods to treat lymphoedema include physical therapy, compression bandages and complicated pneumatic pressure therapies. Healthy Life Devices are certain they have a better method to treat this debilitating condition. “We have a perfected solution and good funding behind us,” Palomäki says. “We’ll continue to expand in the US market and around the world.”"

Last week, Finnfacts organised a media tour for South Korean journalists, in cooperation with  ’s  , to delve into the mindset behind the intimate relationship between nature and the companies turning wild ingredients into versatile food and beverage products. “The Food From Finland growth programme helps Finnish food companies in their internationalisation and access to global markets,” says program manager  . “The recent 15 per cent growth in food and beverage exports shows that we are on the right track.” We had a chat with five companies that are transforming traditional Finnish ingredients into inventive delights that echo an understanding of reciprocity among environmental responsibility, ingredient quality, human wellbeing and product taste. Founded in 1981 by  , nowadays this traditional family company is run by his son  , producing fresh, frozen and dried berries; jams and drinks; along with wild mushrooms. All products are first hand-picked and then processed as little as possible to savour the natural nutrients, vitamins and taste within. “Pure, clean and wild nature guarantees the purity of our ingredients,” says Pekka. “Forests, often hundreds of years old, are the most natural and safe growing ground for all our products. The long summer days provide the ingredients a unique taste.” After working as a chef,   moved to Levi, one of the cleanest environments in the world, and began to realise the potential around him. With an ambitious mindset to find the perfect pairings of berries, vegetables and wild herbs, Kurtti uses hefty amounts of ingredients to make healthy snackbars The 60 berries that go into one snackbar are chosen with the upmost care and criteria from the wild. Jari is motivated by the challenges of creativity to ensure product quality, healthiness and ecological prowess. “At the time of founding the company, there were no similar products with Finnish ingredients,” Kurtti recalls. “After stumbling upon the potential in Lapland, it took a vigorous process of getting it right. The modern values of wellbeing, sustainability and yearning for a break from the hustle and bustle of city life are intrinsic in our products.” This company produces a superfood drink made from berries, honey and wholegrain oats – all organic. The berries grow naturally in the forest where they have the best soil and Arctic climate to produce nutrient rich ingredients. The products are designed for people who care about sustainability as well as their personal health, combining two global consumer trends. “Aberry is a 100 per cent natural energy drink for people who like to know the story of their food from wild nature to their breakfast table,” says co-founder and marketing director  .  and   founded Lyotech in 2011 and quickly harnessed their strong academic background to develop a pioneering freeze drying method. The result is NatureDry technology, a fast and low-temperature freeze drying method that preserves the flavours and nutrients of berries in an advanced way. The company has been valued at a nine-figure sum. Lyotech’s   product line includes freeze dried berries that are characterised by a premium combination of texture, taste and nutrients. “The idea to apply our technology to berries was natural to us, since we spend a lot of time in the Lapland wilderness and appreciate the unique ingredients it has to offer,” says Henri. “Our technology preserves 97 per cent of the berries’ nutrients and does it 90 times faster than, for example, NASA.” Moreover, the conventional limitations of freeze drying do not apply to the NatureDry technology. What started out as an Arctic wild berry project is now set to be applied to all food products. The company is looking for market opportunities for its Joy of North products as well as its technology.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nosto-gets-personal-e-commerce/,Nosto gets personal about e-commerce,"Ever wondered how an online store chooses the products it recommends to you? Nosto has the answer. In four years, the Finnish company has grown into a veritable e-commerce giant with customers in 167 countries.  Online shopping is a huge business with an estimated global value of   US dollars. No wonder retailers are constantly searching for ways to make the digital experience smoother, more engaging and personalised. This is where   and its self-titled product steps in. In 2013 it became the first company in the world to launch a platform-independent e-commerce personalisation tool. “We thought online stores should be inspiring places where you can find relevant products, instead of just scrolling through an online catalogue,” says  , Nosto’s co-founder. “What we today offer is a personalised shopping experience across several different channels and devices.” “The big trends in e-commerce are mobile and multi-device use,” says Juha Valvanne. “Multi-channel presence is increasingly important to online retailers, but also makes their operational environment more complex.” This is provided by Nosto’s cloud-based software. An online retailer can easily set up the software themselves and use it to automate personalised recommendations across all their channels from the web and mobile sites to Facebook and Instagram. The more data Nosto’s algorithms collect on shoppers’ behaviour, the better its recommendations get. The idea for Nosto came from Valvanne’s own experiences in e-commerce. After founding several successful online stores and advising others, he grew increasingly frustrated with the existing marketing tools. “If you had a good salesperson in a physical store, they could easily identify a customer’s needs and recommend products, but this wasn’t possible online,” Valvanne recalls. “We started to think how this ‘super salesman’ could be transferred into the online world.” When Valvanne speaks of ‘we’ he is referring to Nosto’s co-founders   and  . The trio found a way to use customer data to automate product recommendations, but problems arose when they wanted to make their product platform-independent and easy to implement. “We wanted to make it work with any technology your online store is built upon,” Valvanne explains. “But it was quite a challenge. We built the product in seven different ways before we got there. We felt we had achieved something really cool.” This feeling solidified after the trio commissioned research on not breaching patents. The findings? They had an unique technology on their hands. Nosto was founded soon afterwards, in mid-2011, to develop the technology further. Today Nosto’s technology is protected with two patents and holds the   in personalisation globally. The company is also the ‘preferred partner’ of some of the biggest e-commerce platforms in the world, including Shopify Plus and Magento, and in April it was made an official marketing partner by Facebook. Nosto has no problems with visibility. Global markets were Nosto’s target from the start. It quickly expanded from its headquarters in Helsinki to London, Berlin, Stockholm and New York and is opening its second US office soon. Valvanne believes physical presence is crucial even in today’s digital markets. “Internationalisation takes a lot of footwork,” he explains. “To succeed in different markets, you really have to be able to live and breath those markets.” Nosto already has users around the globe, but in future it hopes to invest more in Asia, Latin America and the US. An extra boost for these plans came in June, when the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted the company 15 million euros in loan-based funding. This is earmarked for market expansion, product development and growing its 100-strong team. “The way consumers meet and engage with brands and buy products is changing fast,” Valvanne says. “If we play our cards right, we can build very interesting solutions on top of our current product and data.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/claned-gives-finnish-learning-a-global-audience/,Claned gives Finnish learning a global audience,"What do you get when you combine machine learning algorithms with Finnish educational skills? A learning platform automatically tailored to every user’s individual needs.  You could say it all started in India. In 2011,  , founder of  , was visiting the populous subcontinent with a Finnish business delegation and heard the local minister of education talk about the need for a smart learning system to train one million nurses. “I started talking with     [Claned Group CEO] whether should we build this,” Perälä recalls. “We had both seen and analysed many educational projects so we knew what would work. We decided to start building an analytics-based learning system designed with the end-users in mind, whether they are students, employees or lifelong learners.” This is now the philosophy behind the company’s cloud-based learning platform, also called ‘Claned’. Launched in 2016 it combines Finnish pedagogical research, artificial intelligence and social media features to give each user a learning experience that best suits their needs. They can find and interact with like-minded learners, collaborate on study topics and receive material recommendations personalised for their learning styles. Claned says its platform suits schools, universities and corporations alike and has the references to back this up. The company counts Microsoft, the   and European Olympic Committee among its customers. “We want to help people better understand how they learn,” says Vesa Perälä. “Pedagogics are very important to us and this is what many other services lack.” The company has also   in India, where it all started, and will soon be used by nearly two million students in 2 000 schools across the country. Behind Claned’s appeal is its strong pedagogical focus. The company has worked closely with Finnish universities to build its algorithms based on validated research regarding how individuals learn. “You get motivated by different things than I do and our motivation varies during a day,” Perälä says. “Bit by bit our system starts to understand the learning factors affecting how a certain user learns and how their learning experience can be personalised and improved.” It is a major step forward from the ‘one-size fits all’ thinking of traditional learning platforms. In fact, Claned sees itself as a learning analytics company. “No one else offers the analytics we produce on people, organisations and content,” Perälä explains. “Many services measure how many times an article was opened, but what we measure is if people actually learn something from that article.” Although Claned was only launched a year ago, the platform already has customers in 15 countries, including Singapore and the US. This has taken plenty of legwork, but the company has also benefitted from Finland’s reputation as an education superpower. “It doesn’t secure deals, but it does open doors… Nowadays I introduce myself by saying, ‘Hi, I’m Vesa from Finland and we have the best education system in the world.’ And then I explain what this has to do with Claned,” Perälä says with a laugh. But the crucial element in Claned’s fast internationalisation is its digital nature. This where Perälä believes Finnish education industry still has lessons to learn. He stresses the future of education exports is digital, as truly global businesses need to be easily scalable. No matter how many great teachers you have, they cannot be in many places simultaneously. Claned practices what it teaches. Among its biggest customers is school organisation  , which has brought Claned almost 100 000 users, but the company secured the deal without ever visiting Australia. Perälä also believes computers will soon give way to mobile as the dominant learning platform. “People in China, India and Latin America aren’t walking around with a MacBook Air, but with an affordable Android phone,” he says. “The benefit for us is that we can offer anyone in the world a personalised study package on their own phone. By 2020 70 percent of the world’s population will have a smartphone. That is quite a few people for us to help.” Claned works with all study materials as long as they are in a digital format. Its machine learning algorithms analyse and index the content to know which ones suit each user best."

Under the theme of “Tomorrow’s home”, this year’s   seeks to highlight the changing definition of home. Whilst still a safe zone, the space in itself can be something temporary, mobile, shared or virtual. This premise is delivered not only by the hundreds of companies attending the event but also via special exhibitions that challenge the audience to think about the terms ‘home’ and ‘lifestyle’ from a broader perspective. Habitare is a unique celebration of design and at the same time the perfect springboard to Finnish and global markets. For you who cannot attend the event yourselves, no worries! We brought our camera along to the scene to share the buzz with you. ’s stand lights up the event with a bunch of design items, such as the flower lamp designed by   and the indecisive coat hanger “ ” designed by  . Another brand new product launched at the fair is a chair with an inbuilt sound system that only the person in the chair can hear, creating a disturbance-free music moment. “We use a unique method of manufacturing that makes it possible to bend the veneer in a new way and add elements into the material,” says  , the designer of the chair and founder of the company. For Formaloft, 1 + 1 = 3! In this simple formula, a window divides one room into three spaces by playing with the see-through effect of the glass. “The window brings something unique to a space and can give structure also to small apartments,” says   (right) who founded the company one year ago together with  .

This fresh design piece made by   is a sample of the unique art and furniture found in Lokal gallery and shop. The cupboard is a unique playful “mystery box” that can be opened from all angles – if you figure out how. Lokal is a world renowned company that presents independent Finnish art, design and crafts with the philosophy of bringing forth long term and sustainable design. A world-first launched at Habitare! Desiot’s   (left) and , see opportunities in the upcoming trend of virtual reality. They believe that the high-tech equipment will become more popular for home use, which will create a need for a completely new type of design. As a first aesthetic addition to this digital development, these guys came up with a rack for virtual reality headsets. “Expensive equipment needs a good rack to sit on,” says Veikkeli. “The environments of virtual reality and the reality we live in create an interesting interface that can be brought to interior decoration.” This massive trailer has been filled with real rubble from destroyed Syrian homes creating a tangible symbol of homelessness and refugeehood. The contemporary artwork, called  , was commissioned by the Finnish Cultural Institute for the Benelux and made by artist  . “The trailer emphasises how people’s homes have travelled to a new place,” says Pulkkinen highlighting the difference to merely just showing the ruins. Today, physical paper and writing letters can offer a counterbalance to the highly digitalised world. This, together with a love of paper as a material, makes the foundation for Papershop. Their stand at Habitare is crowded with people interested in handpicked Finnish design as well as English products signed ‘London Rifle’. Among the novelties in the selection is a bunch of calendars for the rapidly approaching new year. “At the moment we are also developing our own production so next year we will probably showcase our own products,” says the owner,  . MUJIs first ever pop up store in Finland came to Habitare together with its chairman  , the international friend of this year’s event. MUJI’s presence at the fair was another reason for one of the biggest Japanese newspapers, Yomiuri, to travel to the event. Their reporter  , attended Habitare through a media tour organised by Finnfacts.  “Nordic furniture and lifestyle is very popular in Japan but people are not that familiar with Finnish lifestyle, so this is an opportunity to showcase that,” says Shima who is also here to conduct interviews with Finnish healthcare companies. “Everything was smoothly organised for me so I’m very thankful.” Skanno is back at Habitare! This year, displaying a fresh selection of the French brand Ligne Roset which is a perfect mix of Scandinavian style and high fashion. “The design is ascetic but then there is always the standout treats like this red sofa by renowned Bouroullec brothers,” says decorator  . Skanno has formed a bridge between international and Finnish design for decades and are attending the fair after a break of many years. “The event has got a real facelift so we decided to join again,” says Hietaranta. The design deed of the year goes to FRENN! This brand is on a mission to reinvent Finnish menswear and the uniqueness lies in the free style of dressing –  clothes can be worn for both work and leisure.

Innovation is ambitiously encouraged in Finland, with events often tailored to selected audiences. One such scheme is the  , an ‘idea accelerator’ that applauds science through competition. With a broad orientation to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, it is designed to improve global inequalities. Consolidating research with business, the competition supports ideas that vary from commercial to pioneering research. The   were selected in June, and the winner receiving 375 000 euros is announced in November.  Check out the teams who have innovation down to a science – and decide who you think should take home the prize. The number five is a little restrictive in this context, so behold our very first Five (+2) for Friday! Helping schools to facilitate the teaching of global competences and develop pedagogies relevant to globalisation is the intent of this finalist. The team targets competences such as collaboration, social engagement, problem solving, resilience, emotion regulation and multicultural understanding. “The aim is to develop a holistic solution including an experience sampling application with which students can evaluate competences they need in their everyday life,” explains team leader, professor  . “The second part of our solution is a competence wall that collects information from individual students’ applications to be utilised when evaluating the progress of learning global competencies collectively with students and teachers.” After studying three-dimensioned net printing and the psychology of mosquitos, this team developed Elmo: a method of elimination of mosquito-mediated diseases by trapping mosquitos inside two nets. Pursuing wide-scale use of the nets, the goal is to reduce malaria globally. “We started to think about possibilities of the physical structures for mosquitos coming in on one side of a net and not coming back out, reducing the numbers of mosquitos by night,” describes team member, professor  . “It [addresses] a very important global problem; we want to serve and help in that.” Chosen by the audience in June, this team uses 3D printing technology to construct a functional mini-kidney. By consolidating fields of biology, bio-pharmacy, biomaterial research, engineering and business, the aim is to fix the shortage of organs. Team leader   explains that “bio-printing is a hot topic right now in the world. It gives us the possibility to arrange cells grown as single cells with other types of cells, in a 3D structure. We aim to copy nature’s way of building a kidney.” One of the most pressing questions regarding the utility of renewable energy is its storage. Such a solution would also allow access to excess energy that is produced and wasted today. This team addresses these concerns – in doing so combating climate change – by creating novel materials for thermal storage. “I got an idea – and funding – to start developing completely new materials which could be utilised not only in small but also in large scale applications,” explains team leader, senior scientist  . “Now we have made two material innovations for this purpose.” Each patient’s cancer is unique. For a patient that does not respond to standard chemotherapy, this team seeks to create a tool for predicting a customised drug combination therapy by investigating his or her genetic data. The predicted treatment option will be evaluated in a drug screening experiment on the patient’s cancer sample, the results of which may greatly help the decision making in clinics. “This ‘data-driven medicine’ is what we believe to be the future of healthcare in cancer,” says team leader  . “The drug screening experiments using patients’ samples are very cost-effective, and could be potentially translated to clinical applications for improving cancer precision medicine.” This team wants to improve the commended Finnish maternity box, by including information cards on mental health issues and setting up a corresponding electronic platform. The toolkit can be exported through international organisations and companies who want to offer employees extra health and social care. “There are a number of families lacking basic knowledge on how to raise a child – perhaps it’s the first baby that they’re holding in their arms,” describes team member, professor  . “Our idea is to give a basic, easy access, evidence based toolkit.” Wouldn’t it be useful for patients to test themselves for microbes at different stages of a disease? This team wants to increase health awareness by transforming the diagnostic platform. “We want to put the power of diagnostics in the hands of the patients,” explains team leader Dr.  . “There’s a lot of rapid testing in different things – the way this is done needs to be improved and microbes is the way to do it.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-wooden-case-that-won-t-bend-to-the-market-s-will/,A wooden case that won’t bend to the market’s will,"Finnish company Lastu started out by taking an artisan approach to protecting smartphones, which has since seen demand for its products outweigh supply. Six years since the launch of their mobile phone accessory business, the two founders of  ,   (CEO) and   (chairman of the board), are facing an enviable problem – one that is indicative of a world where there are more active mobile devices than there are people. Demand is exceeding supply. “We recently moved our production to a bigger space 10 kilometres from the city of Oulu,” Patopuro, a young yet seasoned entrepreneur, explains. “But given the kind of production we’re running, scaling up has its challenges.” It’s precisely the sustainable, artisan values which made Lastu such hot property in the first place that lie at the root of its growing pains – principles they’re not willing to compromise. Around 70 per cent of the production of its phone cases is carried out by skilled woodwork artisans (with a machine laser cutting the initial wooden slivers, and the externally-sourced silicon edging, making up the remaining 30 per cent). Artisans treat the wood five times over with beeswax (among other natural waxes), before fitting and finishing each piece. What’s more, 30–40 per cent of orders comprise of customised phone/laptop cases, which can bring the number of products a woodworker produces per day down to as few as 10. Thankfully, the beginnings of a blueprint which struck the two founders six years ago had legs. “The birth of Lastu was a culmination of a lot of different factors,” Patopuro elaborates. “As early as 2011, Finns were spending upwards of 600 euros on cutting edge mobile phone technology, but frittering away 5–10 euros on a mass-produced and synthetic case.” Sakari Arffman (left) and Jussi Patopuro, two entrepreneurs based in Oulu, are driven to make products that they themselves would want to use. This incongruity ignited a spark of inspiration. “There wasn’t anyone else making phone cases that had intrinsic value: cases made of natural, sustainable materials that felt good to the touch,” Patopuro recalls. “We’ve never produced anything we wouldn’t proudly use ourselves.” But they didn’t just want their products to feel good – they wanted them to do good, too. Behind the company’s success has been the sustained commitment to imbue their products with values consistent with their natural materials. As is the case with their design processes (which are award winning and have led to interesting recent innovations), here the materials lead the way. “In Finland, using wood is a genuinely ethical way to produce merchandise,” Patopuro says. “The supply chains are sustainable, we use wood from certified forests and never resort to species of trees that are endangered.” Unlike some bamboo phone cases available on the market, the duo is committed to investigating its supply chains regardless of the material used. “It helps that all our materials come from Finland, other than the fish scales which we source from Iceland, a by-product of the fishing industry,” Patopuro outlines. “But that’s a design we’re still developing.” With an annual turnover of around 300 000 euros and five employees, the drive for sustainability seems to be working. Lastucase.com has been known to take those efforts even further, for example by working with organisations such as Greenpop, a tree-planting project in Zambia. Currently, five per cent of the product price goes to WWF’s efforts to  . Patopuro emphasises that the company’s holistic approach resonates with a growing customer group that seeks meaning in everything they do. “Most days we spend more time touching our smartphones than we do our significant other,” he says. “We wanted to help make one of the most important items you own that little bit closer to nature and thereby to humanity too. It’s a quality product you’re holding in your hand.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lyyti-puts-event-management-order/,Lyyti puts event management in order,"Behind closed doors event management is often a jungle of emails, spreadsheets and last-minute changes. Finnish company Lyyti has made its mission to bring order to this chaos. The first thing  , founder of  , makes clear is that he likes to talk about participant – not event – management. “There are millions of events organised around the world that aren’t considered as events. For example, employee training sessions, educational courses or even swimming schools,” he lists. “But all of these have participants and data related to them that needs to be collected, managed and shared.” This is the focus of Lyyti and its self-named event management software. It can be used for any type of event to create branded event pages and apps, manage registrations, tickets and feedback and share information both externally and internally. Most importantly the cloud-based software can be integrated with a company’s existing IT infrastructure. A typical example, Hollmén says, is a company’s internal training calendar. When an employee signs up for an event Lyyti automatically transfers the information to the company’s HR system. No copy-pasting or emailing needed. “Most companies want this kind of data to smoothly move between their different systems,” Hollmén explains. “This is something no-one else really offers.” Lyyti is used to organise over 50 000 events annually. About half of them are internal company training events. Hollmén knows how chaotic event organising can be. In 2006, he was organising a small customer event for a travel company he worked for, but only had a few registrations with a week to go. “I thought let’s try email,” Hollmén recalls. “I collected all our customers details onto a spreadsheet and sent out 4 000 invites. Within a day we got 2 000 replies.” The event was a success, but replying to thousands of emails and managing all participant details on a spreadsheet was a nightmare. After the dust had settled, Hollmén decided the process had to be automated. He looked for existing solutions, but found they were either very expensive or limited in their functionalities. So Hollmén started a side project to create one himself. A year later, in 2008, the first version of Lyyti was launched. Hollmén targeted the service only at small and mid-sized companies, but he was in for surprise. A survey of Finnish meeting organisers of all sizes revealed 95 per cent still relied on emails and spreadsheets for participant management. The demand for Lyyti was proven. “Our third customer was the Population Register Center of Finland,” Holmen recalls. “They had found our website and called me. I thought it was a prank. But I went to the meeting and in the reception I finally believed it was real.” Over the years Lyyti has made it onto the list of Finland’s   and added big names such as BMW and Samsung to its 700 customers. Now the company’s sights are firmly set on European expansion. In addition to 34 people in Finland, the company already has a sales office in Sweden and in May launched its first  . “The agency sells Lyyti exclusively and the results have been really good,” Hollmén enthuses. “We have come to the conclusion that a local operator with good local networks and market knowledge is our best option. It is our internationalisation strategy going forward.” Lyyti is also banking on the upcoming EU data protection directive GDPR, which takes force in 2018 and stipulates how data is handled in Europe. The company believes being compliant with the regulation gives it an advantage over American competitors. Furthermore, it’s another way to keep customers happy. “We want to be a technology firm that puts service at the front and centre,” Hollmén explains. “ A third of our staff work in customer and consulting services. We don’t need to be the biggest, but we want to be the most respected participant data management platform in the world.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gloet-seeks-add-extra-spark/,Glöet seeks to add an extra spark,"Special occasions deserve special toasts, don’t you think? Finnish Glöet wants to boost traditional festivities with innovatively flavoured bubbles. Christmas five years ago.   and   had stumbled across a recipe that combined Finnish mulled wine   and sparkling wine, and the couple decided to spice up their evening shindig with friends by raising this different kind of toast. “Everyone thought it was delicious,” Juha-Matti Raunio says. “It had the best of both: the celebratory feeling of sparkling wine and the Christmassy and sweet taste of glögi.” Soon after Christmas, he shared the thought with co-founder  , who immediately got excited. They started searching on Google for similar, ready-made drinks. It turned out that none were available – anywhere. Could there be an empty spot on the shelves, perhaps? The founders: Juha-Matti and Anetter Raunio and Theodor Arhio Through personal connections, Raunio got hold of  , a renowned Finnish wine connoisseur, and presented the idea to him. Berglund’s initial reaction was blunt. “As someone who focusses on organic, ‘real’ wines, he thought it sounded horrible,” Raunio tells laughingly. “But he did recognise the commercial potential and told me I should talk to other wine experts,   and  .” Salonen and Rinta-Huumo were instantly on board. Many a recipe were tested, and number 16 was finally what the team had been looking for. Now, the product is mass produced in Spain – so again, the best of both worlds. “  blends Finnish design and innovation with Spanish tradition and skills in wine making,” Raunio explains. This year will be the third Christmas running that Glöet is available for Finnish consumers. In the first year, 30 000 bottles were produced. “Various experts told us that if we sell 10 000 bottles, that already would be a great start and that 30 000 bottles is a lot,” Raunio says. “Well, our best daily sales was 9 500 bottles, so the first batch was sold out pretty quickly.” Since then, the production has multiplied and Glöet has been taken to Estonia, Sweden, Norway and Luxembourg. This year, more and more markets are being tapped into, particularly German-speaking countries with their   enthusiasts. This spring, Glöet added Glöet White, a mix of cava and sangria, to its selection. Unlike the wintery version, its lighter coloured sibling is a perfect refreshment for all kinds of occasions, a bit like white wine. Glöet White is also easier to introduce to international markets, as the ingredients are much more familiar abroad than the slightly weird-sounding Finnish  . “It was also much easier to develop – the end product is recipe number nine,” Raunio notes. “When we started with Glöet, our Spanish partners weren’t sure what   was to begin with, but cava and sangria are right up their alley.” The range of colours hasn’t been exhausted yet. Currently Glöet is in the process of finalising the third bottle in the family, which will be known as Glöet Pink. Raunio won’t reveal the ingredients to the general public yet, but assures that the idea is the same as with the previous products: combining two familiar flavours in a new, surprising manner. When Glöet White is a year-round beverage, the Pink one is most likely to become a popular choice in the summer time. Glöet blends Finnish design and innovation with Spanish tradition and skills in wine making. White and Pinks are targeted a little further south than their predecessor. “Italy, Spain, Portugal and France are all potential markets,” Raunio tells. “At the moment, a lot depends on where we can find importers and partners with the right connections.” The business model lies in partnerships; aside from the owners, who run the company alongside with their day jobs, Glöet has no employees. All market openings are due to the people who have, one way or another, found the brand and believe in it. The co-founder is confident that in 2018 Glöet will see its sales figures abroad outnumber those of within the borders of Finland. Raunio has concrete evidence that there are plenty of people who do have faith in the future of low-alcohol mixed drinks. “This Christmas, a copy of our first Glöet will enter the market,” he says with a grin on his face. “You know you’ve done something right if you create something with zero prior experience in the field, and then a big business follows in your footsteps!” A bit of summer in a bottle, anyone?"

Some of the following ideas are tech-driven innovations to make it easier for you to care for your pets. Other initiatives have sought to promote animal welfare by training dogs for law enforcement and other organisations, and a biotech firm is working to stop animal diseases from spreading. Here are five ideas striving for an animal-friendlier world. With an aim to secure health and safety for animals globally, Finnish company FIT Biotech began to collaborate with Chinese Qyh Biotech Company.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/humancharger-s-breakthrough-world-stage/,HumanCharger’s breakthrough on the world stage,"These patented white-light-emitting earbuds are bound to pique the interest of anyone looking for a portable solution to winter blues or jet lag.  Although things haven’t always been easy, recent accolades indicate that there’s light at the end of the tunnel for  —and quite a lot of it, too. Earlier this year, the company was listed by the renowned global brand consultancy Interbrand as one of the world’s “ ’’. , the CEO of HumanCharger, is audibly chuffed: “It’s an amazing honour to be included in the ‘health in your hands’ category.” The world’s first portable bright light therapy device hails from Oulu, a city around 200 kilometres south of the boundary of the northern winter solstice. It’s no coincidence that HumanCharger was invented in a place where, mid-winter, you only need one hand to count the number of hours of daylight. The gadget, smaller than an iPhone 5, hosts earplugs which beam calibrated UV-free white light through the ear canals. It’s meant to be used in 12-minute ‘doses’, and around 90 per cent of users find that the product works for them. Aki Backman started off as the company’s CTO in 2013, becoming its CEO in February 2015. But there have been darker times for the young company, too. In 2012 HumanCharger found themselves scrutinised by the Finnish press, with the public questioning the scientific basis for the product. It’s a difficult subject, but Backman emphasises the increasing body of evidence supporting the gadget’s efficacy. “There’s no doubt we have enough scientific evidence on Transcranial Bright Light (TBL) to prove the efficacy of HumanCharger,” he states. Further consolation came in 2015 when HumanCharger passed TÜV SÜD’s certification processes, a German body for medical device regulation. Regulatory signals and growing international sales have eased the sting of early criticisms at home, but what’s truly kept the company going has been its customer base. “We get positive feedback almost daily which convinces us it’s worth persisting with this product,” tells Backman. Only around 10 per cent of HumanChargers are sold in Finland, where they’re manufactured. Two years ago the product started getting noticed by the biohackers in the US, who formed the first movers for HumanCharger across the Atlantic. Since then, the product has been classified as a low risk general wellness device by the FDA. What has been particularly thrilling about the US market is the level of due diligence done by individuals. “Science is all about debate, and we want our keenest consumers to take part in their own way by exercising due diligence,” Backman elaborates. “Read all the papers available, get the full picture, and try the product for yourself! We’ve always had a two-week full refund policy.” When it comes to being an advocate for the product, Backman walks the walk: “If I were to ever accidentally leave my HumanCharger at home when travelling to the US, I’d be devastated!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/valoa-makes-sure-lights-aren-t/,Valoa Design makes sure the lights aren’t out,"City lights aren’t there just for convenience and functionality; like architecture, they provide beauty and wellbeing, too. Finnish Valoa Design minds the gap between sunset and sunrise. The office of   used to be on street level in central Tampere. There was just one thing that kept disrupting the designers’ creative processes: passers-by. “People would pop in wanting to buy lamps,” CEO   says and laughs, sitting on a couch in the company’s third-floor office in the very same building. “We thought it’s best to move up a little.” Roope Siiroinen Lighting design companies like Valoa Design don’t target their services to regular consumers. Their customers are cities, buildings, construction companies and the like, wanting to add light to their architecture or infrastructure. Siiroinen, who founded Valoa Design alone in 1997, has worked in the field for over two decades. When he was a student, light design mainly took place in theatres and rock concerts. At the time, if Valoa Design offered its expertise to a company office, their response would be that ‘ ’. Now, the story is very different, and not only due to changing attitudes. “The technology has taken huge leaps forward in the past years,” Siiroinen notes. “In the ‘80s and ‘90s, light effects were used in Eurovision, and now light architecture can take advantage of similar tools. It just took about 20 years.” Evolving technology means a growing number of opportunities – as well as challenges. It’s also brought about a whole new element to Valoa Design’s work. A job used to involve three stages. First, there is an idea, which comprises the hopes and needs of the customer. Second, Valoa Design creates a concept, including technology and cost estimates. Once a plan has been confirmed, the third step is technical design. Today the work doesn’t end there, as designers have plenty more to take into account. “There was a time when a lamp was just plugged in and switched on,” Siiroinen says. “Now it’s programming: wondering what kind of lighting is needed at 6 pm on a Friday and at 5 am on a Monday, differences between weeks, months and seasons, foggy mornings and festival weekends…” Valoa Design’s home town Tampere and Jyväskylä have both used the company’s expertise in their cityscapes, both having won international awards for their efforts. Siiroinen believes that Nordic design is hot stuff in light design, too. “Simple is beautiful. We don’t do Las Vegas style with blinking and lasers.” Less is more. Pikisaari Bridge represents Nordic design with its simple beauty. This year it won the Lighting Design Award. As one of the first players in the field, Valoa Design has collected various awards and references that have led to further projects. Despite this, there’s no room for lukewarm performances. “You’re only as good as you’re most recent piece of work,” Siiroinen points out. Hence the company is currently focusing on Finland. Previously it has completed projects in China, Estonia, Eastern Europe and Russia and even had an office in Austria. At some point, the world will call again. Valoa Design has harnessed an abundance of experience in creating masterplans for large entities, which could enable it to take up a consultative role in the international markets. “Being able to adjust lighting to changing circumstances adds to the importance of cities’ strategies: what is needed, where, when and why?” Siiroinen explains. “As we’re not just a lighting operator, we’re expected to deliver something more remarkable than plain functionality.” Valoa Design doesn’t have a marketing or sales department. Thus far its reputation has been enough to keep up the growth. “Someone’s referred to our marketing as ‘aggressive waiting’,” Siiroinen says and smiles. “In order to boost our marketing, we’d need more resources to be able to accept more and more projects. To have a sales team, we’ll need more designers.” Coincidentally, advertising and marketing are also fields in which Siiroines sees enormous potential for light design companies in the future. “We no longer talk about lamps, but signals, communications and the ways in which we experience our environments. It’s a whole psychological entirety.” “The facade, environment and interior lighting creates an ambitious entirety,” Siiroinen says about Wuxi Grand Theatre in China. “The facade changes its look from sophisticated white light to dynamic show light.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/inventshift-story-young-social-enterprise/,Inventshift: the story of a young social enterprise,"After completing Aaltoes’ Kiuas accelerator programme and winning the Crowd Favourite Award, the future is looking crowded for this startup duo. Nestled within Aalto University’s red brick blocks is  , a co-working space which was one of the many factors that brought Finn   and Sri Lankan   to Helsinki from Melbourne. That, and the buzzing startup scene. “We’d been living in Melbourne for three years and were running a mobile coffee chain,  , which was our first business together,” tells Gomes. “We’re bootstrapping it to kickstart   and its younger sibling,  .” The meeting room we’re in hosts a black table hanging on rope, creating the illusion it could take off mid-sway. Not unlike the duo’s future prospects, it seems. But, back to the backstory for a moment. “We were travelling in the Australian countryside the summer before last when we came across some bare land that looked very desolate.” Gomes continues, “We thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to do something more with this?’ Jarkko’s friend is an environmental ecologist, he could make magic happen here.’” This sparked the idea of creating a framework that would help other people accomplish big things through social enterprise, “because we can’t do everything ourselves”. The roots of Inventshift and ServiceHired also lie in the hands-on experience of the duo as business owners. They found their mobile coffee chain was constantly being sent the same types of enquiries, with them pinging back the same routine responses. “We wanted to streamline that so that businesses can sell pre-priced packages online without the repetitious back and forth,” Jarkko summarises. The first iteration of ServiceHired had 3 000 businesses sign up to it around the world, and 200 buying customers. Inventshift was the first website born out of this idea: it was both an online learning platform for social enterprises from all around the world, and a way to buy ‘packages’ from local services. But this melded both service-buying and social enterprise-promoting onto one site, which some customers found confusing. Fast-forward to local services getting their own space called Servicehired: a search and booking engine for local services which will launch towards the end of the year. “This’ll be our business arm,” Gomes explains. “You can search for services, filter your price, find your photographer, florist or any other service category of choice and buy a pre-priced package from them then and there.” She then reveals the extent of their global ambitions. “It’s kind of like Booking.com for hotels or Momondo for flights, only this would be for local services”. Inventshift will then be left to perform the sole function of being a beacon for social enterprises, educating people about them, while representing the education charities ServiceHired will donate to. If you need proof that the   of ServiceHired is InventShift, here’s all you need: 10 per cent of Servicehired’s revenue will go to charities represented by the latter. What’s noteworthy here is that charitable proceeds will be taken out of revenues, not profits. “Some investors are confused by this – but it’s for transparency and to put the customer first” says Gomes. According to Oksanen this is just better from a customer’s point of view. “if you buy something for 1 000 euros, you know that out of the 15 per cent commission, 10 per cent of that will go to charity, so that’s around 15 euros.” ServiceHired.com is set to launch at some point after Slush: “We’re post-revenue, having launched one version of the product,” Oksanen explains. “Getting selected for Slush 2017’s Demo Booth means we’re pushing back launch of the second version.” But will they remain in Finland for long? Gomes, at least, seems keen: “There are so many pretty Christmas trees here!” The heads of Aaltoes’ Kiuas accelerator programme (l to r: Antti Hämmäinen, Vilma Viiala and Karri Koskikare) hand out the crowd favourite award to Oksanen and Gomes."

From street food to fine dining, a blossoming culinary scene in Finland has encouraged an assortment of new dining concepts and a vibrant gastronomic culture across the country. Many restaurants and accomplished chefs have braved culinary variety beyond the traditional Finnish palate, invigorated by Nordic devotion to freshness and imagination. The success of Finnish dining concepts has been warmly welcomed across the globe. Here are five Finnish places to wine and dine when you are abroad. In freshly baked buns, meat ground on site and triple cooked fries lies the secrets to great burgers. The concept of this restaurant has caught on quickly, and the burger chain has already opened its doors in Denmark. A second international shop has just opened in Hamburg, Germany. “We look forward to coming to Germany, and think that there’s a demand for a a concept like ours,” said  , responsible for the restaurants’ new locations,  . The Michelin guide has highlighted this restaurant with the Bib Gourmand marking, which awards its exceptionally good food at a moderate price. The modern Asian restaurant aims to combine a fresh palate with a modern ambiance. , owner and operator of Farang in Helsinki   described the restaurant as “a concept that is strong enough to be taken anywhere.” “Obviously there are plenty of interesting cities: London, New York, Sydney. Right now they are ideas, but everything else has started just from ideas.” Considering itself as a participant in a changing nutritional culture, this reggstaurant describes itself as delicious, smart and responsible. The reggstaurant selects its eggs from chickens that roam free all year round, and it has developed a vegan version of scrambled eggs. Its first international location will be launched in co-operation with Forenom Aparthotel in Stockholm. “Putting two things together is a win-win for [Forenom and EGG],” co-founder    . “Why does an opera house need to have a terrible restaurant, when there could be an excellent one – and that would introduce opera fans to food and food lovers to opera?” Four times a year, tax and other regulatory authorities make an exception regarding regulations concerning the restaurant industry. During such days, anyone can open their dream pop-up restaurant in a park, street corner, at the office or at home. According to the  , “During the first five years of quarterly global food carnivals all together over 27 000 pop-up restaurants by over 100 000 restaurateurs have catered for over three million customers in 75 countries.” You will recognise this Finnish fast-food chain anywhere in the world by its staple white cucumber mayonnaise and fresh ingredients. The inventor of the mayonnaise in question sold five double-deckers on the opening night in 1972, and from that day Hesburger’s concept has grown and spread across Finland and to global markets. For example,  ,   and   all have their share of the burger. “Belarusians travel a lot in the Baltic countries, and whilst travelling they’ve got to know Hesburger’s products,” said  , Hesburger’s international development and marketing director  . “The next logical step for was to move on to the Belarusian market.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/shaman-spirits-shoots-for-the-stars/,Shaman Spirits shoots for the stars,"This factory-size boutique distillery owns some of the most exciting brands breaking through on the luxury alcohol scene.  Finland’s boutique distilleries really did start from the bottom. Independence in 1917 brought with it an era of prohibition which lasted 15 years, swiftly followed by 60 years of state control of the alcohol industry. Distilleries were only granted permission to operate in 1995, when the country joined the EU. But  ’ ‘spiritual journey’ began way before this in 1860, when a local potato farmer in Northern Finland’s Tyrnävä in today’s province of Oulu received a distillation permit from the Tsar of Russia, allowing him to cook spirits in 23-litre batches. Little did that farmer,  , know that he was cooking up his spirits on top of some of the best quality groundwater on Earth. Later, his descendent   had an inkling his ancestor was onto something great and started getting the ball rolling for Shaman Spirits. But there’s another origin story of Shaman Spirits too: a pub and nightclub called the Shaman in Kuopio. New flavours of Shaman Spirits’ bestselling brand Laplandia vodka were launched in August, with each bottle containing 550 grams of real wild berries. “When we sold the club to launch this venture in 1998, we realised we should keep the name with the double entendre,”  , CEO and partner, recalls. Fast-forward to today and Shaman Spirits is climbing to glory, having received a slew of international awards over the past decade (28 in total) and recently announcing collaborations with London’s NOBU restaurant and the Singapore Grand Prix. A key ingredient to the rocketship’s fuel is unsurprisingly also the key ingredient of the drink they make – water. Sulkala explains: “The UN rates Finland’s drinking water among the best in the world, and our water in Tyrnävä is particularly clean even by Finnish standards. Hence one could argue our vodka is made from one of the cleanest water sources in the whole world.” Indeed their groundwater runs through an esker, holding hints of the glacial sands it has passed through, and is clean enough not to need post-processing before distillation. It was this groundwater, as well as the fact that Shaman Spirits runs one of only two factory-size distilleries in Finland, which caught the eye of Global Drinks Finland. They owned the rights to  ,   – the only vodka that is kosher all year round – and  . “We’d been producing their brands for a while when we realised we wanted to deepen the relationship and get married,” says Sulkala. The merger has helped Shaman Spirits go global, with Laplandia Vodka already being exported to 16 countries, and ongoing negotiations hoping to increase that right up to 30. Collaborating with Singapore’s GP marked the opening up of Asian markets. Judging by how things are going, they’re a match made in heaven. “2016 saw a turnover of 1.1 million euros, 2017 will be around two million, and 2018 is projected at four million euros.” All in the name of affordable luxury. What’s more, the household wishes to treat their global guests well, as is showcased in the Laplandia Vodka app which launched last year. Sulkala concludes: “Given the rich balance of flavours already there in the vodka, you don’t need a lot to impress.” Ilpo Sulkala, CEO and partner, has been with the company since 1998, which at first survived off two products: a Salmari liquor of vodka and salty liquorice and a pine extract liquor called Terva."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/psyon-games-makes-science-great/,Psyon Games makes science great again,"Finnish Psyon Games gained worldwide fame with its Trump vs. Science game. Next, it’s set out to sway those who don’t believe in vaccinations. White blood cells battling against an infection, a virus trying to shake the immune system – armed with faces, arms and legs. For Finnish ’90s kids, this sounds familiar from a TV show known as  . The series turned cells, organs and other body parts into characters that were fighting to keep their human healthy. Almost by accident, viewers learned a great deal about biology, such as defence mechanisms and bodily functions. CEO Olli Rundgren That’s exactly what   founder and CEO   has in mind: learning by entertainment. “Games are superior to any other form of advertising because of their high level of engagement,” he explains. “If they’re used to educate and inform people, the impact can be huge.” Making an impact requires catching the attention of the ever-so-busy modern people. It might be difficult, but Psyon Games knows it’s well within the realm of possibility: the studio did exactly that with  . The simple game splashes out tweets by  , the now President of the United States, from when the election campaign was still running. Players can then throw the scientifically inaccurate tweets down with science books. The concept was covered by global mass media, including  ,   and  . “The most anti-science nominee ever was running for the most powerful position in the world,” Rundgren says. “We wanted people to realise his claims stemmed out of an ideology and weren’t in line with unbiased scientific facts.” The next scientific battlefield Psyon Games is about to step into is the world of vaccinations and antibiotics. Rundgren points out that misinformation about medicine has a dire effect on some communities and particularly individual children.  , antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development. To tackle false claims, Psyon Games has created a science entertainment game called  . Similarly to  ,   renders complex biological processes comprehensible by making them entertaining. Even the   has thanked the game for its combination of fun, digitalisation and educational work. Antidote talks about vaccinations and antibiotics in a comprehensible way. Currently the studio is negotiating with multinational pharmaceutical companies to find powerful partners for its mission. Although both Psyon Games and its future collaborators do have financial interests involved, Rundgren emphasises that everything is operated science first. “Of course pharmaceutical firms benefit if their products are bought,” he says. “But for as long as what we’re selling is backed by the vast majority of the world’s scientific community, it also benefits the general public. It’s just a new channel for conveying information.”  has been test launched in various countries, and its global launch awaits on 13 November – which also happens to be the first day of this year’s World Antibiotic Awareness Week. The game’s goal is to reach out to people who don’t necessarily understand scientific jargon – and not only parents, but young folks, too. “Today’s youth will one day be parents themselves. We want to help them make informed decisions about their own and their children’s health.” It’s no accident Rundgren’s pet project is a game. He’s always loved games, and actually collected the capital for starting two companies through gaming: he used to be a professional poker player. However, he also studied science enthusiastically, particularly chemistry, physics and biology. Once, he happened to hear Finnish gaming guru  ’s speech about the future of gaming and learning. “It was so inspiring I instantly jumped into game development and started building a team.” A lot of time and money has passed since. Rundgren admits laughingly that his savings might be gone, but the journey has been well worth it. “Right now I’m doing exactly what I want to do with people who share the same passion,” he notes. “Building a company is like a strategic puzzle: everything needs to fit in place to make it whole.” Last year, Trump vs. Science became a global hit."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/flashnode-integrates-business-applications/,Flashnode integrates business applications,"This Finnish company specialises in making a company’s different systems work in harmony. It’s a dream come true. You’ve finally opened that bookstore you have always wanted. You buy inventory and invest in all the systems you need. Then, the nightmare begins. Your accounting software doesn’t work with your logistics system, which in turn doesn’t match with your webstore. The inability of different systems to work together is a depressingly common occurrence, but now an innovative new integration solution has been developed by Finnish company  . “The unfortunate fact is that most SMEs still do a lot of manual work, copy-pasting customer and order information from their webshop to their accounting, for example,” says  , cofounder and chief sales and marketing officer of Flashnode. Flashnode integrates common business applications, such as e-commerce, accounting, logistics, payments and customer relationship management. Just like all the parts of an F1 car need to work together in harmony to win a Grand Prix, business systems need to work together in order for the company to succeed. A number of years ago the cofounders realised that they regularly faced the same challenges when working on integration projects, with the same schedules, complexity and development from scratch. There was a clear business case to make integrations easier and more affordable. “The MVP (minimum viable product) of our integration platform worked really well and even we were surprised by how much faster and more efficient it was to build the integrations,” Räsänen continues. “The decision was quite easy: full steam ahead!” Customers don’t need any technical skills and we even help them to figure out how the automation should work in order to get the maximum out of it. After developing the first generation of the platform and working with customers, they began to expand their offering and continued improving their solutions. Today they have everything from simple integration systems for popular applications to bespoke solutions. “The current generation of the platform allows us to customise the integrations and has opened the market for bigger customers with customised systems as well,” says Räsänen. “Now we can serve customers from small micro-companies to middle-sized enterprises.” The simple reason for Flashnode’s solutions is to improve efficiency: by automating integration, their clients free up wasted time. Räsänen says that some clients can save over 15 000 euros annually. “We really help our customers to get their processes right,” Räsänen explains. “Especially when it comes to accounting integrations, the themes are very complex and best practices are not clear for the customers. We know the systems of our partners well and how they are used – what actually happens when data is pushed in. Customers don’t need any technical skills and we even help them to figure out how the automation should work in order to get the maximum out of it.” Currently most of the company’s customers are from the UK and Finland, but it is already eyeing a global expansion. Flashnode is not just looking for new clients, but also for new partners. “We’re looking for other companies to join forces with,” says cofounder and CEO  . “It’s always good to work together with other companies with the same goals. These companies could be software companies joining our ecosystem of compatible software or companies just expanding to new markets.” Flashnode is growing rapidly, with now over 30 supported applications and 12 employees in three offices across Europe. “The next step for our company is to conquer new markets,” Keinänen says. “The biggest single market is the US, definitely one of our target regions quite soon. Starting new markets requires a lot of effort, but that’s still our plan.”"

The sky is the limit for the founders selected to participate in this bracing competition. Startup event Slush kicked off the world’s first skydive pitching competition in September. Founders jump from the airborne “Nerd Bird”, and answer questions from investors while falling at approximately 120 miles per hour. “This year there are 100 seats on the Slush Flight and we wanted to secure seats for some of the boldest founders,”   Slush’s  . “And how to do this?

In Finland, some of the alternatives are of local produce. Food is life! In the case of vegetarians and vegans even more so, as even the UN has encouraged global reduction in meat consumption to help save the planet as well as improve people’s health. One aspect not to be forgotten is animal welfare, too. These Finnish companies are doing their fair share to help people fill their plates with veggie options rather than animals. Traditional Japanese tofu gets contemporary forms in the hands of Jalotofu experts in Tammisaari.  , commercial director at Jalofoods, doesn’t see the company working towards replacing or eradicating meat; rather, the aim is add to the alternatives that enable people to make their diets healthier and more sustainable. “People are increasingly aware of the effects of food production on both their health and the environment,”  . “The fact is that the biggest increase in sales doesn’t come from full-on vegans and vegetarians as such, but from people who choose to reduce their meat consumption and opt for plant-based alternatives more often than they used to.” Protein- and fibre-packed, soy- and gluten-free   made from Finnish-grown fava beans is a household name in Finland. Now, its producer Verso Food is heading abroad under the name Fava Mill, first in Sweden and Norway and later in continental Europe and the UK.

Rather, she calls them partners. “The market is still so small I think that if anything, we’re supporting each other,”  . “The more alternatives there are, the more people deem them worthy for their plates, too.” Pulled oats made Finland go berserk for its flavour: in-store trials sold out in a few hours and production was rapidly ramped up for widespread release in the country. Last year, food company Paulig acquired the majority ownership of the manufacturer Gold&Green Foods. The company has its eyes on the global markets. “To put it really simply, you could say that we have invented a new soy,”   from Gold&Green Foods  . “It’s a perfect protein based on Nordic ingredients.” Starting from pressing juice from fresh fruit and vegetables at the back of founder  ‘s garage, the company then went on to develop of a brand new product of their own, the probiotic oat-based Yosa.

Vegans can have a sweet tooth, too, which was taken into consideration at Makulaku. According to export director  , offering organic and vegan filled liquorice hits two growing global trends. To Alanen’s knowledge, Makulaku is the only brand that produces filled liquorice that satisfies the cravings of all persuasions. “At the moment, about half of all production is exported, but the percentage is growing,”  . “There is plenty of potential in the international market, and we’re constantly looking for new distributors.”"

This is about to change.  Educational technology (edtech) is a huge global market with new apps, games and services launching daily. But for teachers and parents looking for engaging and effective learning tools, it can feel like entering a Wild West of choice. Up until now, there has been no quick way to separate the gems from the rocks.  believes it has a solution. The digital education startup has created a quality verification service for exactly this market based on Finnish educational expertise. “All of we four founders have worked in education and two of us are former teachers,” explains  , founder and CEO of Kokoa. “We know how difficult it is to find the products that effectively support learning. What we have developed is a methodology for evaluating the pedagogical quality of digital learning products.” How the service works is straightforward. A company submits their learning app for evaluation and it is compared against a long list of learning science principles. The assessment covers learning goals and outcomes, engagement and pedagogical approach. In the end the company receives detailed feedback on the product and, if successful, is awarded the ‘Kokoa Education Standard’ certificate. The idea for Kokoa was sparked by a single email. In early 2015, Kukkasniemi had just left  ’ creator Rovio (where she was part of its educational team) when she was contacted by a Saudi-Arabian gaming studio. The company needed help with content development for its educational games. Over half of our new customers come from abroad, in particular Hong Kong, the UK and US. Kukkasniemi partnered with two other ex-Rovio colleagues for the project and realised there were plenty of other edtech companies in need of similar assistance. Kokoa was born. “We started as a design company, but a lot of companies wanted to know how their products should work to make learning more effective,” Kukkasniemi recalls. “And also, what Finns see as a good learning app. Finnish teaching is valued very highly internationally. We started to develop the verification service and now it is our main focus.” The service appeals to multiple types of edtech companies. Some see an independent certification as a marketing tool, while others want Kokoa’s feedback during their product development so they can make adjustments early. “A lot of our customers target schools or parents, but our methodology can be used for any kinds of learning products,” Kukkasniemi says. “For example, we are currently assessing a learning tool for B2B sales. The criteria whether a product supports efficient learning is very similar no matter if the target group is children or adult learners.” The criteria may be the same for everybody, but the bar for passing Kokoa’s assessment is set high. Only about half of submitted products receive a certificate. This strict process is bearing fruit as Kokoa’s standard is increasingly recognised. “It has been great to witness our reputation grow,” Kukkasniemi enthuses. “Over half of our new customers come from abroad, in particular Hong Kong, the UK and US.” Kokoa already has its first sales partner in Hong Kong, but the next big thing for the seven-person strong company is to publish its own online marketplace. This will enable customers to find and compare all Kokoa certified products in one place and will be unveiled at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki in November. “We hope it will become the go to place for educators and parents looking to find the best digital learning products,” Kukkasniemi says. “We want people to see our stamp on a product and know they can trust it is high quality.” Kokoa’s quality verification method is based on pedagogical research regarding how we learn. All evaluations are done by Finnish teachers and digital education specialists."

Whim is already gaining traction, but to understand the true potential of the service, and to appreciate the full ambition of MaaS Global, you have to go deeper and consider the model that underlies the app. The company calls it “Mobility as a Service” (MaaS), and it is convinced that it will fundamentally change the way we get around. , CEO of MaaS Global and a long-time champion of “Mobility as a Service”, compares the concept of MaaS to mobile operators: just as you buy a subscription from an operator to access their mobile telephone network, you can buy a travel package from a MaaS operator to access transportation providers’ services. What permits this is an ecosystem of transport industry players who offer their solutions through a shared platform. Built on open application programming interfaces (APIs), this ecosystem will connect the different companies in the industry, allowing the users of a MaaS-based app such as Whim to access the services of participating transportation providers. This may sound complicated, but how it works in practice is straightforward: all the client needs to do is specify where they want to go, and the app checks what travel options are available and proposes the most convenient ones. And for a monthly fee, the client can use the various modes of transportation included in the app. As the ecosystem grows and more companies join, the service will be able to take care of most if not all of its users’ transportation needs, ranging from the daily commute to weekend getaways.  “Finnish technical expertise has a good reputation abroad, and Finnish companies are generally seen as reliable,” says MaaS Global CEO Sampo Hietanen. If this sounds fanciful, Hietanen would counter by pointing out that many research centres expect the MaaS industry to skyrocket and be worth up to a trillion euros by 2030. Moreover, MaaS Global has seen intense interest in the concept from the international press: the  ,  , the   and   have written about the company, hailing its service a promising form of future transit. It might be slightly surprising that a major transport industry disruption is being constructed in Finland, when the best-known players – companies such as Google (self-driving cars), Tesla (electric cars) and Uber (ride-sharing) – tend to be based in the US. But Hietanen says that Helsinki has been a great home base for the company. “Finnish technical expertise has a good reputation abroad, and Finnish companies are generally seen as reliable,” he says. “And it may be surprising, coming from a start-up CEO, but Finland is also a great place in terms of regulations: politicians and government officials have been very supportive.” But going abroad is unavoidable when aiming to establish yourself as a major transport player on a global scale. “For us, Helsinki is really a test laboratory. We have to expand, and fast, to prove ourselves.” The company will therefore take Whim to 10 new locations around the world, with the service opening in Birmingham, Antwerp and Amsterdam first. If things take off the way the company hopes, the service will even have noticeable effects on the cityscape. “I expect that in five years, this form of travel has become much more common, and more people will opt out of owning a car,” Hietanen says. “There will be less space needed for parking and more space available for living in the cities.” We are of course only at the infancy of the new industry. But if MaaS continues to grow, services based on it have huge potential, given the gigantic size of the mobility market. MaaS Global’s ambitious goal is to establish itself as a major player in the growing sector, Hietanen says. “The road may be long, but the industry is on track to become massive, and someone will end up benefitting greatly. I don’t see why it couldn’t be us.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/buying-something-abroad-thank-xmldation/,Buying something abroad? Thank XMLdation,"This Finnish company acts as a bridge between startup fintechs and established banks, making sure our modern payment system works as advertised. It all seems so easy that we rarely give it a second thought. We can buy something from an Italian online store or sell something to Germany as easily as doing business with the shop down the street. In reality, it has taken a great deal of effort to build the modern financial payment system so that money flows seamlessly between banks and businesses in Europe. One Finnish company,  , is busy in the background, making sure our money safely and quickly gets to where it is supposed to go. “XMLdation was founded in 2009,” says CEO  . “The founders had in-depth experience with corporate cash management and payments, and they realised that there was going to be a change in the way corporates send and receive payments because of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).” “XML”, in case you were wondering, stands for Extensible Markup Language, which defines rules to encode documents which are readable for both humans and machines. The “d” stands for “document” and “-ation” comes from “validation”. SEPA, meanwhile, is a payment-integration scheme for the simplification of bank transfers in the euro area. It has grown in scope over time, as has XMLdation. The company initially offered a tool for developers working with back office systems to test payment files corporations send to banks. Later they created a bank simulation capability so developers could test received payments. We are unique as we sit between the startup fintech space and the established banks, and our product makes their integration easier. “Currently, we’re the leading specialist in the field of Open Banking Test Sandboxes,” Leppälahti continues. “We provide Software-as-a-Service for banks and other financial institutions who need to onboard and offer test portals for developers looking to connect to bank APIs.” Leppälahti explains this is important because of the Payments Services Directive 2, which forces banks to open up their data and services to other companies, such as fintechs. The idea is to encourage new players in the market and support the development of innovative payment services. “This will boost competition and, of course, hopefully increase the need for our kind of product as well,” he says. “In addition, what’s exciting for us specifically is that North America is finally also reengineering their payment infrastructure. Canada, for example, has already decided to introduce real-time payments. The United States is going to follow a similar path in the future.” The company’s expertise in helping payment service providers in Europe with SEPA payments will now become relevant in North America. Thanks to the increasing interest in their products they are in the process of expanding their presence in that area. XMLdation has 15 people in Finland and Ireland and is currently hiring staff in the UK and Germany. They are particularly strong in the Nordic market and already count most of the large banks in the region as customers, such as Nordea, DN, Danske and OP. They also have clients in the UK, Ireland, France, Italy and German-speaking Europe. In addition to banks, they have helped payment service providers, clearing houses and banking vendors. Their solutions fall into four main categories: corporate support and onboarding, fintech developer support, supporting payment test scenarios and payment ecosystem content. To the average consumer, it is invisible as they just know they can quickly and safely make international payments, but XMLdation works hard in the background with banks and businesses to make sure our modern financial system works as promised. “We are unique as we sit between the startup fintech space and the established banks, and our product makes their integration easier,” Leppälahti says. With CEO Jarkko Leppälahti at the helm, the company’s expertise in helping payment service providers in Europe with SEPA payments is set to become relevant in North America."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-location-tracking-innovations/,Five for Friday: Location tracking innovations,"This quintet is putting Finnish location technologies on the map.   Keeping track doesn’t mean keeping on the beaten track – innovative location technologies have developed to enhance navigation and tracking systems for shopping, sports and healthcare to name but a few. Location-based information can be oriented in an abundance of ways to enhance user and customer experience. That said, are you looking for a firm with a good track record of recording a track? Winner of the Elisa IoT innovation challenge at Slush in 2016, Emergence can be considered an emerging expert in IoT technology. The firm has developed taival, a location-tracking device powered by solar energy and connected to the cloud which facilitates asset management and logistical efficiency. “We are eager to expand and grow fast,”  . “We are aiming to be a major player in the worldwide business for wireless positioning services.” Blurring the boundaries between the physical world and the domain of apps is the focus of this firms’ indoor navigation system. Proximi.io supports a navigation platform that allows users to add location-based positioning, geofencing and triggering and includes all available positioning technologies through one API. “There have been a lot of new indoor navigation technologies popping up, but the field is also really confusing,”  , “We make it really easy and simple for developers who want to use location awareness on their apps.” The possibility to shop on the web has changed customer behaviour – but only to some extent. Walkbase analytics collects data on customer behaviour to show how to optimise store layouts, customer service, merchandising, and staff rotas. The objective is to optimize the in-store shopping experience by developing the wow effect and customising the client experience. “There are many categories where you want to have the physical experience: a conversation with somebody, or touch and feel the products immediately,”  . From players on a sports pitch to customers in a shop, this intelligent tracking technology allows for real-time tracking smart tags and devices with high accuracy. So far, it has seen success in enhancing user involvement in industries such as healthcare, sports, security, and logistics. “Sports is definitely a hot one for us, simply because it’s fun. You also have the quickest speed of execution,”  , “It’s a tough environment – if you do it in sport, you can do it in retail.” Three former Nokia colleagues have united to tailor mobile targeting technologies combining marketing potential, timing, and personalisation. Central to their idea is a location-based targeting which can, for example, notify you about an umbrella sale close to you when it begins to rain. “We have platforms which we white label for our customers. With these they can target their content, be it advertising, news or emergency messages. (The clientele) is targeted based on their preferences, interests, location and time,”  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gigglebug-s-laughter-is-a-global-epidemic/,Gigglebug’s laughter is a global epidemic,"Gigglebug Entertainment’s mission to bring laughter to the world has led to a global animation success and collaboration with Disney. It all started with a tickle.  “Could we infect laugher through a cartoon character the way laughter is contagious between people?” was the question posed to   four years ago. His colleague   wanted to make an app where tickling a grumpy bear would make it laugh. Little did they know where this seemingly silly idea would lead. “The idea of contagious laughter was so simple and profound at the same time, we wanted to explore it further,” says Harlin, today CEO and producer at  . “People are at their happiest when they laugh. If we can give that to kids through a cartoon and the characters we create, it is a great mission: spreading happiness.” The first demo app was a success. Harlin and Utti’s friends were laughing in stitches and the duo started building a story around the idea. They wanted to make the central character relatable to children who are the smallest in a group and so the Gigglebug, the smallest creature in the forest was born. First its adventures (which always end in irresistible laughter) were told via apps, then through an animated TV series and today almost everywhere. The   TV series has been streamed over two million times in Finland alone (population 5.5 million) and its rights sold to 13 countries. The Gigglebug apps have topped the charts in 64 countries and the brand has been successfully expanded to music albums, live events and soon, picture books. “With Gigglebug we have achieved something no-one has done before,” says Anttu Harlin (left, pictured with co-founder Joonas Utti). “It is the biggest animated kids’ series ever made in Finland.” Although the success of   took Harlin and Utti by surprise, behind it is over a decade of experience in developing characters for children’s shows. Their focus on storytelling, character-building and creating worlds with universally touching themes soon caught Disney’s eye. “They took me out for dinner two years ago to ask if we would be open to working on something together,” Harlin recalls. “I was like, ‘Wow, I didn’t expect that.” They liked Gigglebug’s distinct look, clear graphic style and strong characters that have heart and humour and wanted us to use this approach to develop characters for something they own.” That something was  . The duo was given practically free hands to create their own take on the classic, which was then used to develop a new series around the original brand. Disney recently greenlit the series and it will be broadcast in a few years’ time. Harlin says while the Disney collaboration is ongoing, Gigglebug Entertainment’s team of 15 people has its hand full developing four new brands and expanding the world of Gigglebug. The company’s latest launch is an animated TV series and an interactive game called  . The show goes into production next year and, in true Gigglebug style, it has more layers than it first might seem. “It’s set in a world where everybody gets to choose what they want to be and these two buddies keep comparing what is the best thing of all time,” Harlin describes. “It’s a really wacky comedy that celebrates freedom of choice and opinion.” Harlin adds there is a lot of interest in Nordic values and their unique point-of-view in children’s entertainment, but feels it is still largely underused. He wants to use the Nordic voice as fuel for long-lasting global brands and businesses. In future, this could mean setting up a full-blown animation studio in Helsinki, but only if it serves Gigglebug Entertainment’s larger mission: “I want us have positive impact. One the biggest things we can give to the world is making it a better place through positivity,” Harlin concludes. It seems there is no limit to what the smallest creature in the forest can achieve."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/time-essence-ronkko/,Time is of the essence for Rönkkö,"This esteemed Finnish watch brand is silently making an impact around the world. The Finnish startup scene is peppered with companies that have been founded after their team members parted ways with Nokia. Given the fluctuating fortunes of the company, many have had their hand forced by circumstance. Yet for  , he made the decision to leave the Finnish stalwart once he sold his first watch. “I worked for years at Nokia Research Center in fine mechanics before setting up my own watch brand in 2012,” he recalls. “I have loved mechanical watches since I was a small kid and becoming an independent watchmaker was natural; it had always been my dream.” Using his surname as a moniker, his independent watchmaking company   has since carved a name for itself by making fine handmade mechanical timepieces in limited editions for a cosmopolitan clientele. “I aim for perfection in my timepieces,” Rönkkö says. “Handmade timepieces are like art. They get bought and collected for the same reasons: design, aesthetics, perfection in craftsmanship and visual pleasure.” Since 2012, Rönkkö has launched five different timepieces with different complications, drawing inspiration from mythology to sculpt each aesthetic. Aside from this, the obvious overriding theme of the watches is time, both in their function and the hours which go into each piece. When I wind a finished timepiece for the first time and watch it animating, I know it will be ticking for over 100 years with proper maintenance. “Delivery times of my timepieces are from six months to two years,” Rönkkö says. “Unlike many tech startups I have only two hands.” The other important ingredient is silence. According to Rönkkö, peace and quiet is the first condition of horologic art. All insight, design, art and innovation are born in silence. Realisation occurs when one takes a break from thinking. “Silence comes naturally for a Finn, when you have months of darkness you have to deal with,” he states. “For a Finn, silence means time for thought; creating something out of nothing. It’s what happens at my bench.” In contrast, international acclaim has been turning up the volume. Rönkkö’s handmade watches have been selected twice in the row by the international publication of Lürzer’s Archive, which presents the best creative design from over 70 different countries every year. This recent acclaim has widened the scope for his work, with customers now travelling long distances to meet their makers. “My clients come to my workshop to collect their timepieces when they are ready,” Rönkkö says. “They want to get to know their timepiece in depth… and of course have a good chat. My clientele is culturally mixed, made up of interesting individuals from all over the world: the US, Mediterranean, Far East, Asia, Europe and Finland, of course.” Now, with his global customer base continuing to grow, Rönkkö remains in no hurry to expand operations, preferring to maintain his hands-on approach. The most important thing for him is the quality of the final product, now and in the future. “I will continue to transform ancient legends into mythical handmade timepieces,” Rönkkö says. “I will sit at my bench for the next year, think about nothing and suddenly the next timepiece is ready in front of my eyes.” Independent watchmaker Antti Rönkkö makes ultra-limited edition wristwatches by hand in his workshop in Espoo, Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/stairforce-takes-it-one-successful-step-at-a-time/,Stairforce takes it one successful step at a time,"Next time you are about to step into an elevator, this Finnish company would like you to consider taking the stairs to the stars. The Sydney Opera House is known for many things: ingenuity of design, being a symbol of modern Australia and a venue for many of the world’s greatest performers. In addition to these, the iconic building now represents another symbol of achievement: it stands at 65 metres tall, the exact elevation I have climbed in total over the past 48 hours since activating Finnish app   on my phone. In fact, my upward trajectory has already surpassed the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa (56 metres) and the Statue of Liberty (46 metres), to name but a few of the motivational icons on my phone. “Our goal is to hoax a person to become healthier with clever service design,” states Stairforce co-creator  . “We already have enough gauges and heart rate monitors etc.” This surely is welcome news for a global community that is increasingly becoming dormant in a digitalised world, as technology facilitates greater ease of, well, pretty much everything. “Choosing the stairs instead of the elevator is the easiest thing that you can do for your health,” Leppänen says. “While the health benefits of exercise, in general, are nothing new, renewed attention is being paid to the effect that exercise during the workday has on an individual’s output.” Although Stairforce has only recently been soft launched, the idea itself has been brewing for considerably longer. “You don’t need to keep the app open at all times for it to work,” Leppänen says. “Altitude data is collected even when the phone’s screen is locked.” “Three years ago, I was climbing the stairs at work and I visualised myself climbing a stairway into space,” Leppänen recalls. “This struck me as a cool way to encourage people to dodge elevators. At the same time, I was reading books about making habits and thinking about how redesigning habits could nudge people towards healthier choices.” The idea quickly took shape, fuelled by the fact that stair climbing burns more calories per minute than jogging. Service design company Palmu funded the development of the app and the five-person team built its first prototype and tested on users. The past nine months have seen a big push to develop and launch the app – all the while with a marketing budget that is close to zero. “We are now at the beginning,” Leppänen observes. “We are trying to find our tribe and understand what users want. Our main channel to connect with and listen to our users is Instagram.” Another social media tool being harnessed is Facebook, through which users can connect and compete with one another on their race to the top. The company is making some final tweaks to the concept for the remainder of the year, after which Leppänen points to an international horizon. “In 2018, it is time to roll out the app to more markets,” he foresees. “Now we are looking for funding, but more than this we are interested in partners. We could join forces with a player in the healthcare sector or an app/game company.” Leppänen enthuses about a future when apps such as Stairforce could be prescribed by doctors to treat certain ailments. But for the time being, Stairforce is continuing its path to the stars. Yet for all of the talk about upward motion, one wonders what happens to users when the tables are turned and staircases are descended. “Many people have asked this, but Stairforce doesn’t have a Hell,” Leppänen says with a laugh. One final thought comes to mind, as the interview draws to a close: for all the talk of being pioneers with monitoring stair climbing, isn’t this already possible via Fitbit? Leppänen smiles. “Fitbit can count stairs, yes, but we have gamified it.” Alongside regular users, Stairforce has also been growing in popularity among elite tower runners."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-beauty-health-nature/,Five for Friday: Beauty and health from nature,"Beauty may be only skin deep, but the Finnish connection with nature has even deeper roots. What better way to put your face on or hydrate your skin than by using natural ingredients in deliciously fresh, nature-inspired forms? These innovative solutions harness and transform the splendour of Finnish woods and tasty flavours of forest berries into healthy cosmetic products. These five companies are here to make you feel fresh as a wild Finnish cloudberry – and are ready to be globally applied. Cooperating with the Technical Reseach Center of Finland (VTT), Lumene was the first in the world to launch Arctic cloudberry stem cell technology. Lumene also began a WaterSmart programme to reduce their water footprint and by-products from other industries are used to minimise waste, with a philosophy of transmitting the Arctic glow to its customers in a responsible way. “We have long-term experience in combining the active ingredients offered by wild Arctic nature with advanced science to create efficient skincare products,” described president and CEO  . “Our raw materials include, among other things, Finnish berries, such as the Arctic blueberry, Arctic lingonberry and fresh, pure spring water.” Berries are the source of innovation for this firm. Focused on skin and hair care, professional medical cosmetics products are made with the goal of using natural Finnish materials. Their beauty products are also eco-friendly. “The composition of berry seed oils contains omega fatty acids and natural vitamin E, which are beneficial for skin,” explains  , quality manager. “Berries contain natural vitamins, antioxidants and minerals. Berries are skin conditioning and skin soothing ingredients. They have antioxidant, anti-inflammation and antimicrobial effects.” This firm specialises in extracting raw materials and minerals from trees, berries and plants from Lapland’s forests without hard chemicals, responding to a worldwide appeal to replace synthetic chemicals with natural ones. “The plants of the northern forest contain much more polyphenols, anthocyans and other antioxidants than the same plants when they grow in the south. This is due to the midnight sun,” describes CEO  . “We wanted to develop a technology to extract the effective compound fro the plants without hard chemicals.” You may be prepared to put berry minerals on your skin – but have you considered wood? After wild Finnish forests are harvested and processed, this firm utilises the industry’s side products, which contain valuable bio-compounds, modifying them to biodegradable ingredients. “I have always loved nature, and the clean organic Finnish forest has been close to my heart,” founder and CEO   explains. “We want to offer ingredients with high ethical acceptance and that are based on renewable materials and can be produced even in larger scales.” Letting nature treat the skin can also be the solution for more difficult scenarios. The idea of this medical company is to harness the natural strength and healing properties from spruce resin. Its products can be used for treating wounds, burns and some infections. “Nature-based products are seen positively around the world, but the challenge is their varying quality. Some work, some do not. This is why we emphasise scientific research,” explained CEO  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ukko-seals-moments-celebration-steel/,Ukko seals moments of celebration in steel,"This company has turned the concept of a hipflask into a simplistic design piece that is already starting to spread Ukko moments around the world.  Jani Jaatinen’s own Ukko moments are found by the water in the Ostrobothnian archipelago in Finland. Even though the basic idea of a hipflask is convenient for example on a hunting trip, the flask itself has lost its value in the eyes of many. When  , the CEO and designer of  , was searching for a new type of business gift 10 years ago, this became the starting point that eventually lead to the elegant drinking tube called Ukkomatti. The focus is not on drinking, but on sealing a memory. “For example, when you climb to the top of a mountain, it’s about celebrating that moment, a toast for the small things in life,” Jaatinen says. “The world is moving to a direction where we invest in our spare time and in these moments.” Therefore, a decade ago, Jaatinen set out to fill the lack of high quality gifts for men. At that time he was running his first own business, where gift packages of wine and whiskey were sold as business gifts, and the aim was to add something new to the mix. The thought of making a cup out of steel originally came from steel tubes used in the metal industry. “I liked the idea of using laser welding to make a cup out of a tube,” says Jaatinen. “Nobody else in the world, as far as I know, has done that.” The initial product was well received even though the steel shot glasses were, in many senses, rough around the edges. It was not until 2015 that the real Ukko was born, after thousands of hours spent branding and conceptualising. The result was a lifestyle concept of ‘Ukko moments’ in the Finnish nature, where the drinking tube forms a part of life’s small celebrations. Jaatinen also wanted the brand to showcase Finnishness in a new way and created a visual world combining the Nordic god Ukko ( ) and blacksmithery. Although the products are not made by a blacksmith, the profession is a father figure to today’s metal artisans and thus honours the Finnish handicraft that goes into the product. Ukko drinking receptacles are 100 per cent Finnish and manufactured in co-operation between metal industry professionals and artisans. The company’s flagship product, Ukkomatti, is a thin steel tube made with CNC metalwork by   and   and then laser welded by  . Finally, the tube is encased with a leather piece handmade in Kauhava and designed to resemble the iconic Finnish Kauhava knifes. Since every Ukkomatti is signed with a unique serial number that can be traced on Ukko’s webpage, the product is impossible to replicate. The idea of individual moments of celebration has gotten a huge response on social media where people are sharing their pictures from Ukko moments and telling genuine stories about their ancestors. “The uniqueness lies in a timeless design that combines traditional handicraft with high-tech metalwork,” says Jaatinen. By only using steel as material and welding as the production method, Ukkomatti is much more hygienic than traditional tin hipflasks and does not contain any impurities. “This is basically a tank to transport and store noble beverages,” says Jaatinen. “The tube steers out the right aromas and with the thin mouthpiece it functions as any fine brandy glass.” Now Ukko sells Ukkomatti flasks as well as a birch cases of steel shot glasses to businesses and private customers with an annual turnover of about a million euros. The enthusiastic entrepreneur does not rest for too long when it comes to expansions or new ideas. This autumn, a slightly bigger tube meant for coffee or tea will hit the market as a new version of the traditional Finnish “ ”, and the plan is to create a more feminine version of Ukkomatti plated in 24-karat gold, cased in white leather and decorated with a diamond. In the future, Jaatinen hopes to co-brand with big liquor houses, such as Hennessy. Ukko has also managed to charm the Japanese: the import company Cornes Corporation decided to add Ukko’s products to its offering. Cornes represents many well-known brands, including Bentley and Ferrari. “The thing that attracted the Japanese was Finland – Ukko is a way of selling Finland,” says Jaatinen. “We couldn’t have found a better partner.” Since the lifestyle story of individual Ukko moments is a crucial part of the product, Jaatinen went down to Japan to personally train the Japanese sales representatives. Today, Ukko products are sold in Japan, Sweden, Australia, Germany, Norway and Russia, all drawn by the same thing. “The moments in Finnish nature are attractive: you buy a place, quality, handicraft and a feeling,” Jaatinen summarises."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mumin-kaffe-opens-doors-everyone/,Mumin Kaffe opens doors for everyone,"Mumin Kaffe café chain wants to create a space where everyone feels welcome – and confusing Moomins with hippos is cool, too. Buggies are parked by tables in a café that has windows the size of walls, letting in the rare glimpses of Helsinki’s October sunshine. Children are laughing in the play area, and a woman wearing an apron is serving a cinnamon bun to a customer looking to satisfy a sweet tooth. Steam flows out of a mug decorated with Moomin characters and filled with tea that smells and tastes like blueberry muffins. Suvi Kataja and her children Ella and Anni make use of Mumin Kaffe’s play area. Sound like any coffee shop around the corner? Not so much. “I know what it’s like to go to a café with children,”   founder   says. “It’s a pretty sweaty, nerve-wrecking experience, and sometimes you can feel really unwelcome.” At Mumin Kaffe, things are different. Children are particularly well received, to the point that staff serves kids first and adults last. No one’s complaining about happy screams or occasional signs of upset. Kiiski, mother of three, created the café concept under very unfortunate circumstances. Her son had been diagnosed with cancer, which meant uncountable hours, days, weeks and months at the hospital. Kiiski had time to think about new directions – and the experience brought along much more confidence and courage. “As long as it’s not a matter of life and death, everything is worth a shot,” she explains. “I’ve become hungry for trying out new things and allergic to categorisations and assumptions that stop people from pursuing their dreams.” Now Kiiski’s child has recovered, and she keeps busy with various projects. One of them is Mumin Kaffe, which now has five branches in Finland and one in Stockholm and is rapidly spreading to new locations. The idea to add Moomins to the café chain’s brand came from Kiiski’s friend, designer  . She, having worked with Moomin characters before, brought the owners of Moomin creator  ’s heritage and Mumin Kaffe founders to the same table. The signed contract gives Mumin Kaffe a license to use Moomin characters in Europe and a few other countries. Moomins, of course, add to the intrigue raised by the cafés. However, not everyone dropping by for a hot drink or a glass of juice are familiar with the creatures. “We’ve had people ask, ‘What are these hippos?’,” Kiiski tells. “We’ve responded by telling the original Moomin story about how they were captured and taken to a zoo because they were mistaken for hippos then, too.” So not only are the cafés taking advantage of Moomins’ reputation: they are also introducing the dearly beloved stories, as well as Jansson’s wide range of other art, to those who haven’t stumbled across them before. The main markets are those where Moomins are already popular. The next café will open in Rovaniemi, Lapland, and Tallinn is in the queue for next year. Hot beverages are, of course, served in official Moomin mugs. Other Nordic countries as well as the UK are known for their fondness of the Moomins, but Kiiski won’t shine a light on future locations as of yet. She does reveal that for Mumin Kaffe, a bit like for Moomintroll, the earth is full of wonders. “We’re full of enthusiasm and the world is wide open,” Kiiski notes. “Our plans are big: in five years, 50 branches around the world, and not just in Europe.” Mumin Kaffe is owned by three people, one of them being Kiiski herself, and currently it has about 30 staff members. Kiiski estimates that about 70 per cent of the people working in the cafés are over 50 years old – and it’s no accident. “We’re always looking to recruit those who’ve struggled to find work, like long-term unemployed and older people,” she explains. “Now we’re finding ways to offer jobs to people with disabilities.” This will be the case wherever Mumin Kaffe goes. For Kiiski, it’s extremely important to be able to contribute to the wellbeing of others whenever possible. “It’s not about helping, when both parties are on the receiving end,” she points out. “It’s about providing opportunities to those who can help you back.” Kiiski also deems herself very lucky. Not only did her little boy get incredible care for almost no cost when he was ill, she also points out that she’s a white female living in a Western society with democratic values. “I’m so lucky with all of my privileges that there are loads of reasons for me to do as much as I can,” she says. “I’ve been given so much that I want to be able to give, too.” Mumin Kaffe co-founder Sanna Kiiski"

Since the company’s first steps, the growth rate has been as speedy as – well, like that of a newborn baby. Applicado’s offspring is an app known as Layette, a word referring to baby gear such as clothes and accessories. In 2016, the company was chosen as the winner of the Digital Health category in the growth company competition  . That brought a huge boost with mentoring, funding, contacts and workspace. Now, Applicado is run by four owners and two employees, one of whom takes care of coding and the other working in sales. The first version of the app has been launched in Finland, but the most tempting markets lie outside of the country’s borders. Welcome to Times Square, Layette! “We’re an international company by default,” CTO   points out. “What we provide is readily available in Finland anyway, so our goal is to take it further.” The information is abundant indeed. At the moment, the app comprises hundreds of pages of text, articles and tips from the very first days of pregnancy all the way through to when the child is a toddler. Whenever authorities change their recommendations, Layette is updated as well. “If a new mother goes online in search of answers, she’ll just end up confused,” Havukainen tells. “With Layette, she can trust that the information is up-to-date, unbiased and impartial and comes from experts in a non-judgmental tone, unlike personal experiences and opinions people post on the Internet.” The next big leap is to find investors and partners. Layette is free for families, so the revenue must be collected from elsewhere. Existing partners include, for example, a pharmaceutical company. Other options are plentiful, such as insurance firms and baby product manufacturers. The app could remind the parents-to-be when the deadline for buying an insurance for their unborn child approaches. “I’ve got two kids and I forgot to buy the insurance twice,” Pihl says laughingly. “It would’ve been great to receive a reminder from somewhere!” Pihl and Havukainen emphasise that all partnerships need to be a win-win, so that the families benefit from it too. Hence customisation is necessary: if the user is looking for information about ear infections, Layette can tell them which products can be of help, not advertise diapers. The grand plan is, eventually, to have maternity clinics use Layette – and even make it their selling point in countries where private healthcare is the norm, such as Havukainen’s former home base the US. As human bodies function in the same way no matter the geography, future markets are dictated by where partners are found. Applicado wants to see Layette become a standard in the field. “One day we hope to see clinics advertise themselves with ‘the best maternity knowledge in the world’ – and us providing it,” Havukainen tells."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-eco-clothing/,Five for Friday: Eco clothing,"Pre-owned clothing and high-quality recyclables – what’s not to love?  In Finland, being ecological never goes out of fashion. Sustainability, waste and re-use are buzzwords driving a modern way of assessing attire. Designers are striving to wake awareness and interest in making more positive decisions regarding clothing, and a tradition of living in harmony with nature has inspired many Finnish firms to be at the forefront of addressing the eco-friendliness of your wardrobe. Whether you’re looking to treat your toddler or yourself, here are five ideas for a high quality stitch. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Aalto University have teamed up as a part of this forward-thinking EU project. The aim is to pioneer a new way of developing materials, by creating high-performance fibres from recycling and pre-consumer waste. “Turning unwanted textiles into raw materials for new textiles using ecological technologies provides an opportunity for revolutionising European textile manufacturing and trade,” described VTT’s research professor    . This mobile application is a flea market in the palm of your hand. With the goal of making it easier to distribute “pre-loved” clothing, this company also uses individually provided data to tailor to its users’ style. Zadaa’s success has led to global aspirations. , co-founder   described that the company has “a three-year five-step plan according to which we need to reach 150 countries by the third year. It’s ambitious but you have to be with a business like this that has an extremely scalable service.” There is one rule that this company follows in its clothing production: the only materials used are those that would otherwise go to waste. Pure Waste targets many elements of production, such as saving fresh water and textile waste – with an aim to make a global difference. “Recycling is no longer about finding the cheapest possible way to come up with some kind of mess; instead, the focus is on achieving the best possible end result,” described co-founder Jukka Pesola  . Children’s clothes are made with eco-friendliness and attention to un-toxic materials. Catering to the little ones, clothes are presented in storybooks with poems and activities. Papu has used crowdfunding to support their international endeavours to establish resellers in Europe, China and Australia. “When a new catalogue comes out, the products from the previous seasons still don’t get old. Hopefully the opposite will happen: sold-out clothes become sought-after affairs,” envisaged founder    . This multiple award-winning company seeks to ensure that new-borns are clad in carefully constructed clothes with invisible seams and un-toxic materials. Beibamboo also has a hospital range from preemies and new-borns. The designs take into account necessary tubes and wires to make it easier to change the baby’s clothes and minimise the risk of infection. “When she was treated in the hospital, I was surprised how unpractical the baby clothes were,” founder    , when her baby girl was born prematurely. “Especially since preemie babies are attached to all sorts of tubes and wires. Parent’s can’t even dress their own child.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/piceasoft-helps-extend-lifecycle-for-mobile-devices/,Piceasoft helps extend lifecycle for mobile devices,"Changing or reselling a smartphone can sometimes feel like an obstacle course of data transfers and cleanups. But tools to make the process easier already exist. There are billions of smartphones on the global market and most of their life-cycles could be elongated with correct device and data management. This is the view of  , CEO and co-founder of  . With a long career in the telecoms industry, he has seen how time and money are wasted on unnecessary device maintenance, complex data transfers and not recycling phones due to security scares. These are precisely the challenges Piceasoft tackles. It has created a software package for the smooth management of a mobile device’s entire lifecycle. “When you buy a new phone, we can transfer the content from your old device to the new one. When it seems to need maintenance, our software can diagnose whether it is necessary and do some basic repairs,” Roselius explains. “Finally, in a buyback or recycling situation, our software securely erases the device memory so it can never be returned.” Piceasoft has an impressive customer list to back its claims. Major mobile operators and retail chains, including Vodafone, Telefonica, Telenor and Elkjøp/Gigantti, use the company’s software in their stores to make changing or recycling a mobile device as painless for their customers as possible. “There will always be some kind of communication devices for which our tools are needed,” says Jyri Roselius. “For example, cars will be full of data. There will be more data to erase and transfer in 20 years’ time because data will be everywhere.” Like many startups in Finland, the roots of Piceasoft can be traced back to Nokia. Roselius and Piceasoft co-founders  ,   and   used to develop the telecom giant’s device management software ‘PC Suite’. When Nokia started to dismantle its mobile operations in 2012, the team didn’t want to see this software, which was used by 100 million daily users, go to waste. “We left Nokia as a spin-off and started our own company. Nokia supported us with starter money and by licensing the software to use for a reasonable price,” Roselius recalls. “Our first thought was how to make it easier for people to switch from one operating system to another.” From this sprouted Piceasoft’s first product, PiceaSwitch, for transferring content between devices and operating systems. It was launched in February 2013, only six months after the company was founded. Since then Piceasoft has grown to a team of 35 people and expanded its software package with two new tools: PiceaDiagnostics, which analyses a mobile device’s condition and maintenance needs and PiceaEraser, which securely (and certifiably) cleans up all data from it. Although competitors exist in all these areas, Piceasoft’s claim to fame is to be the only company to offer all three services. “Customers like it when they can buy everything they need from the same place,” Roselius says. “Also, we are the only company whose products can be used anywhere: on an industrial scale, in retail stores and even at home.” Today Piceasoft has customers in 60 countries, with the most substantial footholds in the Nordics and Germany. The company has also started its US expansion with support from the Young Innovative Company funding programme organised by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes. Its ambition is nothing short of being the market leader. But Piceasoft is also driven by greener values. Roselius believes its software has the potential to encourage more consumers to resell or recycle their old phones. “At the moment, when people stop using a phone, they often put it in a drawer somewhere as they aren’t comfortable with giving it away,” he explains. “With our software people can confidently give away their devices as they know they have certifiably been erased clean.” It is already a growing trend globally. Roselius estimates the value of the used mobile phone market is over 17 billion dollars and counting, which means millions of devices are in need of diagnostics and eraser services. But what about in 20 to 30 years from now, when smartphones might not even exist, will these tools still be relevant? Roselius is confident their demand will only grow. “That is so far in the future, I haven’t really thought about it,” he says with a laugh. “But there will always be some kind of communication devices for which our tools are needed. For example, cars will be full of data. There will be more data to erase and transfer in 20 years’ time because data will be everywhere.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/balmuir-s-finnish-fashion-has-global-appeal/,Balmuir’s Finnish fashion has global appeal,"Finnish company Balmuir counts the likes of George Clooney, Tina Turner and the Swedish royals among its customers. Now the family-run company has set its sights on building a global lifestyle brand. The turning point came for   10 years ago. She had forged a successful international career at Nokia Siemens Networks, but in the back of her mind she was always sketching clothes and home collections. Then came the devastating news she was not able to have children. For Jaara it was the moment she decided to focus on her dreams: the   lifestyle brand was born. Jaara was determined to follow her passion for handcrafted products and natural materials. Balmuir uses natural materials and targets the premium market with its fashion and home products. “I have always worked internationally so that was what I wanted to continue. I was in Frankfurt, I marched to the finest boutique on Opernblatz and showed them my designs. That is how it all started,” she recalls. “In 2010, we went to the world’s biggest interior design fair Maison&Objet in Paris and immediately with a big stand. We have always done these things with flair.” The gamble paid off. Today Balmuir’s products are sold in over 70 countries and its customers include star power from royals to Hollywood celebrities. The company’s fashion, home and gift products are stocked by some of Europe’s most famous department stores, including Liberty in London, TSUM in Moscow and Breuninger in Germany. The icing on the cake? It is not only Jaara’s business which has grown. Much to her surprise, Jaara became pregnant and she now has two children of her own. Jaara credits Balmuir’s success with its focus on quality, trustworthiness, being genuine and plenty of leg work. Notably in its early days, the company participated in six fairs per year in Paris alone. Balmuir uses natural materials and traditional craftsmanship and Jaara believes this is central to the brand’s appeal. Jaara cites her childhood home near Oulu in Northern Finland as the driver behind this and the region remains her biggest inspiration. “We like clear colours and nature. Where we live we are surrounded by it and at our vacation house, where we spend a lot of time, the closest street light is on the other side a lake,” she explains. “All our materials and colours come from nature, but we always have some exciting twist.” Balmuir’s designs include reindeer nappa gloves, salmon skin wallets and cufflinks covered with stingray leather. Many of the products are manufactured in Finland but Jaara also handpicked family run businesses across Europe, some which Balmuir backed to get off the ground. “The word ‘luxury’ is used too much and often wrongly today,” explains Heidi Jaara. “We offer everyday luxuries.” What comes next for Balmuir is brand stores. In Finland, it already has stores in Jaara’s home city of Oulu, and a Helsinki store opened in August. Now Balmuir is looking to expand internationally. “We want to keep our great retail partners, but also build our own brand store network,” Jaara explains. “They are more like showrooms, it’s a place where people can see and feel the products. The concept is more about appealing to the senses.” Like everything Jaara does, here Balmuir’s plans are ambitious: the company aims to open 20 stores over the next five years. Be brave, be curious and get to know your markets, this is what Balmuir has lived by and it is the advice Jaara passes on to all aspiring entrepreneurs. “Buy a plane ticket and go to the most important fair in your industry. See the buzz and the trends and think what could you do differently,” Jaara says. ”Mistakes happen, but the important thing is to define what is the twist you can offer and what are the values of your company. ”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/dispelix-opens-our-eyes-to-augmented-reality/,Dispelix opens our eyes to augmented reality,"The stylish augmented reality glasses of sci-fi movies are still far removed from the bulky eyewear of today, but Finnish startup Dispelix might just have the technology to bring the future a little closer.  Smart glasses are already available in multiple shapes, sizes and degrees of ‘smartness’, but they are still a rare sight in everyday use. The likes of Microsoft’s HoloLens can offer a full blown augmented reality (AR) experience, but come with a hefty price tag and resemble more helmets than glasses, while those that look like normal sunglasses tend to come with limited features. But   believes it has the tools to change this. The startup has developed a see-through display technology which brings high-resolution visual information directly into the user’s field of vision. These full-colour displays can be easily integrated into any lens design and turn even ordinary eyewear into immersive AR glasses. “Our displays bring another world, a virtual image layer, on top of the real world,” explains  , CEO and co-founder of Dispelix. “This can be used for instructions, information and entertainment.” Sunnari gives a few practical examples. Instead of reaching for our phones or checking our smart watches, we could have the same information projected onto our eyeglasses with no limitations to our field of vision. Or the displays could be embedded into protective gear so a welder could receive instructions directly into their visor without having to stop working. “Virtual reality is already here, but augmented reality is only getting started,” says Antti Sunnari. “It has the potential to one day replace smartphones, tablets, TVs, everything.” Dispelix is a newcomer to the market, but the science behind its optics and display manufacturing technology dates back to 2011. At the time Sunnari and co-founder   started developing the technology at the VTT Technical Research Center of Finland. In late 2015, they finally decided it was ready for commercialisation and Dispelix was born. Although see-through displays aren’t a novelty, Dispelix has succeeded in something others haven’t: making them extremely thin, high-performing and (crucially) suitable for mass-manufactured consumer products. This combination has already helped the company raise   in funding, and earlier this year it was selected by US data analysis firm Quid as one of the  . In two years Dispelix has also grown to 14 employees and secured its first customers. The startup is keeping details hush for now, but Sunnari hints that Dispelix displays could soon be seen in various application including sports, consumer electronics and industry use. He believes AR glasses could eventually even replace our beloved smartphones, tablets and TVs. “We have customers in many sectors. AR will be a huge revolution in all aspects of life. Not only in consumer electronics, but the way we work, advertise, everything,” Sunnari enthuses. “It is hard to imagine a job where being able to access additional information while keeping your hands free wouldn’t be beneficial. Also, what do you need a TV for if AR glasses can provide a bigger and better image?” Dispelix’s immediate targets are consumer electronics and industrial companies in Asia and the US, where Sunnari says practically all the significant players preside. The startup has no plans to develop its own end-user products, but instead it has set its goal as becoming the ‘Intel of smart glasses’. While Dispelix is expanding its sales team and fine tuning its displays, Sunnari believes the company already has the technology to fit three core AR trends he sees developing. First is integration into professional equipment for crucial hands-free information (think welders, even surgeons), secondly fashionable Google Glass-style smart glasses and finally the next generation of bulkier but more immersive AR visors used by gamers. But for Dispelix this is just the start. Looking into the future, Sunnari believes the visions of sci-fi are achievable. He stresses technological leaps typically take a decade but in 20–30 years AR will be so seamlessly integrated into our lives we will have entirely new ways of communicating. “At that point, our devices could communicate directly with our brains, if people are ready for that. I believe that will be the next big leap forward,” Sunnari says. “30 years ago, we couldn’t envision many of the technologies we have today. And it is exactly those things [we cannot foresee] that will be the most revolutionary.” Dispelix’s display innovation challenge smart glass technology by enabling affordable mass production, high quality and integration with ordinary eyewear."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-legal-and-strategic-design/,Five for Friday: Legal and strategic design,"The word design springs to mind messy sketchbooks, not neatly organised forms and lawful contracts – or does it? Let Finns lead the way. Like   pointed out  , the third success story of Finnish design might as well be legal. Last week, legal and strategic design experts gathered together at   in Helsinki to feed the buzz that can be felt around the growing phenomenon that wants to improve the UX of the letter of the law.  popped by to sense the vibrating air. Let us introduce some of the players in the team of Finnish frontrunners. As one of the organisers of the summit, this Helsinki- and London-based   believes that legal design approach introduces a much needed human-centricity and usability to the field of law. “Finland has been a trailblazing country in design since the 1950s and its current expertise in service design has a worldwide prominence,” notes client service director  . “The combination of this design legacy and its established and globally appreciated legal system makes Finland the perfect leader in legal design.” Legal design will change the way law is done – nothing less, says  . The law firm will soon launch Dot., a legal design consultancy and sister brand for Dottir. According to partner Antti Innanen, more and more organisations are recognising the measurable value and results legal design can deliver. “Research shows that design-driven organisations and industries consistently perform best,” he mentions. “It’s time that law reaped the benefits.” Lexpert’s mission is to create user-centred and business-friendly contracts. Contract coach   and legal information designer   find it refreshing to finally see the world awakening to legal design and understanding how contracts and law can be used proactively to prevent problems. “Our goal is ease of doing business,” they say. “When it comes to current contracts, we see not only waste of time and money, but also wasted opportunity. Well-designed contracts are managerial tools that capture goals and commitments and simplify understanding, collaboration and coordination. They can be so much more than legal tools used only if a dispute arises!” ‘s law and technology project aims to combine high-quality research, experimentation and training of tomorrow’s lawyers. The lab produces information relating to the effects that technology has on law as well as experiments with how technology may be used to better legal processes in general. “Legal design is not only about usability but also about designing systems that inherently take into consideration, for example, privacy issues or issues around bias,” project developer  points out. “Technology in itself is neutral. Design choices dictate the outcome of applying technology, and it is extremely important to understand the role design plays in technological development.” Founded in New York and now operating in Helsinki, Wevolve is about to launch a new organisational service called Whole Work, which aims to bridge “the dreadful gap” between strategy and reality. The company notes that the Finnish design scene has always positioned itself as an enabler for a better society. “The biggest opportunities for value creation, transformation, innovation and whatnot exist in today’s new normal in the realm of strategic design,” says  , strategy and design director at Wevolve. “Being strategic means we don’t start just by ripping the brief, but also unlearning what we know about the topic, challenging our worldview and building alternative mental models, business models and organisational models for our clients. “"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/aiven-helps-lift-business-cloud/,Aiven helps lift your business to the cloud,"This Finnish company aims to take care of its clients’ online database needs, taking the hassle out of software infrastructure management. When you think about it, databases pretty much rule the world today. Practically every modern online service relies on a database, and companies are frantically seeking ways to one-up their competitors by better exploiting their datasets. But for smaller firms, with little resources to invest in their own online database service, it can be a challenge to make a splash in this brave new world. Enter  . The company’s value proposition is straightforward: it promises to handle its client companies’ cloud database needs, relieving them from the burden of maintaining their own database infrastructure and allowing them to focus on developing and building their own products. What distinguishes Aiven from other cloud service providers is its focus on open-source database products. This means that the big cloud infrastructure suppliers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are both Aiven’s partners and competitors. “Their services overlap with ours, but we also complement them,“ says Aiven CEO  . “Our clients get access to the traditional products the big players offer. But we also offer solutions that go beyond their environments.” Compared to these proprietary systems, Saarenmaa says that open-source solutions offer certain advantages. Firstly, clients can easily migrate from one cloud service provider to another, or use two simultaneously. Secondly, the rate of innovation is high in the open-source area, as companies around the world contribute to creating and refining solutions. Thirdly, as open-source solutions are typically used in development environments, clients are often already familiar with them, making the process of moving to the cloud simple. You can be playful even while doing things properly. In the beginning, the company anticipated that especially small tech firms would be interested in its services, but its clientele has turned out to be much more varied. Aiven’s client companies range from large industrial firms to start-ups, and its solutions are used for a variety of services, from restaurant booking systems and ticketing services to retail sales optimisation and logistics operations. “It’s interesting that a large part of our client base are not really in the software business at all, but manufacture physical end products,” Saarenmaa says. “For these companies their main focus is on developing their own products, so rather than spending resources on their own database solutions, our services help sort out the infrastructure side of things.” Launching its first products in the beginning of 2016, Aiven was founded by a group of former F-Secure employees with background in database management and information security. The firm completed its first funding round this summer,  . This will help the young company accelerate its growth, boost its sales and marketing efforts as well as helping in product development. The main project in the near future for the company is opening an office in the US: as over half of the its client companies are based in the country, Aiven wants to have a presence there to better serve its US-based customers. While most cloud service providers settle for a rather abstract visual identity, Aiven’s logo – a friendly red crab – stands out from the crowd. “We couldn’t decide between the different options, so in the end I asked my daughter, who was three at the time, to choose her favourite,” Saarenmaa says. “But the logo does feel appropriate for us: it shows that we do things a bit differently, and that you can be playful even while doing things properly.” The company’s playful approach is tipped to head Stateside in the near future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/varjo-brings-clarity-vr-revolution/,Varjo brings clarity to the VR revolution,"What if we could see virtual reality (VR) worlds as clearly as we see everything around us? This could soon be more than science fiction, thanks to a unique display technology from Finnish startup Varjo. When Varjo (‘shadow’ in Finnish) revealed a prototype of its virtual reality headset in June, it caused quite a stir amongst the technology media. The reason why is simple: while several VR glasses already exist, the immersiveness of their experience is hindered by the slightly blurred images these products provide. But Varjo has found a way to solve this. “We bring human-eye resolution to VR, which no one has done before,” explains  , CEO and co-founder of Varjo. “We believe this can revolutionise how companies use VR.” Varjo claims it can achieve resolution that is 70 times better than any current head-mounted display, including well-known brands like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The technology works by mimicking how the human eye moves. Varjo’s technology (which it calls ‘bionic display’) follows the user’s gaze and offers a crystal-clear image wherever their focus is. The consequences of this open up a whelm of new possibilities for VR, particularly in professional environments. When clarity is not an issue, pilots can replace expensive flight simulators with VR headsets, architects can walk inside a virtual building to adjust their designs and engineers can practice hazardous training in complete safety. Varjo believes plenty of similar applications exists across various field, including the automotive industry, construction, design and education. And the startup is not alone in this belief. According to Konttori, they were contacted by over 300 large companies after the prototype (codenamed ‘20/20’) was first announced. “Many were skeptical, but when we went to show the technology, for example to a large German car manufacturer, they tried the demo for 30 seconds and said they were interested,” he says. “This shows there is a lot of demand for VR technology, but so far it hasn’t been suitable for professional use.” The past year has been quite a ride. In the summer of 2016 Varjo founders Konttori,  ,   and  had just left developing new technologies at Microsoft when they were asked to do a quick virtual reality demo for a Finnish startup. Its investors saw the demo, and suddenly the quartet had seed funding in their pocket to start a company. Urho Konttori expects professional usage to be the next significant trend in the VR world. He is particularly interested to see how it will change education and training, where experiences can replace passive reading and lectures. “In practice, we walked out as entrepreneurs, although we didn’t initially have any plans for that,” Konttori recalls. The founders decided to seize the moment and Varjo was born. They started by developing technology for video-based VR, but soon found the image quality of existing headsets didn’t match up to their vision. “This was when we decided to build our own display,” Konttori explains. “We realised if we brought super high resolution specifically to the area the eye focuses on, we can achieve the standard of human-eye resolution a lot faster than with any other technology.” By March 2017, Varjo’s display technology was granted a US patent and six months later the startup   led by Sweden’s EQT Ventures. In 14 months, the company has grown from four founders to over 30 employees and has recruited talent from Intel, Microsoft, Nokia, Nvidia and Rovio. Now they are working hard to get a developer version of Varjo’s headset ready by early 2018, with commercial shipping to follow within the year. Business users are the primary target, but Konttori stresses they haven’t forgotten about consumers. While the cost of the headset will initially be prohibitive, he hopes it will scale to consumer prices over the next two to three years. Varjo’s ambitions aren’t limited to VR. Its next step will be expanding into augmented reality (AR, where virtual elements are added into the real world) and mixed reality (MR) where it believes the 20/20 headset has the potential to be an ideal fit. This is because its integrated cameras capture the outside world while its graphics chips can add virtual elements into this field of vision. AR and MR are a step closer to the next technological transformation Varjo wants realise. While in its infancy the company believes in 20 to 30 years we could live in a world where reality and the virtual reality are almost indistinguishable. “If the first transformation was text-based computers, the second graphics interfaces, the third mobile, then the fourth is immersive technology,” Konttori explains. “We are at the point where we can help ignite this transformation and if we help to start it, we also want to lead it.” “Virtual reality will become mundane, unnoticeable and ever-present,” Urho Konttori (right) envisions. “It will also reduce the number of physical goods we have and create a completely new market of virtual goods. If kids now want a dog, in future it could be replaced by a virtual dog.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/onar-s-ecological-sustainable-fashion-turns-heads/,"ONAR’s ecological, sustainable fashion turns heads","Irene Kostas fuses together traditional craftsmanship, ethical materials and an urban, futuristic vision with her clothing brand ONAR. It is these unlikely combinations that have seen her designs gain global attention.  These are clothes that stand out. When you step into  ’s flagship store in central Helsinki, you are greeted by coats, vests and accessories in bright colours, soft leather and urban, geometrical shapes. What connects all the designs is the use of pre-existing, ethically sourced materials. “The idea was to break the traditional connotations around fur and use natural materials from an ethical and ecological background. Thus, ONAR as a concept has been acknowledged as pioneer work within the industry. This is also visible in my style language,” says Irene Kostas, founder of the brand. “Heritage and roots are important to me, but at the same time I aim to revolutionise tradition, be contemporary and look forward.  We encourage people to be brave and distinctive.” ONAR brand uses ethical and ecologically sourced leather and lamb shearling. Kostas has the same uncompromising approach to her choice of materials. She researched them for two years before finding the right fit in Merino and Toscana leather and shearling and only when it’s sourced as a food industry byproduct. These materials are then transformed into garments in the hands of small producers in Greece, Finland and Estonia. The appreciation for local production and natural materials derives already from Kostas’ childhood. 
“My parents are craftsmen specialised in fur and leather, so I have witnessed the clothes manufacturing process since I was a child,” she explains. “Natural materials have always been close to my heart.” The name ONAR (which means ‘dream’ in ancient Greek) comes from the name of a monthly club where Kostas DJs in Helsinki. When she started her own clothing brand in 2014, she wanted it to echo the same themes of mixing cultures, organic sounds, electronic music and futurism. “I’ve always integrated into my music the fact I have grown up in two different cultures, Northern Finland and Greece. I felt this meant I could give something new to the fashion world as well,” Kostas says. “From the Nordic side comes the appreciation for clean nature, functionalism and the pureness of form, and from Greece and the Middle East the rich textures and colour schemes.” This mix came to fruition in ONAR’s first collection, which was showcased at Paris Fashion Week in late 2014. It is also where her brand was discovered by US-based urban concept store Opening Ceremony. What made this a significant feather in Kostas’ cap is it’s industry tradition to follow new brands for several seasons before stocking them. Since then Kostas has been selected among the fashion icon Vogue’s Young Talent finalists, opened her first store in Helsinki and found retailers in metropolitan cities across Asia, Europe and the US. In particular ONAR has raised interest in Japan and South Korea, which are also its biggest markets. In fact, when we meet, Kostas has just returned from Seoul. “People there are receptive to new phenomena and, what is important for us, they appreciate high quality,” she enthuses. “But our primary goal is not to target specific markets, it is to get a global foothold in stores that fit ONAR’s profile.” ONAR Studios opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Helsinki in 2016. When it comes to the direction the fashion industry is moving, Kostas identifies several trends. She believes the prevailing beauty ideals are giving way to more diversity and genderless thinking. It is the future Kostas also sees for ONAR. “So far it has been a resources issue, but we are taking ONAR in the direction where we have a lot more unisex clothes,” she explains. “Personally, I think more attention will be paid to minorities in fashion. Also, being political is a major trend. You cannot afford to be neutral, you have to make a stand.” A stand ONAR is already taking is against the ever-faster cycle of fashion. The design house brings out two collections a year, instead of continuously pushing out new lines. “[Fast cycle] collections don’t even have time to sell, it’s crazy. It isn’t sustainable in any way and there must become a point when it changes,” Kostas says. “I believe the future of fashion will be more interdisciplinary. You can already see this in some brands which are creating collaborations. The borders of what is fashion will get blurred.”"

In 2004,   was both happy and unhappy at the same time. She had purchased her first menstrual cup, a reusable feminine hygiene product that collects menstrual fluid instead of absorbing it. Founder and CEO Heli Kurjanen The idea was great, she thought. The cup lasts for years, so using it saves money and produces less waste than tampons and sanitary pads, and the material can be safer than fibre-filled tampons. Only the delivery was lacking. “I was really content with the product, but there were small things I didn’t like about the design,” she tells. “As I was complaining about it to my husband, he half-jokingly told me to make a better one myself.” Kurjanen did indeed. The stay-at-home mother in her early 20s drew sketches on paper and introduced them to a family friend with expertise in silicone products. Once the prototypes were ready, she asked her girlfriends to give the cup a go and provide feedback. Everyone was thrilled. “It’s all happened pretty quickly really,” Kurjanen notes. “But somehow everything just started to fall into place right away, like I was always supposed to do this.” For example, a Finnish eco shop chain got in touch with Kurjanen saying that customers are continuously asking for the product – although the only thing available at the time was the landing page of the company’s website. Lune Group’s silicone-made   cups are a perfected version of the product Kurjanen tried out in 2004. They come in two sizes and different colours, have a flat and short stem and are easy to keep clean. Lunette also has its own range of antibacterial towels and cleaning products. The cups were launched in 2005. Now, 85 per cent of the business is international, the products are for sale in 40 countries and available globally on the company’s webstore. The biggest markets are the US, France, Germany and the Nordics, with China continuously growing. Through the online store, orders come in from all over the world. “Sometimes we have to use Google to find out where we’re shipping to, as we might’ve never heard of the place,” Kurjanen says laughingly. Despite the global reach, the headquarters remain in the small village of Juupajoki in central Finland. Lunette’s product range includes stuff to help keep the cup clean. “It’s good to be in the countryside,” Kurjanen notes – and laughs again. “If anything, we get sympathy points for making international business yet staying away from the city!” On top of Kurjanen and her husband, the office in their house employs seven staff members. A subsidiary in the US is run by further two. In Europe, menstrual cups are considered a consumer product. However, in the US and Australia they’re treated as medical devices, which made entering the markets a little complex. Still Kurjanen sees the classification as a good thing. “It ensures the safety and quality standards of the product,” she points out. Every day,   in the world are on their period. This means the customer flow isn’t drying out for Lunette – but also that not every one of these 800 million have access to a menstrual cup or other hygiene products. This is why the company also has a social agenda in its business. “Before Lunette, I didn’t understand what a huge effect periods have on women and equality,” Kurjanen says. “Now that we have a product that can make a difference, it would be utterly stupid not to take the opportunity.” In poor countries, buying sanitary pads can mean less money for food for the family, or women on their period might not be able to work – which, again, affects the family’s finances. “Initially I was concerned about how these women could keep their menstrual cups clean. Then I heard that some girls use small rocks to block the blood flow, and I realised our cup is still a million times better.” When Lunette donates cups through charitable partners, it’s not just giving a free product. The cup comes with educational materials about periods as well as sexual and reproductive health. In the Western world, Lunette works with homeless charities. A global issue the company is battling is period stigma by collaborating with partners such as  . For example, the names of female body parts shouldn’t be seen as swearwords. “We’re continuously trying to broaden the discussion and talk about things with their real names.” Lune Group has worked with women in developing countries, including these Kenyan ladies."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/huoleti-connects-patients-with-those-who-care/,Huoleti connects patients with those who care,"When you are faced with a severe illness or injury, everyday tasks can suddenly become a struggle. Now Finnish healthtech startup Huoleti is on a mission to make asking for help a breeze.  is built around the idea that people want to offer assistance but don’t always know how. This is particularly prescient when someone close to you falls ill or gets injured. The company removes these issues with a mobile app of the same name, which effortlessly connects patients and their friends, families, peers and volunteer helpers. A patient can invite their loved ones to join the app and when they need help – whether it’s picking up milk or walking their dog – send out a request to their support group. “You don’t have to ask anyone separately; the request goes to everyone in your network,” explains  , Huoleti CEO and co-founder. “It lowers the barrier for asking help and no one has to say they can’t help. Instead, those who can reply to the request do and the patient then chooses whose help they would like.” The app, which is currently in a pilot phase, also doubles as a peer-to-peer social support network. When you battle with health issues, talking with others in the same situation can be a crucial coping mechanism. Huoleti enables this by showing other app users with similar illnesses nearby, making it easy for them to connect both online and in real life. Huoleti’s mobile app helps create a peer support network for people with health challenges and their loved ones. The challenges Huoleti addresses are all too familiar to its co-founder and COO  , whose daughter has type 1 diabetes. She says the diagnosis came as a complete shock and was compounded by the fact she didn’t know anyone in the same situation. “Yes, we got the proper treatment but there were so many questions, and fear concerning your child’s health, how to manage everyday situations and so on,” Lipsonen recalls. “I started a support group, but meeting once a month wasn’t enough. Then we created a Facebook group, but it quickly became too crowded. The need for better peer support channels is huge.” Consequently, Lipsonen was immediately hooked when she heard about Savin’s idea for a dedicated peer-to-peer support network. At the time Savin was developing an early version of Huoleti for a cancer services innovation competition and Lipsonen wanted to help. The app won the competition. “We got very positive feedback that there is need for this kind of a service. The app also raised interest among investors,” Lipsonen says. “So, in January 2017 we made the brave decision to leave our day jobs and become startup entrepreneurs.” And the duo, who share a background in Nokia, haven’t looked back. Initially the Huoleti app was developed in collaboration with cancer associations and patients, but it has since been expanded to cover various illnesses, injuries and wellbeing challenges. The service was also opened up to volunteers, such as healthcare students, who can offer their help to those who don’t have families closeby. The target for Huoleti is to release the app’s first commercial version in Finland by early 2018. Development has been boosted by the startup’s partnership with various Finnish health associations, pension insurance company Etera and a collaboration agreement with multinational healthcare giant Roche. Savin and Lipsonen have also scouted opportunities in the US, which is attractive for its considerable market potential and investor base. “Our goal is to be a support network that is always in your pocket, no matter where you are in the world,” Savin says. “We want this to grow into a global service.” Huoleti is filling a gap missed by existing health care services, but Savin hopes it will also help drive a broader trend of caring for others. She is getting tired of the current wellbeing obsessions with self-monitoring and individual coaching. “I believe communal services are on the rise, which will have a wider effect on the society,” she explains. “At the moment people are diverging from one another, but technology has the potential to brings us back together with peer networks."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/aku-louhimies-puts-finnish-bravery-centre-stage/,Aku Louhimies puts Finnish bravery centre stage,"Finland’s most expensive film of all time broke box office records when it hit cinemas locally in early November. Now, Unknown Soldier is set to take a classic Finnish war story to international markets. Although his film   has recently premiered in Finland to significant fanfare, director   maintains a calm demeanour as he discusses the project in a downtown Helsinki café. After a few minutes of talking, two things become abundantly clear: his passion for filmmaking is palpable, and the release of   represents the final chapter of a story which stretches back to his youth; a time before he had even considered a career in the film industry. “The idea was born when I was serving in the military – as is mandatory in Finland,” Louhimies remembers. “I thought watch duty was boring so I found a pocket-size version of  novel, which I read in secret.” The story of a Finnish platoon battling Russia for over three years of World War II made a lasting impression on him. Later the Finnish director and screenwriter would go on to make a name for himself with award-winning movies such as  ,   and  , as well as his first international breakthrough, the Netflix series  . Then, about two-and-a-half years ago, the time was ripe to return to that thought from three decades ago – just in time for Finland’s centennial celebrations. Aku Louhimies describes himself as passionate, happy and curious. To him The Unknown Soldier marks the most significant moment in his career so far. Louhimies’ plan to adapt the Finnish classic gathered steam after getting several private investors on board, including the people behind  , and developing a script based on  ’s original novel. “The story is a sort of phenomenon in Finland and it felt good to be able to take on a classic like this,” says Louhimies. “It could be described as a Finnish   or  .” Since being published in 1954 the book has inspired several plays, operas and films, but Louhimies’ adaption is the first motion picture to also use the book’s uncensored original manuscript. In the resultant movie, witty lines and beautiful Finnish forest landscapes are mixed with the harsh reality of war and its impact on the soldiers. “This is a story about people – I was intrigued by how people change when exposed to a long crisis,” says Louhimies. “For me it was important to make three-dimensional characters.” The storyline thus includes snapshots from the home front interspersed between raining grenades and gunfire showers. After three hours, this juxtaposition equips audiences with its rousing theme of men from different parts of Finland coming together to fight for a common cause. The movie was shot entirely on location, deep in the untouched Finnish forests using no artificial lights or studios and minimal visual effects. The logistical challenges of the production infused an authentic flavour to the movie. Helping to build the sense of being part of a team, the cast was sent to a boot camp for military training to prepare for the shoot. Needless to say, there were no hotels or trailers on offer during the entire 81 days on set. The story is flavoured with broad Finnish dialects that highlight the country’s diversity. “In one sense this has been a central point of strength for Finland – we have united when needed,” says Louhimies (in the middle). “The crew stayed in tents that they themselves had to heat up and they slept in extremely harsh conditions, including sub-zero temperatures and snow,” Louhimies explains. “The idea was to make a real team of the actors and I believe that it shows in the final product.” The director emphasises the importance of making movies that audiences find meaningful in some way. To him  serves as a reminder of the consequences of war and honours the people that had to take part in battle against their will. “A crisis like this reflects on all of society and nobody that survives returns the same,” says Louhimies. “I hope this could help the viewer to understand the conflicts happening today and the resultant refugeeism.”  has made headlines as the biggest Finnish film production ever: the most expensive, the longest shoot and the largest crew. Only weeks after the premiere the movie was already the most viewed in Finland this year and since then it has been watched by 650 000 viewers, which is over 10 per cent of the country’s population. Now the film is commencing its march to international markets. “Distribution deals have already been signed with Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, England and Ireland – and more will probably come,” says Louhimies. As for the director himself, the future is open. Viewers can expect almost any genre of movie from him as his inspiration comes from “life itself”. But what is a certainty is that Louhimies is ready to experiment further outside of the small local industry. “I’m still in the beginning in my career and now it’s time to do my next film abroad since one could say that I have hit the ceiling in Finland – in a good way,” says Louhimies."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/designers-shape-tampere-vice-versa/,Designers shape Tampere – and vice versa,"Today, we’re visiting the Manchester of Finland, better known as Tampere. We take a peek into what’s happening in design and, quite literally, see what’s behind the scenes. Mira Vanttaja and Hanna Virkamäki created Uhana Design in 2012. Walking in central Tampere one can’t not notice the constant construction works everywhere. The town, after years of discussions, is finally in the process of getting its very own tramline. Those who’ve visited Tampere before but haven’t seen it for a fair few years will also spot a new underpass, a huge hotel tower and entrances to an underground parking hall, just below the main street Hämeenkatu. What’s going on?  , head of partnerships and networks at  , points out that there’s a rationale behind all the banging of hammers. Currently Tampere is the most popular domestic holiday destination for Finns, and according to a recent survey, a third of the country’s residents could imagine making the town their home. “We’re expecting the population to double by 2030,” Heino explains. “Already, 3.7 million people live within two hours from Tampere.” Essentially, Tampere wants to be ready to welcome everyone. Sometimes the preparations can come across funny for outsiders. “We’ve had visitors from abroad looking at the motorway junctions and asking when the ramps will be taken into use,” Heino says laughingly. “We’ve admitted that they’re already in use, despite the quietness.” Due to Tampere’s past as the home of a cotton factory, it’s known as ‘Manchester of Finland’ – or Manse, as Finns call it. Despite industry playing a huge role in the city’s history, not everything is made with hard tools. Tampere boasts a huge range of designers and design companies, many of which are internationally known. Heino believes that history and the omnipresence of nature have affected the local design scene. “People working in design have formed an active community,” she mentions. “The city really enables and encourages this.” Emilia Kiialainen knows the ins and outs of Tampere’s design scene. One of these community-builders is  , informally known as DoT.   runs the association and has lived in Tampere for 15 years. “Design is part of the urban culture here,” Kiialainen says. “There are various brands that have grown rapidly, and that has boosted the atmosphere in general. Designers don’t compete against each other, they collaborate.” Kiialainen also believes that being from the country’s “second city” isn’t a bad thing. It might even mean that it’s easier to follow one’s own path, as there aren’t as many influences around as in the crowded capital. “In a place like this you can make your designs really unique – and you also have to do so, in order to stand out.” One of the brands with plenty of buzz around it is  . Founders   and   run their cosy shop in central Tampere – but it’s a small miracle that there actually is something to sell. “Our problem, albeit a positive one, has been production,” Vanttaja says laughingly. “The demand we face is constantly increasing, but production lacks in capacity.” The brand was born in 2012, and especially Uhana’s Drop earrings have become a hit amongst fashionistas. Most of the manufacturing takes place near Tampere, but the growth has forced the entrepreneurs to look for ethical and eco-friendly producers from further away too. Once production catches up, Uhana is keen to gain a foothold abroad as well. Europe, South Korea and Japan are of particular interest. Home is and stays in Tampere. “Here designers are working and pushing forward together. No one’s hiding behind their sketchbook telling others to look away,” Vanttaja describes. Products are taking shape in the hands of Pihka’s Maisa Salonen. , founded back in 2003 by current owner   and fellow designers, is just a stone’s throw away from Uhana’s den. The brand embraces Tampere in all possible ways: sales manager   tells that everything with a Muka Va label on it has been made in the Tampere region. Due to its focus on ecological and ethical aspects, Saastamoinen believes that Muka Va will find more and more fans in central Europe, where consumers have a keen interest in sustainable high-quality clothing. At the moment, the brand has dozens of resellers in Finland and some around Europe. Across the rapid that runs through the centre of the town, there’s another shop with international plans in the back pocket. Or, in  ’s case, the bag. The brand makes leather shoes, bags and accessories. “Right now, Finnish demand is eating up most of our supply,”  , one of the founders, tells in the workshop-turned-into-store. “We’re definitely starting to map potential markets, particularly in the Nordic countries and Europe, and why not North America and Asia too.” In Pihka’s shop, visitors can actually see the products in the making. This is the case with   as well: jewellery-shoppers don’t only see the end-product, but the process itself. Vesa Peltonen from Korus puts the work in the (work)shop. Founder and owner   describes his style as “simplistic and Nordic”. “No American glamour,” he says and laughs. Funnily enough, a lot of Peltonen’s bespoke and custom-made pieces travel all the way to the US. He assumes it’s partly due to Etsy, an online shop particularly popular Stateside. Places like Etsy can be huge stepping stones for small brands that have no resources to run their own webstores. For Tampere brands,   has served as a trampoline to large markets. The site gathers together ethical design, and although the country of origin of the brand doesn’t matter, it all started from Tampere in 2013 as a project by its founders: CEO   and  , also known from  . “At the time, Anna was looking for a place to sell Papu’s collections,” Lusila explains. “She was hoping to find somewhere professional that would sell sustainable and responsible design.” The duo was left empty-handed, so they decided to get onto it on their own. Now, Weecos has almost 200 companies in its offering. Weecos CEO Hanna Lusila is fond of the city’s community spirit. Not just anyone can join the gang. Lusila notes that Weecos isn’t just a shop; it’s a lifestyle service that also aims to advocate for a fairer world both alone and with partners such as NGOs. “We don’t expect the companies to be perfect,” she emphasises. “But we do want them to be as good as they can and always make the best possible choices, be it in design, production, packaging or logistics.” So far, most of the orders come from Finland, but a growing number of international shoppers are finding their way to Weecos too. Currently the team is developing ways to streamline global sales in terms of secure payments and shipping. However, home is where the heart is. For Weecos, it’s Tampere, its lakes and its vibrant design community. “The communal spirit here is great,” Lusila says. “Small businesses really see the value of collaboration. If someone gets a slice of cake, the others don’t think it’s stolen from their plates; instead, we’re baking a big cake together that’s enough for everyone.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kuopio-lays-table-natural-goodies/,Kuopio lays the table with natural goodies,"In Kuopio, nature is never far away, making this capital of Lakeland an oasis of local produce, wild flavours and the good life. Let’s dive in to see what the soon-to-be European Region of Gastronomy has to offer! First things first: when visiting Kuopio, one should forget about the stereotype of Finns not talking to strangers. Here, everybody can enjoy a community feeling even when just running errands in the city. “If you go to the market square or the store you can’t avoid people starting to talk to you about almost any subject – or, for example, sharing their gingerbread recipe,” the marketing director at the City of Kuopio,  , says with a smile. Visitsavo.com offer real countryside experiences that combine culture and gastronomy. To her, curiosity as well as a certain future-mindedness is characteristic for the Savonians living here. The region in itself again has long traditions of agriculture, which combines with an urban city that brings together top-level education, vivid culture and tourism as well as globally recognised knowhow in wellness and health. The different areas all build on each other creating a positive snowball effect that has been called the “good life” of Kuopio. “Pure food, clean nature and fresh air are our trump cards – they are in some way ‘the Nokias’ of today and we now just have to share them with others as well,”  , company coordinator at ProAgria North Savo, explains. Thus, the region is a meeting point for the current trends of food origin and food safety. Local scientific expertise combines with a range of restaurants, enterprises and suppliers that build their businesses on what Finnish nature has to offer. Milk, berries and fish in particular have traditionally been a significant presence in the vast expanse of countryside that forms the Kuopio region. In fact, the majority of Finland’s milk production comes from here as well as a significant part of the country’s berry produce. Kuopio is especially known for their own kind of stuffed pies. This sweet version, mustikkakukko, features a rye crust and a blueberry filling. One of the successful names in the latter is  , whose expertise in freezing, storing and cleaning berries means that it is expanding to meet the rising demand of its service as Finland’s only enterprise solely focusing on refining others’ produce. “Our concept means that the customer doesn’t have to invest in any machines or equipment or storing facilities but they can completely focus on the sales,” says  , the CEO of Toripiha. Thanks to one of its biggest customers, an Estonian enterprise with customers in many countries, this Finnish company has taken the berry train to international markets. Also following this export wave is another type of refinement found in the opposite end of the Lakeland by the Lake Kallavesi. Here   is smoking fish for local and European markets. These companies, however, are far from alone in the Kuopio pond of gastronomic enterprises. “Strong traditions are characteristic for the food industry in the region, but there are also quite a lot of small companies with small gourmet style goodies,” describes business advisor at the City of Kuopio,  . The strength of these companies lies in gourmet products that create content for the regional food tourism. The close proximity of abundant fresh wild herbs spice up the local restaurants’ menus while other names include local breweries   and   – not to forget the local oldie but goldie  . This family company has been making naturally flavoured and coloured liqueur since before Finland’s independence in 1917. Already having opened some doors to the world, its success story also constitutes a great example for others to follow. Another company with a similar concept of refining Finnish nature with new forms is delicacy store  , which combines baking and cooking to make its handmade twists on traditional Finnish pastries and food. It all started with one woman sharing her cinnamon buns with the local crowd – now Liepuska is bringing Finnish traditions to international taste buds. The delicacies include the likes of Karelian pies, tartelettes filled with smoked salmon and cinnamon buns. Of course,   has a special place in Liepuska’s offering, as well as a sweet version of it, made from rye and blueberries. As a part of the current centennial celebrations, one of the humbler Finnish dishes, meat sauce, has also been brought to new life in a small tartelette that suits fine cocktail parties. “It couldn’t be more Finnish than this,” says the company’s CEO  . “In some sense, our aim is to bring these non-trendy flavours to high-end restaurants using our own solutions.” Today Liepuska’s fine dining catering food is distributed around the country as well as to London, where they are about to further expand thanks to a new partnership. Next up are the Nordic countries. “We want to make the export business profitable,” Turunen emphasises. “We wouldn’t want it to just be solely for Finnish markets.” Turunen also emphasises the importance of supporting local producers by always buying raw ingredients such as grains, berries and fish from them. By extension this could mean that berries picked by grandmas in North Savo eventually end up in a fine dining cocktail party in London. Thinking ahead, this is a scenario that might become increasingly common for the region’s companies thanks to its current gastronomic efforts. In November this year, the Kuopio region was named the   for 2020, giving its food, culture and tourism Europe-wide visibility. This is the first time any Finnish region takes part in this network. “The jury called us a pure pearl on the border of Europe and praised our products,” ProAgria’s Sares, who is heading the project, recalls. Iltalypsy is taking wild herbs to the next level with its new Willimaku products. As the project resembles the concept of the Culture Capital, the candidature means that the region is required to create new sustainable ways of doing things that go beyond the actual celebration year. This work has already started with, for example, creating new types of festivals that combine culture and gastronomic experiences. Now, Savonia University of Applied Sciences, ProAgria and the City of Kuopio are working together on how to further use the candidature to support small companies, innovations and the wider sector of culture and tourism. “We need to be goal-orientated in our support to help companies refine their products instead of exporting raw produce, since this increases the value in many ways,” says Sares. One example of this is helping companies to further brand their products. Case in point  , which has been encouraged to push ahead with its wild nature products creating the Willimaku (Wild Taste) brand. “We have found that people are really interested in these products and that is one of the reasons we decided to move forward with it,” entrepreneur   says. The family company’s main focus is actually in the restaurant business but now plans are afoot to expand the production of its marmalades and sparkling beverages built on uniquely Finnish tastes such as spruce, meadowsweet, willow herb and dandelion. Iltalypsy aims to eventually expand abroad even though there currently is much left to do on the domestic market. “We have sent samples to China, Spain and England and now we are going to a fair in Grunbach, Germany in January,” says Tikkanen. “We don’t yet have sales abroad but the samples are sent, so you never know what that will lead to.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vaasa-energy-capital-nordics/,Vaasa – The energy capital of the Nordics,"Today we pay a visit to the coastal city of Vaasa. Along the way, we learn why a third of Finland’s total energy technology exports come from the vibrant energy cluster here. Vaasa is one of those cities where a stroll across the market square or a drive down the main road is hard to complete without stumbling upon one or two friends, relatives or acquaintances. Home to almost 70 000 people, the humble face of the city belies an energetic core. In fact, one that has coined the label: the energy capital of the Nordics. These deep energetic roots can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century, when local resident   established what would become an extremely successful boat engine company under his own name. This business fuelled the development of the sector at large, and since then, the ball has been rolling at increased speed. “Today electrical and automation technology are huge in Vaasa,” says  , communication and brand manager of the energy cluster EnergyVaasa. “The Vaasa region is reponsible for almost all of the Finnish development in this sector.” Along with a cleantech boom that doubled employee numbers in the first decade of this century, the city is also making a name for itself as the perfect location for energy storage production. In fact, according to the   initiative it would be possible to start up large battery factory projects already  . Looking at the small population in the  , which is only two per cent of Finland’s total, it’s clear that the city hosts some of the most export-minded Finns. In March, the energy cluster’s most significant event,  , will bring together 4 100 energy business experts. “Today Vaasa expertise is found in the electrical grid in all countries in the world,” EnergyVaasa’s Alavillamo emphasises. The ongoing success of the EnergyVaasa cluster both locally and abroad is a result of different types of partnerships and joint programmes. “Within the cluster, the companies can be rivals in some areas but partners in others,” Alavillamo explains. The synergy includes companies and the school system and is visible in subcontractor deals, product and solution development as well as research. One such cooperation area is the forthcoming digitalisation of the energy sector, where   is providing smart solutions together with for example   and  . There Corporation’s scalable cloud-based home energy management platform is already optimising the energy use and costs in thousands of homes. Here home electricity heating or warm water boilers are controlled according to hourly electricity prices, making the homes an active part of the electricity market. However, this is only the beginning. “The digitalisation of the energy sector is still behind many other industries, but nonetheless it is transforming the use of energy and we are at the forefront of this change,” says  , CEO of There Corporation. “Together with distributed wind and solar power as well as IoT, our platform makes possible many types of consumer services that we cannot even foresee today.” There Corporation brings smart solutions to the energy sector. According to Saarenpää, the future lies in electricity demand management where not only the energy use of individual homes is optimised, but where the company’s technology allows a large number of homes to be aggregated and ultimately to share their electricity with others. “It is less expensive than building reserve power plants and saves electricity from the perspective of not only individual homes but also from that of the nation,” says Saarenpää. “It is sustainable development were consumers get compensated for sharing electricity – a bit like a virtual power plant.” There Corporation is still establishing itself in Finland, but as is the case for many of the companies in the region, it is only a matter of time before it goes international. The big players such as Wärtsilä, Danfoss and ABB are responsible for most of the local export but many small companies are subcontractors to the bigger companies and thus the synergy makes them part of the exports. The international growth of the region’s SMEs is also boosted by, for example,   and   in joint programme areas. One of these programmes is  , where cleantech sector business is promoted in crossborder co-operation with Swedish partners “VASEK and Merinova have been of huge help in spreading our message and getting to know the right contacts,” emphasises , the managing director at GeoPipe, a cleanthech company taking part in the programme. Robert Wentjärvi and Mauri Lieskoski have found a way to efficiently use naturally stored heat and thus decrease the use of oil.  focusses on utilising the heat and cold naturally stored in water, bedrock and sediment with new types of collectors. The innovation lies in a system where more heat or cold can be extracted with fewer costs and less work. The naturally extracted energy is used to heat up individual buildings, homes, summer cottages or distributed to the heating network. Even though electricity is needed to operate the system, two thirds of the energy come from the natural deposits. Thus, less eco-friendly oil heating methods can be decreased substantially, including on an international level. The company is currently operating in Finland and Sweden and now the plan is to expand to England where the possibilities and demand for its product is huge. “More than 15 per cent of the 66 000 gigawatt hours of energy required for heating in London could be extracted from the heat stored in the Thames,” says Wentjärvi. Vaasa’s international reach is also mirrored by global expertise coming to its shores. Dr. , a Swiss citizen who recently moved to Vaasa, is building the foundations for a globally significant focal point for the energy sector as the managing director of  . Krish Sankaran believes that the success of VEBIC’s projects will truly showcase the real potential of Vaasa, and Finland as a whole, on the innovation map of Europe. “As a someone coming from outside I see a lot of potential in this region which I am not seeing elsewhere in Finland and maybe not even in the Nordic countries,” says Sankaran. “This place has the potential to become the Mecca of energy innovation.” Sankaran envisions VEBIC to be a place that everyone within the energy business feels the need to visit and collaborate with at least once in a lifetime. To accomplish this the innovation centre is undertaking both applied and radical innovation research in a variety of fields. The innovation research will challenge the industry to think in new ways across a variety of areas. Here green solutions are high on the agenda and in one of the projects, the aim is to reduce environmental impact by converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. “Energy harvesting, energy storage and advanced fuels are a package in three steps – to get the energy, to store the energy and to convert energy,” says Sankaran. “In five years’ time, we might have a prototype or a concrete product.” Another special focus point for the innovation centre is addressing the wider socioeconomic picture. The aim is to create public-private partnerships to develop an efficient energy infrastructure. “We are for example looking at how to develop a functional, cost-efficient public transportation system for the city of Vaasa,” says Sankaran. According to Sankaran, the cooperation between different institutions in the region is a key to accomplish these goals. Here the intention is especially to create more synergy between the industry and education in the shape of internships and open house concepts. “We need more of those young minds coming in to the game because those are the biggest source of innovation,” says Sankaran."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rovaniemi-is-all-about-light/,Rovaniemi is all about light,"What’s with the rapidly increasing popularity of Lapland? One reason might be Finland’s big birthday; but there are plenty of other convincing explanations, too. Good News from Finland popped by to find out what the buzz is about in Rovaniemi. In Lapland, light is either everywhere or nowhere. In the summer, the sun doesn’t bother popping fully below the horizon, making blackout curtains a compulsory purchase for any light sleepers; in the winter, the dark sky provides the perfect stage for the Northern Lights, the dancing colours that paint the canvas of Lappish landscape. Visit Rovaniemi’s Sanna Kärkkäinen has seen the tourist industry boom across Lapland. The lights, or  , are one of the main attractions that draw tourists to the region’s capital Rovaniemi. “Clean nature and intriguing activities, too, but Northern Lights are by far the most sought-after thing,” says  , CEO of  . It’s no wonder. Although for Rovaniemi residents the lights are so commonplace that they might just give them an odd glance on a normal evening, only a fraction of the world’s population lives near the Arctic Circle. More and more people, particularly Asian travellers, are choosing Finnish Lapland as their tourist destination. It must be partially due to the region’s beauty, but some credit must be given to Finnair’s increasing   and   (not least with  ) as well as the good word Finland has received from travel bibles such as   and  . Rovaniemi is still not quite Rome or Paris, but that’s not even the point. It’s a go-to destination for those who have already been everywhere and want to experience something different. “This recent growth has been unprecedented in Lapland,” Kärkkäinen notes. “However, as Finland isn’t cheap, there’s no mass tourism. The echo of exclusivity adds to the value and quality we can offer.” One thing that has changed the tourism industry is the growing number of unique accommodation options. Rovaniemi and its surrounding areas boast igloos, treehouses and five-star hotels that have become global hits through social media and international travel articles. “I regularly answer phone calls from people telling me they’ve seen a photo of an incredible hotel online and want to find it,” Kärkkäinen tells. “Five years ago, this didn’t happen.” The one-off investments have been huge, but they’re paying off.  , owner of  , has just finished polishing one of the newest accommodation options: hut-shaped cottages with a glass ceiling. Despite only being on the brink of finishing construction, the first month is pretty fully booked. Arctic Treehouse Hotel is a fancy treehouse with a view, and if you’re lucky, you’ll get some Northern Lights too. “At least we can say we’ve got excellent illustrations,” he says and grins. Another success story can be heard from  , one of the owners of  , which has been operating since November last year. After opening the doors to the ‘treehouses’, equipped with a huge window overlooking trees and the sky, its views have been featured in international media articles and social media all over the globe. “We wanted to do something different, not copy anyone else,” Länkinen notes. “It’s very common to have architects and construction professionals visit and tell us they’ve chosen to travel to Rovaniemi only because of Arctic Treehouse Hotel.” It’s not just the scenery that sets the treehouses apart from the crowd. According to Länkinen, the hotel wants to maintain a level of service quality so high that every single detail is taken into account. “When a customer asks us to jump, we don’t ask how high – we ask when we can come down,” he says laughingly. He sounds a lot like  , the director or  , listed as Finland’s best hotel in 2017  . The centrally located hotel opened in 2015 after extensive works had been conducted in the protected building that previously comprised flats. Arctic Light Hotel is full of well-thought details. Pictured is Timo Kärki. “We mapped every single detail and marked them as protected, as we saw how valuable the history can be, also commercially,” Kärki explains. “It was a lot of work, of course, as we couldn’t just draw a room and repeat it – we had to do the planning 54 times for our 54 rooms.” Arctic Light also attracts visitors who travel to Rovaniemi exclusively to stay in the hotel. Not all of them want to jump on a snowmobile or be drawn around by huskies. “Some people search for activities and ride the storm, but we’re looking into developing   for those who don’t,” Kärki tells. “A lot of of guests are looking for relaxation, peace and quiet.” Despite some wanting to downshift, others can’t get enough of speed and adventure. There’s plenty of that in Rovaniemi, and one of the most popular to-do list items is a husky ride.   co-owner   is walking around the area that will soon be “the best kennel in Finland”. “But hopefully not for long,” Beets says, surprisingly, with the dogs barking in the background in excitement. “We hope someone will then build an even better one. This is a challenge to my colleagues: if I can do it, you can do it, too.” The Dutchman and his wife   take tourists of all ages on husky rides across the beautiful landscape of Lapland. The new premise is yet unfinished, but once completed, it’ll be top-notch for customers and employees – and most importantly, dogs. Valentijn Beets runs Bearhill Husky, but the dogs steal the show. As usual. “We take animal care very seriously, as it’s the foundation of the business,” Beets points out. According to Beets, the bookings are up in every possible way, and the same goes to other dog safari organisers. Particularly individual travellers are a growing customer group, and it can be seen across the industry. Whatever travellers choose to do, these days the   of the location is a factor. The hotels and huskies definitely are worth a shot (pun intended), but getting a proper photo of Northern Lights is a challenging task. This is why   was founded. Co-founder   and his colleagues take tourists as far as feasible in their pursuit of the otherworldly phenomenon. They don’t promise Northern Lights for sure – they wouldn’t be half as magical if they chould be switched on with a click of a button – but as the photography expeditions are only for small groups, it’s easy enough to drive the literal extra mile, or 100, if needs be. “Our goal is that all participant swill learn something new during the tour,” Uutela tells. “It can be about Lapland, Northern Lights, photography or the culture here.” Beyond Arctic has photography tours both at night and in the daytime. The landscapes are like from the prettiest postcards, and not only in Rovaniemi: Uutela’s plan is to expand across all Nordic countries. “We want to become the leading photography tour provider in the region,” he says. One of Rovaniemi’s all-year attractions is Santa Claus himself: he greets tourists 365 days a year. Beyond Arctic also wants to introduce the Arctic summers to outdoors enthusiasts. Next June, Uutela is hoping to help people shoot video and film of the sun just touching the horizon and then popping back up again. Indeed, the next big challenge for Rovaniemi – and the whole of Lapland, for that matter – is to extend the season, preferably having steady flow of visitors all year round. Visit Rovaniemi’s Sanna Kärkkäinen says there’s a need to define the main draws for summer time. For some reason, the magnificent Midnight Sun hasn’t been a global hit in the past years. “There are now signs of Asian travel agencies waking up to the Lappish summertime,” Kärkkäinen says. “It lets people switch day to night and night to day, if they want to try out living like locals!”"

Here you go, our augmented 2D report from Slush day one. The conference kicked off with former US vice president Al Gore addressing the audience – which was abundant. “My purpose is to recruit you to be part of the solution to the climate crisis,” he said. No doubt most of Slush was already on board. Varjo’s ‘human eye-resolution’ VR technology was tested in public for the first time in history, and the people given that honour were nothing less than royals. Just before Prince Daniel from Sweden (pictured), Britain’s Prince William had a go at the headset. Varjo CMO Jussi Mäkinen (left) kept his cool under pretty extreme circumstances: dealing with the two princes. “This technology is the best in the world, so it deserves the best possible start,” Mäkinen says. Investors, partners, companies, employers, employees… You name it. Slush is about pitching and finding the right connections who happen to share the same passion. All the buzz making you feel nauseous? Finnish Naava’s smart green wall helps Slush-visitors find some fresh air. Can you spot the squirrel? Lauri Luotola (left) and Noora Kykkänen from Kaiku Health tell that the company is attending Slush particularly to attract new team members. Kaiku Health has doubled its workforce in 12 months, and next year they want to grow from 20 to 40. “Here’s where we find brilliant coders and big data experts.” Framery just recently bagged The Internationalisation Awards of the President of the Republic, and now the firm provides Slush attendees with quiet spaces for meetings and interviews. “We’ve got almost 70 booths here for two days, so it’s a big deal for our brand awareness,” marketing manager Martina Santanen notes. Slush owes a lot to its volunteers. Kaisa Kuitunen and Aava Harju work at the cloakroom and the coffee and water station as part of their school course. Their studies at a Helsinki Upper Secondary School focus on international business. “We’re learning a lot here and seeing all sorts of relevant things,” they say."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kotka-s-games-industry-wings/,Kotka’s games industry has wings,"Today, we pay a visit to the south-east of the country, to discover a vibrant hub of game play and development in a city renowned for its shipping, logistics and paper expertise. The word   in Finnish means ‘eagle’. Yet for the city located some 130 kilometres east of Helsinki that shares the same name, it has been water – not wings – that has traditionally played a significant role in sharing the fruits of the local economy with the world. Kotka is home to the biggest universal port in Finland, the Port of HaminaKotka, where timber, paper, metal and stone are transported as far as Central Asia and China. Recent years have seen the city diversifying its offering abroad. Case in point is the games industry, with over 90 per cent of its turnover attributable to export. This is the result of a lot of hard work – and hard-headedness. “Our vision is to make the Kotka-Hamina region the best place in the world to develop games,” states Teemu Saarelainen. “We kept betting on the IT industry even when the IT bubble had just burst late last century,” recalls  , the head of games at  , the Kotka-Hamina regional development organisation. “A few IT companies were born, with the pioneers of the games industry eventually coming from here. In retrospect, it was a great decision – without it there’d be no local game industry.” Today, Cursor is home to  , a network of around 15 studios that share a common, lofty goal. “Our vision is to make the Kotka-Hamina region the best place in the world to develop games,” Saarelainen states. “We have all the pieces of the puzzle: education is growing, so too the number of games studios.” However, 10 years ago this was merely a dream yet to materialise. It was then that the local games industry got its first break. Kotka’s maritime museum commissioned an EU-funded multimedia project, which saw young developers bringing the Battle of Svensksund to life: a massive naval battle Russia and Sweden fought in Kotka’s waters in July 1790. Game developers reproduced the encounter virtually, creating 3D models of Kotka’s islands, the sea and the battling ships. Sensing an opportunity, Cursor was a driving force behind the development, helping fund its operations. The event galvanised the budding industry. Among those participating was  , CEO of Kotka’s first games studio,  . The studio’s debut title,  , would too involve seafaring. Released in 2009, the game would go on to sell around 300 000 copies. In an era when games were packaged in boxes and carried a 50-euro price tag, Kotka’s fledgling industry had its first bona fide success. Things have moved quickly for Nitro Games in recent times: the studio has closed two successful funding rounds this year, which gleaned 5.3 million euros for the company in total. The studio was listed on NASDAQ First North Stockholm back in June, and is now publishing its games without the help of an intermediary across Europe and America. Playa – Game Industry Hub is helping to break the ice internationally for the local games community. “We have a lot of fun here,” Tähtinen says. “If you’re a games developer, now would be the perfect time to get in touch.” Nitro Games’ competitive edge comes from harnessing the NG Platform to produce high-quality mobile content with 360 visuals to timescales that others would find impossible or exorbitantly expensive. This has fuelled the creation of   and  , the latter of which   upon its release. Hollywood has also sat up and taken notice. In June 2016, the studio delivered a game for Fox’s   movie, on the back of this technology. Whilst the company has also carved out a base in Helsinki as its momentum grows, its headquarters remain in the seaside town of 55 000 residents. “I don’t think there are that many people out there on the streets of Kotka who realise this place produces games that are played by millions of people, from China to the Americas,” states Tähtinen. A sculpture of two eagles rises above Kotka’s seafront promenade, and at first glance it looks as if they’re fighting. In fact, it’s a perfectly friendly scene: one has caught a fish, perhaps even thanks to the other’s help. The same could be said about the two big fish in Kotka’s games scene. Seemingly in competition, Nitro Games and   are actually on excellent terms. “The Finnish scene is small and friendly: companies aren’t competing against each other for anything except maybe skilled labour, of which there’s a perpetual shortage,” Kukouri’s CEO   explains. Kukouri has attracted significant attention globally, with its series   downloaded over 25 million times on mobile platforms. Soares himself is a recognised figure on the local streets, given that he’s been involved in local politics for a decade (“as if I wasn’t busy enough already”). But this is nothing compared to the commotion when he enters Kukouri’s latest release  , a mobile game where players create worlds and trade with each other. Here, Soares is instantly recognised as a developer thanks to his character’s purple name; players start approaching him for selfies or just to shoot the breeze. Real-life social media influencers get their own customised character in Pixel Worlds and can even project their YouTube videos to players. “We’ve taken the social interaction elements of gaming to the next level,” he elaborates. “  crosses into the real world through social media.” Kukouri’s latest offering already has significant wind in its sails. Players have posted about the game or their characters tens of thousands of times on various social media channels, with many characters having their own accounts real people can follow. “For many of our players   is not just a game,” Soares observes. “It’s a community, a place to make new friends from all over the planet.” Whilst Kotka’s games scene is reaching foreign shores in increasing numbers, there is also considerable traffic coming in the opposite direction. Paraguayan games studio Posibillian Tech is currently working in Kotka, thanks to Cursor’s Levelup Startup Accelerator. “They’ve received really good mentoring and have been involved with many local games companies,” Cursor’s Saarelainen states. “It’s been a very positive experience for all. There’s more diversity here and we are also making new contacts abroad.” For newcomers, another path to Finland is through education. XAMK, the South-Eastern University of Applied Sciences, is proving to be a key source of game development talent for the region. Both the Kotka and Kouvola campuses have numerous international students and offer studies in English – the former focusing strongly on game programming and the latter on game design – thus complementing each other nicely. “There is a good connection between the education institution and games companies,” Saarelainen comments. “We have a very bright future ahead.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tales-trees-rooted-net-positivity/,Tales by Trees is rooted in net positivity,"Often not buying anything is deemed the eco-friendliest consumer choice. Tales by Trees wants to create products that do good instead of nothing. Art and design, net positivity and Nordic forests. These three elements embody the essence of  . “Every consumer choice has an impact,” founder and owner   says. “Most of the time, buying something means that natural resources are being used. Buying nothing would mean that nothing happens.” Net positivity,   by authors and Tales by Trees’ advisors   and  , challenges traditional ways of looking at corporate social responsibility. Instead of being less bad, companies can switch their focus to actually bettering things. Tales by Trees leads by example. When buying one of its products, customers can be confident that the resources that went into the production process, like materials, logistics, transport and the rest of it, will be generously compensated. The company’s products are made of wood, so in order to deliver its promise of net positivity, it looks at the wellbeing of forests in order to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. Using a custom-made ecological foot- and handprint calculator, Tales by Trees protects forests in Finland and plants trees in Africa through its partnerships with charitable organisations. Markus Pyhältö Pyhältö emphasises that it’s not just about giving back what you’ve taken. Tales by Trees counts the real environmental impact and then splashes a big extra on top. Whatever exceptional happens in the production chain, the effect always remains on the plus side for the environment. The trees’ tale dates back to 2012. One of the company’s artists,  , happened to email Pyhältö about something totally unrelated, and just added a story he’d created to entertain his children on long train journeys to visit their grandmother. The story really spoke to Pyhältö. “I’ve read all kinds of texts in my life, and I can’t really explain what was so captivating about the    ,” he notes. “But it did stop me in my tracks and left me thinking.” Now, Tales by Trees has published a series of three books. Pyhältö describes them as philosophical contemplations for adults, but in the form of illustrated children’s books. The stories were the driving force for what is now known as the Tales by Trees’ concept. Buying the book, people receive not only the story, but also the notion that whatever went into the book’s existence has been paid back. On top of the book trilogy, Tales by Trees has a design item called The Seed. According to Pyhältö, both products remove 30–50 times the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from their material extraction to end-of-life, and also protect 20–30 times the natural resources that were used. In the future, the range will include high-quality design that draws inspiration from Nordic forests, be they made of wood composite or wood-based textiles. Pyhältö points out that the current level of consumption is not sustainable. The Seed is set to change that. Pyhältö is aware that there are industries in which net positivity remains a pipe dream. However, he sees the direction as a huge opportunity for Finnish forestry and biotechnology, as wood-based alternatives to plastic and fabric are of growing interest – and Finland has all the skills. He also points out that one of the principles of net positive business is that it’s not possible to plant trees to make up for the damage caused by using oil-based materials, for example. “That’s greenwashing,” he points out. “You can’t harm something somewhere and then do good elsewhere and call yourself okay.” Pyhältö also accentuates that Tales by Trees is not competing with environmental organisations and charities. It’s a commercial company with turnovers and revenues to keep an eye on. And it sells. Tales by Trees’ recent Indiegogo campaign received orders from over 20 countries, and the vast majority of customers hails from the US. Pyhältö hopes that Tales by Trees’ example attracts other companies to adopt more net positive approaches. “We now act as the messenger,” he tells. “I don’t see that other net positive companies would compete with us at all. Having more firms and people on board would just help spread the word – and the good for us and future generations.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-travel-industry/,Five for Friday: Travel industry,"The Finnish travel industry continues to bloom, fuelled by strong actors offering high quality, efficient and innovative experiences to both business and leisure travellers. As  , the leading travel fair in Northern Europe was recently held in Helsinki. Our very own   hosted a media tour alongside the event, where foreign journalists learned about various Finnish travel solutions, together with fresh lifestyle innovations. And so, here are five companies that are there for you, whenever you are heading abroad – especially to Finland. This up-and-coming company focusses on temporary accommodation solutions and relocation services for businesses and individual travellers. Now, after  , the company is aiming even higher. “By the end of 2020, our ambitious goal is to be the leading accommodation service provider in Northern Europe,” sales manager reveals. Having carved out a significant niche in the market by offering the shortest flights between Europe and Asia, Finland’s national carrier has reached the big time! The company has announced  , as well as a co-operation with Deutsche Bahn. The company was also the first airline in Europe  . “We have been building Helsinki as a hub between Asia and Europe for some 20 years already,” states director of media relations,  . “At the moment, we are going through the fastest growth phase in our history.” Finland’s leading general port for international cargo traffic has also grown into  . With its new West Terminal 2, Port of Helsinki has responded to growing demand by significantly increasing its capacity, as frequent ship connections make it possible for Helsinki and Tallinn to operate as twin cities. “When it comes to growth, we find co-operation between ports more fruitful than competition,” director of communications   explains. “Also, check-in is more automated than ever, as traffic needs to go smoothly.” This blue chip company is a group of individual Finnish hotels that promote luxury and lifestyle. These include the lion’s share of the most reputable hotels and restaurants in Helsinki. “This is an interaction business,” says    , business and creative director of Hotel St. George. “It is not a question of accommodations, it is all about experiences.” Part of the charm of visiting Finland is marvelling at the world-renowned design, be it architecture, clothing or items around the home. Visitors can also take their own piece of Finnishness back home with them, thanks to this one-stop shop that is the world’s largest retailer of Finnish design, with 300 brands in stock. “We are now expanding overseas with the intention of promoting Finnish lifestyle with local producers,” tells chief financial officer . “Our subsidiaries, such as in South Korea, reflect our values, which are good design, beauty, sustainability and transparency."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/neverthink-believes-distraction-demand/,Neverthink believes in distraction on demand,"While content might be king, the choice not to choose it yourself has proven to be just as popular. For the founders of Neverthink, the need for a background companion has turned a simple idea into a global success. In an era of video on demand, where favourite series and movies are never more than a few clicks away, a rapidly growing Finnish startup claims the App Store has a gap for a completely opposite type of service. Instead of focusing on content,   believes in the power of the experience itself. “If you want to watch a specific video you go to YouTube, and if you want to watch movies you go to HBO or Netflix,”  , CEO of the company, explains, “but if you just want instant hands-free entertainment while eating, while doing exercise or just chilling – then you go to Neverthink.” The idea is simple: a library of channels offering an auto play of videos that can be switched on or off – no skip buttons involved. Does it sound familiar? Yes, what Junno and co-founder   created, without realising it at the time, was actually a new type of linear TV. The content of the TV channels is not chosen based on algorithms but by a team of curators that together watch 3 500 videos every day. Every channel has a specific person behind it that is passionate about certain content in particular. “In a way, it gives you the option to see the Internet through someone else’s eyes,” says Junno. “You get to discover a lot of things that you would otherwise never see.” Neverthink’s mission is not to replace original TV content, but to bring the TV experience to the viewing of online videos and make it available on all your screens. In the beginning, Neverthink was, and in some ways still is, just a fun project between two friends. About a year ago, Junno realised he missed the experience of coming home and switching on the TV as a way to clear the mind after a long day. All videos are chosen by humans – there are 21 people currently in the team and the mission is to have hundreds of curators. “We just tell them to curate whatever they like to watch,” says CEO Aviv Junno. “I met up with Claus and told him that wouldn’t it be cool if it were possible to watch YouTube and Reddit like watching TV,” Junno remembers. The idea quickly took root and the first product was created in the summer of 2016. Back then, the mobile app was basically just an auto play feed of videos. It never occurred to Junno that they had a potential company on their hands. Nevertheless, soon it was number one on Product Hunt and   had fallen in love with the idea, investing 100 000 euros in it. The business was born. Only months later, the startup closed a 1.4 million-US dollar round led by venture capital firm   and  , which saw the the company valued at 10 million US dollars. Then, in October 2017, the app was launched globally on iOS and Apple TV, which saw it explode on the market. “Two weeks in we already had 2.5 million video views and users from over 194 countries,” Junno enthuses. Today, Neverthink has been featured on top of the App Store’s front page in every major market and the rapidly growing company plans to open an office in the US. But first, it is all about perfecting the product. “We are doing a really big update, which is going to be almost a totally new Neverthink, upgraded on every level – visually, experience, everything,” Junno says. Some of the biggest changes, coming out during the first quarter of 2018, will be the addition of Chromecast and making the app compatible with different screens. The upgrade also means that the channels will be updated in real time instead of every 24 hours. As the company continues to get requests from interested brands and partners it can already see how the product could be monetised. With the likes of sponsored channels potentially in the pipeline, it is setting the bar high for the future. “The vision is to sit on every platform next to Netflix, Twitch and HBO,” Junno says. “Since Spotify makes Sweden known for music, I want Neverthink to make Finland known for videos.” The upcoming visual upgrade will literally turn the phone into “a remote for the Internet”."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vilkas-webshop-plug-play-solution/,Vilkas webshop is a plug and play solution,"One-person businesses tend to be up to their eyes with work even without coding and hosting their own online store. Tampere-based Vilkas wants to give them a digital hand. Back in the early days of digitalisation, setting up an online store used to be a chore. That didn’t stop  , the now-CEO of  , from believing in their eventual rise and shine. Too bad he was a little early in his predictions. “We [himself and now-VP development  ] were a little disillusioned in the late ‘90s, thinking that hundreds of companies will be establishing their webstores within a couple of years,” he recalls. “That surely didn’t happen: instead, we found ourselves explaining to business owners what the Internet  .” Plenty of things have changed since then, not only in the names and ownerships of companies Korkiakoski has been running (as well as the general awareness of the possibilities of the Internet), but also in digital technology. Vilkas brought a plug and play webshop solution to market in 2005, the same year the company’s current name was established. No Caption The service means that any enterprise can open its own online store instantly just by creating an account and logging in. “It’s a do-it-yourself platform that’s as easy to use and navigate as possible,” Korkiakoski explains. “With it, business owners don’t need the skills or the technology to create a global webshop from scratch.” Although ahead of their time, the basic pillars Korkiakoski and his partners defined in their strategy and vision two decades ago still apply – as do the basic features and functionalities expected from a webshop. Hence, Vilkas is able to serve all kinds of businesses, as long as they’ve got a product or a service to sell. The range of stuff and services on Vilkas’ platform is a cross-section of Finnish enterprises, ranging from micro to stock companies. A typical customer, in Korkiakoski’s words, is “a man with a van”. Vilkas targets even the smallest of firms with its reasonable pricing and ongoing support. Whilst some online store platform providers aim to serve big corporations, Vilkas’ eyes are on the masses – and long-term relationships, maintained by constantly developing the service and making all aspects of online retail, including shipping and payments, as easy and straightforward as possible. “Large retailers can offer resource-intensive projects, but they only ever last a specific period of time,” Korkiakoski notes. “Our approach enables us to develop our product continuously and helps us employ staff permanently.” At the moment, Vilkas is a team of 20 people, divided into two teams. The growth is steady and sustainable in terms of both team members and new customers. “Annually, we help open about 400 new webshops,” Korkiakoski counts. “As some always shut down, too, the net increase tends to be somewhere between 200 and 300.” At the moment, Vilkas serves companies in Sweden, and in the future Norway and Denmark will have their own customised versions of the service. The localisation includes employing a native speaker to support clients in their own language as well as finding local partners for payments and shipping. International operations benefit existing customers, too. With the growing network of service providers, Finnish companies can easily make their webstores more accessible to other Nordic markets without having to separately negotiate logistics contracts and integrate payment solutions. The same goes for Swedish companies wanting to reach out to Finnish consumers. In the future, Vilkas might be tapping markets further away from its back yard. Even if it doesn’t offer the service in all possible languages, it can provide any foreign company a route to the Nordic online sales environment. “Online shopping has changed sales remarkably, as selling has gone from local to global,” Korkiakoski notes. “The SME sector is no exception.” Vilkas’ international team is based in Tampere."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tornion-panimo-s-future-is-as-good-as-gold/,Tornion Panimo’s future is as good as gold,"Beer from northern Finland is going back to its roots, thanks to this microbrewery. Depending on your love of greens and fairways, the northern Finnish border town of Tornio might be familiar for the fact that it shares a golf course with Haparanda in neighbouring Sweden. Here, not only can golfers tee off between countries, they can also drive a ball across time zones. However, if your passion is more of the fermented beverage variety, perhaps you might know that Tornio has a long history of brewing beer. Back in 1873, Tornio was a gateway to the rivers heading north. Surrounded by barley fields, this made it a fine location for a brewery in the eyes of local merchants. The original Tornion Panimo was founded that year and became renowned for producing one of Finland’s most popular beers, Lapin Kulta (Lapland’s gold), for over a century. However, the story seemingly came to an end seven years ago, when owners Heineken moved production to the south of Finland. The city was left with a sizeable hop-less hole. A beer for all seasons. All was not lost. After the demolition of the empty 22 000 m  industrial complex went up for tender, one of the contractors offered to buy the site, as well as dismantle the brewing complex, with the hope of developing the area as a leisure and cultural nexus. “I stepped in to run that project and suggested that, given we’re standing on 140 years of brewing history here, wouldn’t it make sense to go ahead and get a brewery up and running,” remembers  , CEO of  . From this spark of inspiration, the microbrewery was born in 2016. All that was needed now was a recipe to make the perfect beer. Enter: the man who created the classic Lapin Kulta taste in 1964, master brewer  . Whilst Andelin had retired in 1999, he felt strongly about not letting Tornio’s brewing legacy fizzle out. Fortunately, beer recipes can’t be patented, they’re simply kept secret. Thus, the original beer recipe was easy to come by, scrawled as it was in his notebook from back in the day. Nonetheless, an origin story isn’t complete without some twists an turns. Whilst the recipe was in hand, it quickly dawned on the entrepreneurs that the yeast needed wasn’t available in Finland. Given how important yeast is to the end result, it was looking like Andelin’s pride and joy would not grace the new microbrewery’s selection. But Andelin had studied to become a master brewer in Berlin and still remembered where he’d found the yeast over 60 years ago. “He kept sending emails to Germany and we thought surely this is a fool’s errand,” remembers Kostiander. Persistence paid off – the yeast was found. “That was a fine moment,” says Kostiander. “It dawned on us that we really could make that original recipe,” . Now, the ‘Original 1964′ is joined by the rest of ‘Tornion Panimo’s offering, which includes an Artic stout, apale ale, a Czech-style pilsner and a North Arctic lager. Tornion Panimo is also finalising the build of a gin and rum distillery, utilising the cellar vaults under the brewery. This will soon make it the northernmost rum producers in the world. The brewery is also looking for the right partners to help it take its beers to international markets. The world is also coming to the brewery, too. Tornion Panimo has already organised tours and tastings as well as corporate events for visitors from Israel, Japan, China and the Nordics. Could it be that ,any are cottoning on that this could be the perfect companion for the 19th hole of golf across borders, perhaps? Tornion Panimo produces an Artic stout, pale ale, the ‘Original 1964 Lager’, a Czech-style pilsner and a North Arctic lager."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-alcoholic-beverages/,Five for Friday: Alcoholic beverages,"These Finnish producers are pioneering a push towards uncharted alcoholic waters. The news this week that microbrewery   to gin and rum reminded us that a lot has happened since we gathered together five Finnish   and   – not to mention  . And so, behold another five examples of fine Finnish flavours. Looking for some beverage inspiration? Look no further than One Eyed Spirits, whose idea is to add that little something to spice up a drink’s brand. Tom of Finland-themed vodka and Ron de Jeremy are but some of what’s on offer. “Our goal is that within the next few years, we’ll have a small but intriguing portfolio of spirits,” Hietalahti  . “We’re always open to interesting ideas and collaborations.” Interest globally is set to be piqued even more, after Ron de Jeremy was recently named one of the top 10 trending rums in the world by  . Starting out as restaurant back in the mid-1990s, before successfully commencing brewing a range of tasty beers, this Finnish institution has also started producing its own gin. “We knowingly aim for the international market,”  . “The interest in microbreweries has been growing for a while now, and the same is happening with micro distilleries, so we’re confident there’s room for us in the market.” After stumbling across a recipe that combined Finnish mulled wine   and sparkling wine,   and   decided to spice up their evening shindig with friends by raising this different kind of toast. The idea for a ready-made combo was born. “Glöet blends Finnish design and innovation with Spanish tradition and skills in wine making,” Anette  . Not content with conjuring up a drink for the cosy months, Glöet has also added Glöet White, a sunny blend of cava and sangria, to the mix. This factory-size boutique distillery owns some of the most exciting brands breaking through on the luxury alcohol scene, including Laplandia vodka. The special ingredient? “The UN rates Finland’s drinking water among the best in the world, and our water in Tyrnävä is particularly clean even by Finnish standards,”  , CEO and partner  . “Hence one could argue our vodka is made from one of the cleanest water sources in the whole world.” When does a hobby become a business? When it involves the introduction of flavoursome wine varieties to a thirsty clientele. Raspberry, cloudberry, bilberry – even beetroot – are bottled in new ways, offering yet another display of originality from up north. “We are putting Finland on the world map of wine,”   last May. “We believe we have something special.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/diske-wants-put-personal-health-assistant-pocket/,Diske wants to put a personal health assistant in your pocket,"This Finnish company is creating a pioneering AI that will provide its users with science-based and personalised lifestyle guidance. AI. Big data. Machine learning. Technologies and concepts that contain the power to renew and remodel seemingly any industry – including wellness. So at least believes  , a Finnish company that is using these tools to build a novel approach to personal health and wellbeing. The firm is creating an advanced AI that promises to offer highly effective wellness advice to each user individually. At the core of the AI is data from authoritative sources such as clinical research and national dietary guidelines. But rather than relying solely on third-party data, the software will also take into account feedback from individual users regarding their subjective experience on their wellbeing. Thanks to this, each user will receive advice that is personalised to them specifically. In other words, Diske is aiming to build a service that is far more comprehensive and personalised than what exists in the current market of health-focused apps and chatbots. The company’s AI goes by the name of Bono. “Because we combine general and personal data, our AI will be able to give suggestions that reflect each user’s own preferences and experiences,” says  , founder and CEO of Diske. “At the moment, most healthtech products rely on simple predetermined models, whereas our AI can dynamically analyse data and offer recommendations even as situations change.” And this, Kettunen says, is the key in helping people make a lasting lifestyle change. Kettunen points to professional personal trainers, who tweak their dietary and exercise programs practically for every client. “There is no universal model that works equally well for everyone,” he says. “If users receive advice that takes into account their own preferences, this will support their own experience of wellbeing and will further help them stick to the recommendations.” So far Diske’s main focus has been on building its AI – called Bono – which is based on what Kettunen calls a “modular neural network”. This serves as a foundation, upon which the company will be able to build many kinds of services in the future. Ultimately Diske aims to create a virtual health assistant that is always with the user – think of a Tamagotchi-style mobile app that collects data about your daily activities and gives advice on how you could improve your wellness. 2018 promises to be a big year for Diske, which was founded in 2014 and currently has a couple of employees in addition to Kettunen. After a long development period, which included pilots and other collaborations with several partners including Fazer and HUS (the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa), Diske is preparing to roll out products for both health professionals and consumers later this year. The consumer app will also be made available internationally, and the company is hoping to capture a large part of the growing industry of personal wellbeing, thanks to the unique solution it will introduce to the global market. Diske’s ambitions, however, go beyond business success “Hopefully we will contribute to the improvement of public health generally, and help prevent so-called diseases of affluence like obesity,” Kettunen says. “I also hope our products will improve health awareness generally, and empower people in making their own choices when it comes to personal wellbeing.” CEO and founder Timo Kettunen"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-innovation-makes-veggie-growth-greener/,Finnish innovation makes veggie growth greener,"Air, light, nutrients and water are the typical ingredients for growing happy vegetables. Soon living moss could be part of the mix, thanks to a new sustainable and resource-saving growing media developed in Finland.  Vegetable farming conjures an image of vast fields of plum tomatoes and green cucumbers. In reality, a lot of our vegetables today are grown in greenhouses using hydroponic (soil free) farming. This often means using a stone-based material, known as stonewool, as the growing media (the industry term for plant growth materials). While good for growth, stonewool can be water-thirsty and difficult to recycle. Now, established Finnish substrate manufacturer   (part of  ) has turned to living sphagnum moss to give farmers a more sustainable alternative, which it calls Mosswool. “You can water our Mosswool slabs less because moss retains water very efficiently,” explains  , technology expert at Novarbo. “This saves water and means fewer costs for the farmer. After use, stonewool should be taken to a recycling plant where the stones and organic material are mechanically separated. However, Mosswool can be put directly into the farmer’s own compost with other crop residues.” Novarbo’s Mosswool slab provides an efficient and sustainable substrate for various vegetables. The slabs are made of sphagnum moss, are fully recyclable by composting and need less frequent watering than currently commonly used growing media. Mosswool hasn’t blossomed overnight. Novarbo started researching sustainable, moss-based growing media already 10 years ago, but couldn’t find an ecological method for collecting moss from bogs. This was changed by EcoMoss, a Finnish company founded in 2013 and now also part of Biolan Group, a few years ago. Its patented technique harvests only a part of the living moss and leaves enough pores for the moss to regrow entirely within a few years. “Sphagnum moss is a rapidly renewable raw material,” Konttinen says. “EcoMoss has built the machinery for collecting the moss and simultaneously we have developed the method for transforming it into slab form. Now Mosswool is approaching commercial launch. Novarbo has already delivered small quantities of Mosswool to selected pilot customers and aims to have the first production plant up and running by the end of 2018. “We already have a long queue of customers wanting to try the product,” Konttinen enthuses. “Our first aim is to bring Mosswool slabs to the market as soon as possible, so all our interested customers can move some of their crops to this new growing medium.” Biolan Group has the experience to follow up its ambitious expansion plans. It has developed substrates, organic fertilisers and greenhouse technology for professional farmers since the 1970s, first within the Finnish gardening and farming company Biolan Group and after 2010 also at its subsidiary Novarbo. Today Biolan Group has two factories, in Finland and Estonia, and exports 80 per cent of its products overseas to over 60 countries. “The growing media market is rapidly expanding globally,” Konttinen says. “The main market obviously will be in Europe at the beginning, but obviously market and demand is high in the heavilly populated Asia.” “Mosswool has been developed as sustainable alternative for vegetable cultivation,” says Novarbo’s Petri Konttinen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/millennial-board-finds-new-questions-old-answers/,Millennial Board finds new questions to old answers,"As times change, even the most traditional businesses need to adopt their ways of existing to stay relevant. Millennial Board brings along the views of the most talked-about demographic. If you haven’t heard the word ‘millennial’, you were probably born yesterday – and, most likely, to millennial parents. Millennials are today’s 20- to 35-year-olds, the folks that approach life sometimes with vastly different values and expectations to those of their predecessors, particularly when it comes to things such as ownership and status. Many of the parents of millennials are now decision-makers and senior managers; but the different sets of rules between the two generations can collide in workplaces as well as business. Through his work in management consulting,   stumbled across plenty of conventional companies searching for ways to adopt startup-minded perspectives. “I noticed that there’s no platform that would enable and encourage a senior management-level dialogue to support the transformation of their company,” Leskinen explains. “I decided to build an adapter between the current leadership and the future.” This is important, because what happens next isn’t in the hands of those in power now. “Old business models might lose their energy if they just remain in their bubble. We need to find new problems – as well as radical ways to solve them.” “It can come as a genuine surprise that our generation doesn’t see owning a house as a necessity, or deem a summer cottage or a car as status symbol,” states Perttu Pölonen.  has founded a community of millennials from diverse disciplines, now consisting of over 300 young professionals. Whenever a corporation is looking for insights, a team of suitable individuals is sent out to the task in the form of workshops and meetings. Founder and CEO Leskinen hopes that one day the board could serve multinational companies with multinational teams. At the moment, Millennial Board has communities in four cities in Finland as well as one in Oslo, London and Stockholm. “By the end of the year, we’ll have a community in 10 countries,” he promises. , Millennial Board’s community manager in Helsinki, says that although the community members come from different fields, they share innovativeness as well as courage to be vocal about their opinions to established experts. “In the meetings, there are no CEOs or CTOs or students, but people go by their first names,” she notes. That appeals to the community of millennials, too. Although the financial compensation for their participation is not significant, they gain experience in industries they might’ve never really taken note of before – especially the ones that struggle to make themselves attractive in the eyes of the young. Those tend to be the companies in need of Millennial Board’s services, such as insurance and utility businesses. For companies, the benefits lie in new aspects as to how to maintain the relevance of their products or services, or even how to pivot completely if necessary. The other angle is recruiting: how can a company ensure the biggest talents are eager to work for it? At times, the answer might be something the senior managers never thought about. “For example, once we were asked how much we’d need to be paid in order to work for the company,” Peltola recalls. “We told them they’re asking the wrong question. Instead, they should contemplate what other value the work can offer, how it betters society and what skills it teaches.” Community member   has noticed the same thing. “Sometimes we’re asked if we   think how we claim to think,” he says. “It can come as a genuine surprise that our generation doesn’t see owning a house as a necessity or deem a summer cottage or a car a status symbol.” Some clients have already asked community members to join their boards. As change is constant, Leskinen’s goal is to develop Millennial Board’s presence in its customer companies to a long-lasting partnership. “That would make us a continuous sidekick, a sort of devil’s advocate,” he says laughingly. “That way companies can ensure they’re on the ball and ready to disrupt their own business models. If they don’t, their competitors will.” Heikki Leskinen founded Millennial Board to combat the status quo in corporations."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/polar-bear-pitching-keeps-cool/,Polar Bear Pitching keeps it cool once again,"This year’s Polar Bear Pitching brought a dozen startups together to the one place: an ice hole in the sea. The northern Finnish city of Oulu is many things: the self-proclaimed ‘Capital of Northern Scandinavia’, the home of the Air Guitar World Championships and a buzzing hotbed of tech solutions that range from pioneering connectivity to health and wellness. Markus “Black Raven” Vainiopää makes it wail. Yet, at the moment it could be quite simply said that Oulu is cold. Freezing, in fact, at 11 degrees below zero. The conditions are so extreme that they delayed the start of this year’s   semi-finals yesterday by one-and-a-half hours. The ice hole where entrepreneurs pitch from had frozen solid overnight and needed to be recut. “We promoted the event as being held at the coldest time of the year, and we got it,” states founder  , with a smile. “This is the coldest ever of the five events we have held. Now, 12 startups are readying themselves to step into the hole for tonight’s final, delivering pitches that range from the next heated garment revolution, to sparking electric mobility in Europe, virtual health assistants and pain measurements. A panel of international investors huddle on a bench before them, looking for the next opportunity to enable a fledgling startup to flourish, judging both business potential and pitching performance. The final prize: 10 000 euros and a trip to Nanjing, China’s so-called ‘mini Silicon Valley’. The roots of the event can be traced back to 2013 when Nokia’s fortunes had just plunged. As Oulu’s economy leaned heavily on the telecommunications giant, the city faced an unprecedented challenge. Enter the innovative mind of Mia Kemppaala, who was involved at  the entrepreneurship hub of the   and  . It was decided to turn Oulu’s Arctic chill and geographic isolation to its advantage. “Instead of hiding our differences, I thought that, ‘let’s turn it upside down and make it a focal point, the wow factor’,” she recalls. “We should put entrepreneurs in a hole, and in doing so they cut to the chase and make themselves understood. They have to talk in simple terms to get the point across. “It’s so crazy, we just have to do it.” Some five years later, the event has grown into an international spectacle and has attracted press including  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . The chilly pitching conditions are merely the tip of the iceberg of eccentricities on offer. Finns are among the highest consumers of ice-cream per capita on a global scale, hence local dairy product producer Valio’s new range is, naturally, on hand to be sampled. “Finns are really crazy, eating ice-cream when its –11 degrees,” underlines host  , with no small understatement. The off-kilter combination of salmiakki and chilli provides the perfect taste for what comes next. Rock music blasts from the speakers and air guitar world champion   is suddenly bounding around the pitching area, a blur of fingers on an imaginary fretboard. His rapid movement and flailing limbs may have just as much to do with feeling the music, as they do with the practical matter of keeping warm. Things then take a more formal turn, if that’s possible in such circumstances. Finland’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Development,  , takes to the ice hole to deliver a welcome speech. “I want to make sure…that we are an open, international society, and that we welcome all ideas, all entrepreneurs, all startups and investors to Finland,” he declares. From there, one-by-one the startups begin their long walk down the stairs, past the cheering crowd to take their turn the ice hole. Some enter slowly and gingerly, and others charge in like their life depends on it. It’s a fitting approach, as for some, the success of their business does actually hinge on their performance. “Wow, that’s good,” exclaims the CEO of Russian startup TuSion,  , upon calmly stepping into the icy water. “Better than I thought.” He and colleague   proceed to inform all about the company’s app, which can improve the cognitive abilities of the user while playing games. Unlike in all other pitching competitions, there is no time limit at Polar Bear Pitching– only one’s threshold for extreme cold. The brave soul who comes closest to the event record of 4:53 is   CEO  . Russian duo TuSion brave the sub-zero temperature to deliver an entertaining argument for how their app can improve cognitive abilities while playing games. “Good evening polar people, and bears,” he yells, having received a rousing response from the crowd when plunging himself neck-deep in the freezing water. Seemingly unperturbed by the chill surrounding him, Collander spends four minutes touting the merits of a service which enables travellers to retrieve items confiscated from them by airport security. After the dozen startups have taken the icy stage, the top three companies are chosen by the judges. Cotio makes the final cut, along with CastPrint, which produces 3D-printed solutions for patients with bone fractures. ArtiSun is then announced as the overall winner, having found an innovative way to produce LED lighting for greenhouses. “We are cheaper, we are more environmental, we will help to decrease light pollution and we will increase yield,” the company’s  had summarised during her pitch, which was punctuated by a sole pause to gather her composure. This discomfort is  a distant memory, however, once standing in front of the applauding crowd, with the winner’s cheque for 10 000 euros firmly in hand. “Thank you so much everyone, and I’m ready to go in again,” she declares, unable to contain her delight. Cotio CEO Kimmo Collander stares down the competition."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/askel-healthcare-takes-steps-towards-healthier-pets/,Askel Healthcare takes steps towards healthier pets,"This Finnish health startup has discovered the fountain of youth – at least for worn out joints. Fuelled by a passion for animals, its cartilage repair innovation, initially designed for humans, is now making its way to slightly furrier markets. Damaged cartilage is one of the most common health problems around the world, causing impaired movement to a billion people. Even so, the available treatment methods are mainly temporary or involve artificial joints. In Finland, this lack of an effective natural remedy sparked a project in 2009 that eventually led to a completely new way of healing joints. However, when science was turned into business the focus changed. A significant gap in the market was identified. “Severe osteoarthritis in pets is often a question of life and death,” says  , the CEO and co-founder of  . “We realised that there is no treatment in veterinary medicine that would permanently heal cartilage.” Until now, that is. Nonetheless, the wellbeing of our four-legged friends was far from being on the radar back in 2009. The original research project by the   and   sought to prevent the emergence of osteoarthritis in humans by regrowing damaged cartilage. The biodegradable implant temporarily fills the hole that the worn-out cartilage has left in the joint. It then eventually dissolves while new cartilage is formed, leaving room for new, healthy tissue. “The idea was to create an environment on the surface of the joint where natural cartilage regeneration would be possible, so that permanent healing could take place,” Muhonen recalls. Following much trial and error, the project resulted in a new type of implant, COPLA Scaffold, a long-term solution that has not been seen on the market before. The innovation lies in the implant’s texture, which is porous enough to provide fertile ground for new cells, but at the same time is capable of adapting to the heavy loading of the weight-bearing joint, acting as a temporary cartilage while the tissue heals. “The idea is to treat the damage when it is still small,” says Muhonen. “In a way, it is like reversing time, taking the joint back to a healthy start.” Muhonen and her Askel Healthcare co-founder,  , actually already had a working product back in 2012, when the original research project ended. But they were left with questions about how to turn it into a business. Enter Tekes (nowadays  ), whose funding, advice and contacts enabled the commercialisation of the scientific results. “When the aim is a new medical treatment method, it’s not much help if it doesn’t move further than an academic article,” says Virpi Muhonen (far left). During several years of development, it became clear that a change of direction was needed, as the market approval of the product for human use would become too expensive and too time consuming. The focus promptly switched to animals. “We realised that horses and dogs have the exact same problems, and animal healthcare is a growing business sector,” says Muhonen. “So, we decided to forget about human knees and hips for a while, and instead put all of our efforts into the veterinarian market.” Askel Healthcare was founded in March 2017. By October, the company had sold its first implants in Finland. “We have received really positive feedback about how painless it is for dogs to move shortly after the operation – they just heal really fast,” Muhonen enthuses. Now, the young startup is marching forward with increasing speed – and 650 000 euros of recently raised crowdfunding. The money is being used to open its production unit this spring, which will then see COPLA Scaffold entering international markets. Sales are also set to commence in the UK this year, where there is already a network of interested veterinarians. While the natural next step initially was to establish themselves on the European market, a happy coincidence is taking them further afield: one of the British orthopaedists they met in the UK has since moved to Florida. “This then lead to a distributor that we will probably sign a deal with, as soon as we get the production price fixed,” says Muhonen. She emphasises the importance of pricing the product in a way that prevents it from being a luxury product for performance enhancement, and instead makes it widely available for animal wellbeing. “This is not only about making money, but about our love for animals,” Muhonen summarises.  is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-popular-articles-2017/,Five for Friday: Our most popular articles in 2017,"Just before we shut up shop for the year, let’s take a look back at the notable articles that caught your eyes. From superheroes to insoles, all the way to chocolate, music streaming and pet sitting, a diversity of industries was much appreciated en masse. Although he had prior experience working on commercials and music videos,   had actually never been on the set of a feature film. That didn’t stop him from rolling cameras on Finland’s first superhero movie,  . Luckily, he was not alone. “We filmed for 14 weeks, 20 hours a day with a low budget and big challenges; we didn’t sleep or eat,” Haaja recounts. “Luckily, I realised early on that I need to surround myself with people who are more capable than me.” Finnish insoles manufacturer   argues that the foundation for our entire bodies – our feet – have been sadly neglected. The company has set out to correct this by making insoles custom-moulded to each user. “Once you try [the product] you quickly get addicted, and you’ll always want to have that same feeling,” states founder  . “So, it’s kind of a drug for your feet, but legal!” At  , chocolatier   needs only three ingredients for making his delicacies from scratch: cacao nibs, cane sugar and milk powder. The ecological and handmade bean-to-bar production line gives every bite a unique flavour. “Chocolate is a fascinating raw material that could be made into anything – the sky is the limit,” he enthuses. Chinese law decrees that in order for music providers to ply their trade, one needs to have a company and all servers in China. To facilitate such access,   partnered up with a Chinese company to create a distribution service for independent musicians and record labels. “We are building a bridge between Asia and the Western countries,” explains CEO    . This service sets out to alleviate the concerns of travel-loving pet owners by introducing them to pet sitters. Alongside dog walking, home visits and pet boarding,   has ambitious plans: in the future, the service will include things like pet-friendly taxi companies and pet grooming services. “We don’t want people who only do it for money,” Shevchenko explains. “We want pet sitters to genuinely love animals and have experience in looking after them.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/immersal-mixed-reality-approved-aisopos/,Immersal is mixed reality approved by Aisopos,"Finnish Immersal is, in its own words, “yet another AR company with a whale”. However, its insanely scalable retail solution is much more than just that. , “co-founder of Greece”, has called any big venue without augmented reality (AR) “a foolish venue” – if you believe  . You probably shouldn’t, as Aisopos clearly didn’t say that: although he was a storyteller, it’s highly unlikely he’s been making statements about a technology that appeared over 2 000 years after his death. Jufo Peltomaa has had a vision of Immersal’s idea since the ’90s. Immersal co-founder and VP of business development  , are you making a funny? “We’re probably just a cheerful exception for reporters going through press releases, as on average they make for a pretty boring read,” he states, referring to Immersal’s hilarious yet informatively near-zero approach to making announcements. “We started out like that when our product was still in development and we needed to keep it a secret, but now that it’s out, there’s no real reason for it – I suppose it just stuck with us.” Immersal’s wit is omnipresent in its image, including job adverts in which the company hopes for someone with a nice car (“we don’t have decent cars so we’d like to use yours”). This, in Peltomaa’s view, is an excellent way of gaining attention in the intensely competitive field of software developer recruitment – and finding the people with the right kind of mindset. “With customers, partners and investors we’re consistently very professional,” he points out. “It might look like we’re just joking, but really it’s a carefully selected tone of voice with an aim and a purpose.” Whether you’re laughing or not, Immersal has plenty of reasons for raising a few smiles. In December,   a half-a-million-euro seed round with prominent investors on the list. This goes to show Immersal’s product is serious business. The company develops AR experiences for large spaces, such as shopping malls and other retail venues. A customer can look for shops, restaurants, products and additional product information, as well as tempting offers or collectable points inside a shopping complex using his or her own mobile device and Immersal’s app. All this spells improved shopping experiences and hence opportunities for boosting revenue – and saving money. “Ads and real time offers can hang in midair and the app acts like a clerk, explaining where things are and giving more information about products,” Peltomaa explains. “A customer looking for tinfoil can find it in two seconds instead of having to get lost and frustrated in a hypermarket. Who knew it’d be in the paper product section?” The technology has been tried out at Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre in Finland and is currently being installed in Finnkino cinemas. The future looks grand, as the world is crowded with potential AR users (anyone with a smartphone). Peltomaa predicts that in 2019, Immersal will have 100 stores using its solution, a year later the number will be 10 000 – and in 2022, it’ll have quadrupled. How? Why? “We’re aiming for  ,” he says. “So far, each destination has meant a fair deal of manual labour from our side, but soon enough any retailer can activate Immersal and drag and drop whatever they wish around their premise.” Co-founder and creative director Teemu Berglund Peltomaa’s history with digital realities goes way beyond the recent fad, as in 1995 he was one of the first people to import VR helmets to Finland and use them in advertising. “They were absolutely terrible at the time, but we had a 150-metre queue of people wanting to test them at a fair,” he recalls. “We told everyone not to have their expectations too high.” The technology has advanced in huge leaps, and Peltomaa has been involved in setting up a couple of successful tech companies. Even so, he’s not a fan of VR or AR – as words, that is. “Mixed reality, XR, is the best expression,” he tells. “With AR and VR, it can be difficult to tell the difference. The technology is developing so rapidly that we’ll soon be in virtual reality experiencing augmented reality within which there’s virtual reality and yet still more augmented reality… So yeah, it’s pretty mixed.” He should know, as does the rest of the Immersal team. Peltomaa refers to the gang of nine owners as a “team of gods” and says, “the others are much cooler than I am”. He believes that in addition to real customer cases, this track record is one of the reasons investors have had the courage to put their money into Immersal. The market potential is vast, too. Peltomaa points out that although online shopping has bitten a big chunk of traditional sales, real-life stores haven’t disappeared, and won’t for a long time. “Our retail solution blends together online and physical shopping. There might be a day when physical stores disappear and we have Matrix-level digital technology to replace them with, but not next Wednesday,” Peltomaa grins. Co-founder Jufo Peltomaa"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nayadaya-makes-digital-emotions-matter/,NayaDaya makes digital emotions matter,"A simple thumb pointed up or down doesn’t quite represent the vast variety of human emotions. NayaDaya wants to be a forerunner in digital emotional communications. How does that make you  ? Marketing professionals have long understood what draws consumers: it’s evoking emotions, leaving them feel touched. Buying a certain phone or drinking a particular tea is meaningful not only in pragmatic terms, but also on an emotional level. CEO Timo Järvinen However, feedback is often collected in much simpler ways. Telling how happy one is with a service on a scale of one to five or clicking on a smiling or frowning face often suffices for companies as an indicator of how they’re doing. But it shouldn’t, deems Finnish  . Co-founder and CEO   points out that being able to express feelings and being heard, understood and accepted are fundamental human needs. “Places where the emotions of others are often left ignored are those where empathy doesn’t really shine through, like social media,” he says. “A lot of understanding is lost between people when we communicate through digital channels without seeing each other eye to eye.” Järvinen and the rest of the seven-strong NayaDaya team want to add emotions to the digital world. Hence, the company has launched a platform that enables people to express the feelings caused by what they’ve just seen, read, heard or experienced. Its set of 20 emotion families is based on research conducted by the Geneva Emotion Research Group at the University of Geneva. “We’re creating added value for digital interaction,” Järvinen explains. “On top of that, we’re building a huge pool of big data of emotional responses.” NayaDaya’s solution has been in development for two years. Now, any website or digital service can integrate it to collect data about its users’ emotional reactions. For example, media group Keskisuomalainen has tested it on its online news publication Helsingin Uutiset, and US-based digital healthcare company Thrivors on its platform for cancer survivors. Jorvi Hospital, part of Helsinki University Hospital, will pilot the solution for measuring and developing mental health patient experiences. One of the benefits of the service is that it makes people feel listened to. However, ultimately most firms would expect a measurable return on investment. Järvinen emphasises that there are as many ways to make use of the data as there are industries. NayaDaya refers to its service as “human emotions on digital platforms”. “For example, online publications can find out what kind of emotional engagement arises from their content, or healthcare services are able to understand patients’ experiences.” As big data is called   for a reason, responses need to be collected en masse. Järvinen believes that for this, the full range of human emotions 20 feelings helps: most people would find a suitable icon to reflect their reaction. “Of course, you can get more reactions from just a thumbs-up or -down questionnaire,” he says. “But there’s not much you can do with the data later, as it gives no insight as to what kinds of positive or negative emotions took place.” NayaDaya’s plan is to find customers and partners in the fields of digital media, health and education. However, the scope is not at all limited to the three. Järvinen believes that pretty much any industry could find the tool useful, be it in employment wellbeing or customer care. “In today’s world, we’re constantly measuring our bodies with all sorts of gadgets,” he says. “This data ignores psychological elements.” Hence the company isn’t limiting itself to specific markets. The goal is to internationalise – and quickly. Its first trip to Asia is already looming, and there are ongoing negotiations in the US. After all, emotions aren’t geographically limited. Facebook alone has reported that 60 million emojis are used on its service every day, on top of the hefty five billion sent over Messenger. “I don’t see people’s willingness to show their emotions diminishing,” Järvinen notes. “No matter how they’re measured.” NayaDaya’s model The model is based on pre-existing scientific research independently conducted and published by the Geneva Emotion Research Group."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-emotions-go-digital/,Five for Friday: Emotions go digital,"No matter how digital the world goes, human emotions are still inside us. This week, we look at how digital services and devices can tap into the market of feelings. Although smartphones and other devices are often blamed for distancing people from each other, they can also be used to make us better understand both each other and ourselves. Allow these five examples from Finland tell you how. The company wants to improve the happiness levels of employees by helping support staff and outsourced services improve the quality of their offering. This is not only about soft values and employee experience; all of it can be converted into hard currency, as inefficiency costs money. “It wasn’t long ago when companies were saying ‘workers always complain anyway’,” CEO    . “Now they see the value, including financial, of keeping staff happy and loyal.” A finger can provide a surprising amount of information of what’s going on inside us. Finnish healthtech company   has created a design jewel known as Ōura that can be used to capture all this data, which can then be interpreted on a mobile app. This is meant to help ring-bearers improve their wellbeing. “The ring helps its user understand his or her body even better,” CEO   and CTO and head of design    . “With the information we can pay attention to our mental and physical readiness, and try and maintain them at the highest possible level.” If you’ve never had your very own agony aunt, no need to worry: Finnish Auntie brings one to everyone with access to a digital device and Internet connection. Auntie is a preventive therapy service that combines digital and live sessions, and also works as a middle ground between face-to-face psychotherapy and self-help tools. “Unfortunately, humankind isn’t running out of crises,” co-founder    . “What’s changing now is that people, including employers, better understand that doing situps and pushups doesn’t suffice to ensure people are well and fit for work.” “Behind each customer there is more than numbers and statistics – there is life,” says Sailer, a videographic research company from Helsinki. Sailer collects market research data on video and presents the results in the form of a documentary film, believing this enables people to communicate emotions and effectively. “Humans aren’t only about numbers,” founder-CEO    . “On a scale from one to five, someone’s two might be someone else’s four. We want to develop a profound understanding instead of averages.” The NayaDaya team wants to add emotions to the digital world with their platform that lets people to express the emotions caused by what they’ve just seen, read, heard or experienced. The tool can be integrated to any website or digital service. “Places where the emotions of others are often left ignored are those where empathy doesn’t really shine through, like social media,” co-founder and CEO    . “A lot of understanding is lost between people when we communicate through digital channels without seeing each other eye to eye.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-innovators-taste-success-with-the-sun/,Finnish innovators taste success with the Sun,"Over two billion people worldwide use a contaminated source for their drinking water. It is a striking statistic, and one Finnish cleantech company Solar Water Solutions believes it can help to change.  Water is essential for life, but access to clean water is far from guaranteed. In many places globally, water is collected directly from rivers, rainwater pools and the sea. The trouble is these water sources often contain impurities and salt, making waterborne illnesses a widespread problem. “We want to get our operations in Kenya rolling and then expand to nearby areas,” says Antti Pohjola. Although various water treatment technologies exist, they can be expensive and off-limits to remote areas outside electricity grids. This is where Espoo-based   comes in. The company has combined solar power with the   method to create a low-cost, low-emission technology for purifying contaminated water. “In many of these areas, clean water is produced with the same reverse osmosis method but is powered by diesel generators,” explains CEO  “It is a very energy-intensive process, so the running costs are high. We use free solar energy and produce no emissions.” Solar Water Solutions claims it can reduce the operating costs of water treatment by up to 90 per cent. This has the potential to bring clean water within reach of the world’s most impoverished areas, but also to small islands, remote holiday resorts, farms and other locations where energy sources are scarce. The only thing required is the Sun. Solar Water Solutions was founded in 2015 based on an idea from Pohjola’s father,  . He discovered a way to harness solar energy for water purification without the need for expensive batteries or energy storage. Exactly how this works is a company secret, but Pohjola says it solves the problem of spikes in solar power, ensuring the system works smoothly even on cloudier days. “If we would need to use batteries the costs would multiply, which wouldn’t be economically viable,” he stresses. The company’s technology was developed further in collaboration with   in Finland, before a commercial launch in 2017. Now Solar Water Solutions produces mobile water treatment units in different sizes, from single-family systems all the way to covering the needs of a small village. Fountain of inspiration: half of the world’s population is predicted to be living in water-stressed areas by 2040. The units are manufactured in Finland and exported in co-operation with local partners. The company’s latest milestone was reached in Africa. Previously it had delivered small household devices to the continent, but since early 2018 its water treatment unit has produced clean water for an entire village community in the Kenyan countryside. The project is part of the company’s collaboration with the aid organisation World Vision. “It is our first big unit in Africa,” Pohjola enthuses. “It also one of the very first solar energy powered water treatment units in the whole of Africa.” While Africa’s off-grid areas are Solar Water Solutions’ primary focus for now, the company believes its technology has global pull – notably for the notoriously dry Middle East. In 2017, the company set up a test facility in Abu Dhabi, where its technology is used to desalinate seawater. “The United Arab Emirates is an arid country. Up to 80 per cent of its clean water is produced from seawater using very energy intensive processes,” Pohjola explains. “This is why the region leads the development of new solar-powered systems for treating salt water. We want to be close to this development.” Solar Water Solutions’ efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. Last year it placed third in the UAE’s Global Water Awards, from 138 projects globally. The number of entrants also signals the size of the problem the company is addressing, and it is only expected to grow. “The estimate is close to half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2040,” Pohjala says. “We can produce clean water locally and with free solar energy. The market for these kinds of technologies is huge.” Solar Water Solutions’ mobile desalination and water treatment units come in various sizes, from household devices all the way to covering the needs of entire hospitals or holiday resorts."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/buddy-healthcare-helps-with-the-road-to-recovery/,Buddy Healthcare helps with the road to recovery,"This innovative care coordination and patient engagement platform enables patients to stay on track during their lead up to surgery and subsequent recovery. Your buddies play an important role during surgeries. And whilst it may have been their antics that helped land you under the knife in the first place, their post-surgery visits offer an encouraging boost during the healing process. But, obviously, mates can’t be on hand during every step along the way. Enter  , the digital alternative that seeks to improve patients’ pre-surgery preparation and recuperation in its aftermath. The company’s story began in the US a few years ago, when CEO   had a discussion with a children’s hospital there about its very specific challenges regarding outpatient surgeries. The app caters to all stages of the surgery process. These sentiments were echoed upon his return to his homeland. “I talked with Finnish hospitals and learned they had the same challenges,” Määttä recalls. “There were no solutions on the market so I decided to build my own business.” Buddy Healthcare was thus founded in the autumn of 2015. The company’s solution addresses some of the biggest challenges that are faced regarding surgeries: patient adherence to treatment, late cancellations and no-shows, administrative work and care quality. Buddy Healthcare counters these by offering patient education, care coordination, data collection and analysis via its automated clinical pathways. “The BuddyCare app provides patients with all the information they need to navigate through the surgery process,” Määttä explains. “Nurses and doctors use our web tool to track which patients are doing well and which ones need more attention. Patients are ‘flagged’ when there is an exception in their pathway.” Care providers meet the needs of different types of patients by combining information, questionnaires, photos, videos, reminders, outcome measurements or rehabilitation exercises. Buddy Healthcare’s first co-development partners were paediatric hospitals, but now it also works with orthopaedics, cardiology and plastic surgery. “Imagination is the only limit,” says Määttä. “We just provide a platform for hospitals to create their own automated mobile care pathways.” Currently, Buddy Healthcare’s solution is being used in several public and private Finnish hospitals. Global expansion is beckoning. Jussi Määttä founded Buddy Healthcare in the autumn of 2015, with the goal of creating automated clinical pathways for the patient journey. “As a Finnish company, we have to look at international markets immediately,” Määttä says. “Finland is a good test market and hospitals are open to new solutions, but the local market is relatively small. We have projects ongoing in the Americas and are starting our first projects in Central Europe as well.” Määttä credits the company’s co-development partners in Finland and the US for its successful solution, and encourages other digital health companies to work with hospitals as soon as possible. “When hospitals innovate with you they commit to change at the same time,” he says. “[They] really want to be forerunners in digital transformation.” As Buddy Healthcare makes the transition from startup to stability, it is keeping both eyes open to better its business. It has even commenced testing how to smarten pathways for hospitals and patients by using AI. Regardless of the innovations it may harness in future, Määttä insists that the company’s goal remains the same. “When talking about digital health you have to remember that the number one task of the hospital is to save lives and cure people. I’m glad that we can play a part in that.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vimma-fashion-zero-secrets/,Vimma is fashion with zero secrets,"What started out as a harmless hobby for a stay-at-home mother is now a global fashion brand with world-renowned designers on board. Midwifery is  ’s calling. The mother of six, who’d looked after her children at home for several years, always planned to go back to work by the time she turned 40. In August last year, the round number was approaching. The thought was still in the back of her mind, but things around her had changed radically. She was, and is now, the founder, owner and CEO of internationally operating children’s clothing brand  . Marjut Rahkola “I really had to contemplate it, as I love midwifery and respect it immensely,” she says. “Then I decided that I’ve still got too much passion for Vimma to let it go. This child isn’t ready to face the world without me yet!” Designing clothes and sewing were initially just hobbies that Rahkola took up when, after three boys, her fourth child was a girl. She found herself creating one dress after another – and realised she’s not the only one keen on kidswear. Together with her twin sister, she started importing children’s clothing from brands that weren’t available in Finland at the time. However, seeing the brands they had uncovered become available in more and more online stores made the siblings lose enthusiasm. Rahkola continued sewing her own designs, and her and her friends had a habit of arranging photoshoots of the clothes and their children. “There was no real reason for it; I’m not on Facebook or other social media so I didn’t even publish the photos anywhere. It was pretty intense though, a lot of resources and time went into it.” Then one of Rahkola’s friends told Marimekko about her doings. Suddenly, what used to be a leisure pursuit turned into a job: for many years, she designed for the world-famous Finnish design brand, with no formal education in design whatsoever. The selection for women is growing, as many mothers have fallen in love with the prints on their children’s clothes. After years at Marimekko and studies at Helsinki Design School, Rahkola realised that she’d regret it for the rest of her life if she didn’t try her wings with her own brand. Some friends from the Marimekko times were immediately interested in helping her out. With Rahkola creating the clothes and other people drawing the prints, the first Vimma pieces started to take form. The company was founded in 2013. Rahkola’s core idea is to produce high quality, sustainable clothing that suits all situations, with practical cuts and cool, attractive prints. Initially, the collections were for children and their mothers. Now, the selection for women is expanding more and more, and there are unisex products for adults as well. “Everyone in the family can wear the same print if they want to,” Rahkola says. One of the guiding principles for Vimma is good taste. It doesn’t only apply to designs and prints; it also dictates each choice, from materials and packaging to production facilities. Vimma’s manufacturing happens in Lithuania and Estonia, and Rahkola visits the factories regularly to stay up to date and maintain trust between all partners – including customers. “We bear the environment in mind with everything, transparently and honestly. Whatever our customers want to know about our production processes, we can tell them. There’s nothing we need to hide.” At the moment, Vimma has two stores in Finland and a global online store, through which orders come in from all over the world. The next big steps that await are increasing international visibility and finding suitable business models to conquer new markets with. Vimma is particularly keen to see what the nearby regions, as well as Japan and North America, have to offer. “Hopefully, this year will be a big one for us when it comes to internationalisation,” Rahkola tells. “Although Vimma isn’t hugely famous in Finland, the growth has been rapid, and we’ve met all the targets we’ve set for ourselves.” As the owner of the company, with her brother as a minor shareholder, Rahkola has a lot of power over the direction Vimma is taking. Despite the plentiful plans and ambitions, she hasn’t fully given up the thought of returning to the labour ward. “If one day I feel like I’ve got nothing more to give, I can imagine going back to midwifery. Right now, the spark I have for Vimma is there and strong as ever.” Vimma’s clothes can be ordered by boys, girls and everyone else around the world."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-kidswear/,Five for Friday: Kidswear,"Finland is known for being a good place to be a parent and a child. It might be because of this that Finnish designers know how to make classy stuff for kids to wear, too. Kids grow up quickly and can sometimes play – literally – dirty. These five companies want to help the little ones dress up in classy, high-quality clothing that doesn’t need to be thrown away when it no longer fits. The core idea behind Mainio’s brand lies in its relaxed, contemporary and street-style prints and cuts, convenience and comfort. As we noted in our article  , ambitious design doesn’t have to compromise practicality, both in wearing and washing. Co-founder and managing director   is proud of the team spirit amongst Finnish kids’ clothing brands. “People don’t think it’s dangerous to share information and help others,” she said. “If anything, we’re all in the same boat, trying to go global together.” Designing clothes and sewing were initially just hobbies for Vimma’s owner and CEO  . For her, good taste is essential, be it in logistics, packaging materials or the final prints. “We bear the environment in mind with everything, transparently and honestly,” she told us  . “Whatever our customers want to know about our production processes, we can tell them. There’s nothing we need to hide.”  and  , two sisters with six children altogether, were never happy with the clothes they bought for their kids. They decided it was time to take action. “We want to only sell clothes we’d buy or wear ourselves,” Valli revealed to    . “Sometimes we get requests to make adult sizes of a particular children’s product, but unless we really believe it’s a good idea, we won’t do it.” Eco-friendliness and responsibility are the guidelines not only for Papu’s products, but also their production. The company wants to produce clothes good enough to make them collectables. “When a new catalogue comes out, the products from the previous seasons still don’t get old,” founder   explained  . “Hopefully the opposite will happen: sold-out clothes become sought-after rarities.” With the four previous companies in our group more recently founded, Reima stands out from the pack with its well-established position: the company was founded back in 1944. On a more modern note, it’s adding intelligence, namely a wearable movement sensor and free mobile app, to its offering. “The sensor doesn’t monitor children’s heart rate or calories,” we reported  . “It measures the intensity and duration of children’s physical activity during the day.” Last year, Reima was   in the US, with Lapland playing a pivotal role in its consumer campaign."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/chinese-get-sync-finnish-skating/,Chinese get in sync with Finnish skating,"Synchronised skating is a disciplined sport that works for the good of both mind and body. Now, Finnish expertise on ice is travelling to Chinese schools. Jukka-Pekka Vuorinen Young girls in ice skates, all dressed in black, are watching a Zamboni slowly make its way across the rink at Helsinki Ice Hall. A men’s ice hockey practice has just ended, and some maintenance needs to be finished before the eagerly awaiting girls can start their own. When the gate finally opens, the girls flood onto the ice and start warming up: skating backwards hand in hand, akin to an eloquent dance. Together, they form a synchronised skating team, trained by two-time world champion  . “Synchronised skating is great for its diversity,” Spiridovitsh explains. “It requires physical strength and coordination, good balance, sense of rhythm and stamina. It’s also a team sport, as you can’t do it alone and have to be considerate of others all the time.” These characteristics are beneficial for everyone, and the Chinese have taken note. Late last year, the Finnish Synchronized Skating Academy, owned by  ’s company  , started to collaborate with Chinese company Wisdom Sport to spread the joys of synchronised skating to schools in Beijing. Plenty of coincidences took place before any papers were inked. For example, Beijing’s Shijingshan District has various partnerships with Mänttä-Vilppula, a town in Pirkanmaa, where the long-time ice hockey and sports business professional Vuorinen happens to run his company and work with the city council. “The Chinese partners asked if we could help them bring synchronised skating to China,” Vuorinen says. “So, here we are.” As the host of the 2022 Winter Olympics, a vast sports project is looming for China. Vuorinen says that there has been mention of adding synchronised skating to the competition’s programme. “If the host country is in favour of the sport, it’s easier to get it through in the committee,” he notes. “This would pose a huge opportunity for Finnish skaters in their hunt for medals, so in that sense it’s a joint goal.” At a minimum, synchronised skating can gain visibility in the opening ceremony or side events. If everything goes to plan, the performers and their coaches will be trained by Spiridovitsh and other Finnish experts. “Laura is excellent, if only she could be copied!” Vuorinen praises. “She’s a two-time world champion and holds a master’s degree in sport and health sciences, and also is a wonderful teacher.” Sani Teerimäki (left), Emelie Lindeman and Ada Pieninkeroinen are Laura Spiridovitsh’s (right) students in Helsinki. Spiridovitsh has already paid her first visit to China. In the future, Vuorinen believes that Finnish trainers will move to China to teach full-time for a few years at a time. At the moment, the project partners are preparing training materials, and in a couple of months’ time another set of trainers will travel to China. Come summer, Chinese skaters will flock to Finland for a training camp. In between, connections are dealt with digitally. The path is long: one doesn’t become an Olympian in a heartbeat. However, Vuorinen sees this as a huge window for exporting Finnish sports excellence in other fields as well, especially women’s sports. One of the challenges is to find suitable and available people to meet the immense demand. This year, the collaboration will include a couple of groups from five schools. When talking about China, the number of people, and therefore potential talent, is instantly on a grand scale. “That’s also one of the reasons the Chinese were interested in synchronised skating instead of other winter sports to begin with,” Vuorinen explains. “It mobilises a lot of children at once and supports the education institutions’ other goals, too, including team work and other social skills.” Synchronised skating has both physical and psychological elements, so it’s a great sport for school children, too."

Ken Mulvany, chairman and founder of BenevolentAI, opened the Founder Stage on Friday. His topic was a healthy one: can technology cure disease? ”In healthcare, AI is the new black,” he said. The discussion between president of Tencent Martin Lau and co-founder and CEO of Supercell Ilkka Paananen must’ve been one of the most anticipated meetings of the event. Lau complimented Finnish society and Supercell’s willingness to share its success with the nation. Paananen, for his part, pointed out that Finland has a real opportunity to turn into a leading tech hub, not just in Europe but globally. Hi there, astronaut!

Finnish Canatu visited Slush to announce a capital raise of 12 million euros from DENSO, Ascend Capital Partners and its existing investor Faurecia. Marketing director Katja Mälkki and CEO Juha Kokkonen were, understandably, excited. “Slush is a show in itself with plenty of media attention, so announcing the news here doubles or triples our visibility,” Kokkonen noted. Irish John Kennedy, a journalist for Silicon Republic, was experiencing his first-ever Slush.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/oulu-s-future-good-health/,Oulu’s future is in good health,"This thriving northern hub has a global reputation for ICT and wireless technologies. We pop by to learn more about how this is driving innovation in health and wellness. In 2008, Nokia’s fall from grace threatened to topple the Oulu economy, as the telecommunications giant haemorrhaged employees from its operations there in the wake of its declining fortunes. However, in typical Oulu fashion, the local economy dusted itself off and set about flourishing in other sectors. “Nokia brought a lot of knowledge to the city,” explains  , executive director at local regional development office  . “It diversified the ICT sector into many areas: financial software; cleantech and the circular economy; and health and life sciences.” OuluHealth’s ecosystem approach enables the combination of expertise from wireless information technologies and life sciences to introduce smart ICT solutions for delivering advanced, personalised, connected health service solutions. The knock-on effect of the latter in particular has ignited a hive of activity in Oulu. Leading the charge in this healthy direction is  , an ecosystem which brings together various actors from public and private sectors and local academia to accelerate innovation that meets the needs of the healthcare sector. “There are more than 500 health and life science companies here,” says OuluHealth’s network director  . “People in Oulu are not afraid of technology. If you always play it safe, you achieve nothing.” OuluHealth takes a three-pronged approach to developing local enterprises: business development, a testing environment and scientific research. “There is a big bioscience community and a medical faculty here in Oulu,” Jansson explains. “Our hospital district is very open-minded. They are willing to try new things.” Given the pace that the industry is evolving, the local cluster is keeping a firm eye on the future at all times. One significant OuluHealth member is the   (CTH), an R&D and innovation hub, which connects researchers and entrepreneurs to develop the healthtech solutions of tomorrow together. “It’s a two-way highway between industry and academia,” says  , the centre’s ‎director. “We have a strong multidisciplinary university with competencies in ICT and healthcare.” One of CTH’s core strategies for growth is strengthening its international alliances. The centre’s presence in the   and the   means that Oulu is at the forefront of the digital agenda at a European level. “We are continuously building up healthcare services,” Perälä-Heape states. “We see where the need is and initiate programmes and go forward. This is the way we are working in Oulu.” Medanets is developing mobile solutions for the healthcare industry, especially for the care givers and nurses. The innovative solutions from Oulu being taken to the world cover a wide range of health and wellness needs. Companies such as   and   are leading the charge in the local wearables offering, whereas the likes of   are harnessing technology for more traditional avenues of healthcare provision. “We noticed that nurses are filing reports twice,” says CEO  . “For example, they first record a patient’s vital signs on paper and then again to a computer when back in the office. We solve this with a simple mobile app integrated into the one system.” Given the wireless expertise on display, it’s somewhat unsurprising that the company’s founders have a background in Nokia. Also, less likely to result in jaws on the floor is the fact that the company is on the cusp of a significant international presence. “When I started here six years ago, we were building something that was nice to have for nurses,” Ranta states. “Now I think it is something that is a ‘must have’. “We are Finland’s market leaders, we are getting Sweden next and then the Nordic countries.” Peili Vision sees a bright future ahead for its innovative solution. The pursuit of healthtech solutions in Oulu is also not restricted by such bothersome aspects as physical space. “In Finland, we have long distances to travel and we need some kind of technology to remove them,” explains   CEO  . “So, we are building technology that enables occupational therapists, speech pathologists and neuropsychologists to treat patients in virtual reality.” By harnessing the cutting-edge technology, healthcare professionals can access direct analytics of the rehabilitation process, allowing them to measure progress completely online with exact data. “We are a value-based company,” Auvinen states. “We are really helping people and our solution will save costs in hospitals. We have a good future ahead with a really scalable product. After its launch next year, we can really push it to big markets abroad.” Whilst Auvinen is busying himself with the possibilities of virtual reality, he has a solid grasp of the reality of the local healthtech scene in the here and now. “What is good about Oulu is that it’s easy to talk with other entrepreneurs and collaborate,” Auvinen says. “Even though someone might say we are competitors, we don’t see it that way. If we build things together, we can all gain.”"

They are ingrained in the country’s national identity and are central to its globally-renowned forest industry expertise. Nowhere is this more evident than the eastern city of Joensuu. Forests have always been a source of wellbeing for Finns, both economically and physically. Today, the forest industry accounts for 23 per cent of the country’s exports and covers far more than the traditional focuses of pulp and paper. Read: biofuels, building materials, smart packaging and even clothing. Much of this expertise has accumulates in Joensuu, the capital of Northern Karelia, 75 kilometres from Finland’s border with Russia. “You can find the entire forestry chain here: from education and research, to machinery manufacturing and wood processing,” says  , coordinator at the local  . “There is a lot of technological expertise and internationally acclaimed research. Joensuu is the Silicon Valley of the forest industry.” This claim is backed by some impressive numbers. The city has a population of only 76 000, but hosts two universities, several research organisations – including the   and   (LUKE) – and the world’s largest cut-to-length forestry machine factory which is run by the industry behemoth John Deere. Most crucially it is also home to 500 other forest bioeconomy companies with a combined turnover of almost two billion euros. Kesla exports over 70 per cent of its products. A fitting example of Joensuu’s international reach is the family-owned, stock-listed company  . The forest technology and machinery specialist has operated for almost 60 years and gained a vast customer network exporting over 70 per cent of its products globally. “The EU is as big a market as Japan, Russia and North and South America,” says  , marketing director at Kesla. “We have strong growth in South-East Asia and regions where mechanical harvesting is only starting to take off.” In typically straightforward Finnish fashion Tahvanainen states that the company, with its 250 employees, is a small fish compared to global machinery giants. But Kesla has turned this agility into a competitive advantage. Instead of complete forestry machines, the company creates technologically advanced parts (such as harvester heads and cranes) for other manufacturers’ machinery. This means Kesla can carry an extensive product catalogue for the entire timber harvesting and transporting chain and tailor its products based on customer needs. “For example, we are one of the world’s biggest, if not the biggest, harvester head manufacturer whose products fit any kind of harvester base machine,” Tahvanainen explains. “All of the big machinery companies have their own base machines, but smaller manufacturers without their own harvester heads and cranes don’t necessarily want a competitor’s brand as part of their machinery. We are a neutral operator.” “One of the strengths of Joensuu is that its forest industry cluster attracts a lot of talent,” says Mika Tahvanainen. Technological flexibility is also part of Kesla’s tradition of constant improvement. In 2016 the company launched the world’s first hybrid chipper, developed with LUKE, and it is on a constant lookout for how automation and digitalisation could be applied to its products. “We will see fast changes following the generational shift in our end-users. The younger generations don’t want mechanical systems, everything needs to be digitally and electronically operated,” Tahvanainen says. “But the starting point for us is that everything has to bring added value to our customers. We aren’t digitising things just for the sake of it.” While digitalisation is changing forestry machinery, it is also creating entirely new companies. Finnish technology company   is an early adopter of digital technologies and has used airborne systems for forest resources inventory since 1994. “We provide support for operative decision making, especially regarding natural resources and property, such as railways and electricity lines,” explains  , chief technology officer at Arbonaut. “Our strength is in measuring, analysing and managing vegetation.” Arbonaut’s laser scanning technology and software can be used for tracking forest resources, estimating carbon stocks and monitoring biodiversity around the world. The company’s early claim to fame is its ‘ArboLiDAR’ remote sensing technology. Tested in over 20 countries, the system uses airborne laser scanning to map forest resources and provide information to assist sustainable forest management. The data is visualised on 3D maps to show, for example, which part of a forest is ready for harvesting, if a tree is at a risk of falling on a train track or how biodiversity has changed in a national park. A growing sector for Arbonaut today is climate change data. The company’s software tools can estimate carbon stock changes and model how different actions affect the biosphere over hundreds or even thousands of years. This has already been used in places like Nepal and Pakistan to develop their strategy for reducing emissions which result from deforestation and forest degradation. “Our customer base varies from the Finnish government to US powerline companies and from the Nepalese NGOs to plantation owners in Uruguay,” says  , vice president at Arbonaut. The company’s global appeal also can be seen in its personnel: 45 employees representing 15 different nationalities. It is one of the reasons Arbonaut has put down roots in Joensuu. Kinnunen explains that most of the company’s employees moved to the city because they were attracted to its forestry or ICT education and found a career helping take Arbonaut’s technology to the next level. “The accuracy and quality of data improves constantly,” envisions Arbonaut’s Jari Kinnunen (right), pictured with Vesa Leppänen. “At some point, we will get to the level where we can model each branch in an individual tree.” Forward drive is what characterises Joensuu’s forest industry cluster as a whole. Examples are not hard to find. Joensuu has the world’s first commercial pyrolysis oil (wood-based fuel) production plant, owned by  . Next door,  ’s Enocell mill is among the pioneers in turning birch into raw material for the textile industry and   is a ground-breaker in the development of energy-efficient material handlers. And this is just the start. Researchers in Joensuu are hard at work to find new ways to use renewable wood-based raw materials across industries ranging from energy to medicine. In particular a great deal of expectation will be placed on photonics (the science of light), which uses lasers and sensors to increase the efficiency of forest industry machinery and processes. “Traditional forest engineering, nanotechnology, photonics and ICT all have areas of confluence which are being combined in new ways,” says Tapio Kinnunen. “Furthermore, the amount of information moving across the entire wood processing chain grows constantly. I can’t even guess where this will lead, but the changes have already started.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/turku-pushes-boat-maritime-innovation/,Turku pushes boat out for maritime innovation,"Finland’s former capital city Turku boasts hundreds of years of maritime industry expertise. But this is not a city stuck in the past: it is a leading centre for shipbuilding innovation and the autonomous future of marine traffic. Turku is ideally positioned for the maritime industry. Located at the mouth of the Baltic Sea, the city is surrounded by an archipelago of some 20 000 islands and skerries. Over the last 300 years it has spawned a booming maritime ecosystem. The behemoth in residence is shipbuilder  , with 1 800 employees and a shipyard that dwarfs its surroundings. It is a buzzing village of gigantic cranes, the hum of welding and people in safety jackets biking around in haste. Right now, its backdrop is dominated by the body of a massive cruise liner under construction. Walk the yard and it is easy to believe Meyer Turku has made its name building some of the world’s largest cruise ships, car-passenger ferries and special vessels. But it has also made inroads in complex, innovative and environmentally friendly construction techniques, including the first diesel-electric cruise ship and the first cruise ship to be fitted solely with outside cabins. “The first priority for us is the safety of our ships,” says Kari Sillanpää, head of R&D at Meyer Turku. “Many technologies developed around autonomous shipping will support that.” “We have built modern cruise ships since the 1970s and every ship series we have launched has introduced new features,” explains  , head of R&D at Meyer Turku. While now owned by German Meyer Family, the history of Meyer Turku dates back to the 1730s. These days shipbuilding is quite a different kettle of fish. Sillanpää talks about the importance of simulations, virtual doubles of its ships and the addition of artificial intelligence (AI) into its processes. Then there is the industry’s ultimate goal: autonomous, self-navigating ships. Those worried about boarding a Caribbean cruise without a crew can rest assured, this is not what Meyer has in mind. “From our perspective, an autonomous ship doesn’t mean a crewless ship, but one that can be operated in a smarter and safer way,” Sillanpää stresses. “It is easier for the crew to operate a ship when they receive constant support from different systems and data on, for example, the surroundings of the ship.” Meyer Turku is helping in the development of these new systems to bring them together in future ships. The company is also one of the initiators of the  , a private-public Finnish collaboration aimed at operating autonomous maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea by 2025. The One Sea ecosystem combines Finnish expertise in the form of research projects, technological development and policy advocacy. A key initiative is a test area called ‘Jaakko’s Sea’, located near the Turku shore. It is the world’s first open test area for trialling everything from sensor systems to entire autonomous ships in real-world conditions. The area has already raised international interest and the first pilots are expected to start here in spring 2018. Rolls-Royce has focused the development of autonomous shipping technology, like this control room for remotely operated vessels, to Turku. Where self-navigating ships are expected to make their greatest impact is in cargo shipping. In February, technology developed in Turku was used to power the world’s first remotely operated commercial vessel: a tug operating in Copenhagen. Key to this milestone is engineering giant Rolls-Royce. Or, more precisely, the company’s Finnish research and development centre for remote controlled and autonomous ships. It was   to bolster projects like this in early 2017. “A global firm has to look at a region’s competitiveness as a whole and what competencies you can find nearby,” says  , vice president sales and marketing,  . “In Finland, we have two significant factors: a robust ICT cluster and a very strong marine cluster particularly in the Turku region. So many pieces fit together [for our move].” Rolls-Royce’s goals for the new R&D centre are ambitious. Having also joined the One Sea ecosystem, it wants nothing less than global leadership in ship automation systems and it already has many projects cooking. “From a technical perspective, the autonomous side already works well in our simulators. But there are internal criteria we must meet before we integrate it into a moving ship,” Jokioinen says. “The question isn’t who will create the first autonomous ship, but who can operate it one million times in a row without issue.” But Jokioinen is confident this could become a reality faster than many believe. He expects the first commercial autonomous ships to break the waves by the end of 2020 and for it to be equipped with technology built in Turku. A Finnish consortium has based itself at the Turku Repair Yard with the goal of creating Europe’s first sustainable ocean liner demolition industry. Local innovation in the sector doesn’t stop at building and operating ships. A major issue for the industry today comes at the end of the lifecycle: ship dismantling. Most big vessels are taken apart in Asia, where conditions often fail to meet EU standards. Still, no EU-state currently offers a permanent dismantling site for large ships. And this is where a new Turku-based ‘ship recycling’ consortium has ideas. It plans to create Europe’s first sustainable ocean liner dismantling and recycling industry in Finland. At the core of the consortium is   (TRY), the largest dry dock in Northern Europe. It acts as the platform for ship recycling, while its consortium-partners  ,   and   acquire the vessels for demolition, handle the extraction of liquid waste and do the mechanical dismantling respectively. The consortium’s first pilot project was executed in October on a mid-sized vessel. “Ultimately, we want to focus on larger ships, but the project was designed to teach us about our strengths and weaknesses,” says  , project manager at TRY. “Now we understand how existing dismantling techniques should be developed forward. That is the next step.” The consortium is already eyeing new vessels the size of ocean liners for a second pilot in 2018. The companies hope the project will eventually provide valuable information to the entire maritime industry and it will partner with Finnish universities to collaborate on this data. “[Shipbuilders] are interested to see what they can learn from our project and apply it when designing ships in the future,” Kangas says. “It will take up to three years of product development before we have a real commercial operation, but as demand for ship recycling is expected grow from 2020 onwards when current ships get older, the timing is good.” For Turku, the prize is its ability to manage a ship’s entire life cycle. It is the culmination of centuries of shipbuilding in the city and the hope is it lays a foundation for the next 300 years as well."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-what-we-learned-at-slush-2017/,Five for Friday: What we learned at Slush 2017,"This year’s Slush was characterised by lasers, politicians, royalty, entrepreneurs and a healthy dose of optimism. Over the past decade,   has developed from a tiny gathering of young entrepreneurs to the hottest high-tech startup conference in the Nordic region. It is the place to be when its soggy and dark outside to make deals and discover what is happening in technology. Here are five exciting things we came across. The tagline for this year’s event was “Nothing normal ever changed a damn thing”. The theme of entrepreneurs and technology altering the world for the better ran throughout the event. Environmentalist, investor and former American Vice President   summed it up with his call to action: “The will to change is a renewable resource.” The Finnish games scene has been thriving for a long time, but it has been characterised by giants   and   and a host of tiny players. Now, finally, it has matured with a group of successful mid-sized companies which have listed on the stock market, including  ,   and   (not to mention Rovio itself, which also went public). This is also good news for the Finnish and Nordic capital markets. Slush has always been about entrepreneurship and innovation, and this is attracting big names. Some multinationals were at Slush to show off their tech, like   and Tesla, but many were trying to meet new potential startup partners, such as   and Airbus. Many countries had a presence at Slush as well, from neighbours like Sweden and Estonia, to more-distant lands of Italy and South Korea. Even royals were interested: both Sweden’s Prince  and Britain’s Prince  managed to stop by and see what’s doing. Finland has gained global recognition for its mobile communications and gaming. Yet today the innovation sphere is much more diverse. Some of the startups in this year’s pitching finals were automation company  , blockchain specialist   and industrial ultrasound experts   – the latter eventually winning Slush100. Meanwhile,  ’s new ring was billed as “the most advanced wearable in the world”, cementing Finnish companies’ position at the forefront of healthtech. The circular economy and cleantech is also brimming with great things in Finland, characterised by innovations such as  ’s cricket-infused bread. Being as the global perception is that Finns are a humble lot, the Slush organisers decided to recruit all of the international guests at the event to brag for us instead. Thus the hashtag #BragForFinland was born. Social media exploded with praise for Finland’s social equity, quality of life and innovations. It didn’t hurt that Finland’s 100th anniversary of independence came just after the event, so even some Finns may have found themselves swelling every so slightly with praise too. Fancy more Slush 2017?  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sailer-films-way-better-businesses/,Sailer films the way to better businesses,"Sailer’s videographic research turns customer insights into a documentary film, compelling companies to listen and act. Traditional customer surveys and market research studies result in PowerPoint presentations or PDF reports. Numbers and graphs are important –   – but they don’t necessarily push to immediate action. CEO and founder Hannu Uotila Finnish   is on course to establishing another way of finding out what customers really think: videographic research. The company not only films interviews, observations and consumer habits, but also presents the results in the form of a documentary. “You can really see the difference,” says founder and CEO  . “When people in top management watch the documentary and discuss it, they instantly start solving problems, recognising quick fixes and understanding what the most pressing issues are.” This is because the video removes the researcher from between the customer and management. Instead of being a number on a piece of paper or a circle graph, there is an authentic person saying what works – and what doesn’t. Uotila has noted that particularly negative feedback tends to get a quick reaction. “That’s our point. When a customer tells almost eye-to-eye that something’s not working, it’s a powerful message to any level in the organisation and it can’t be dealt with just by shrugging shoulders.” Uotila’s background is in video production and business research. Combining the two fields of expertise felt like a no-brainer – especially after he found out that only a handful of companies in the world offer something even remotely similar. Sailer was founded in 2014. The 12 months were spent conceptualising and finding the right direction, but the past two years the winds have been blowing at full speed. Feedback from customers and prospects has been very positive and promising. “Many have wondered why they haven’t come to think of this before,” Uotila mentions. “That really keeps us wanting to push forward, grow and internationalise.” Growth doesn’t mean incontrollable expansion. The team size has stayed moderate, with reliable freelancers contributing to projects when needed. Uotila points out that Sailer is at a point when its reputation is spreading and inquiries are coming in from companies Sailer hasn’t previously targeted. “Although we’re not talking about huge numbers yet, the percentages are impressive,” Uotila explains. The goal is straightforward: in less than a decade, Sailer wants to count its turnover in millions, preferably nearing 10. To achieve this, the company is heading out to foreign markets, beginning with pilot projects in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Sailer office is decorated with a real sailboat. Even if it’s mini-size. Uotila doesn’t see Sailer as a competitor to traditional market research companies. Rather, he deems its service a tool that complements existing methods. “We want to bring video to the palette for researchers and show it adds value and diversifies results. For example, if someone’s conducted a study about customer segments, we can validate it and make it easily representable and comprehensible to employees.” In the future, Sailer is planning to add other types of studies to its offering. For example, finding out customer perspectives prior to launching a new product or service, or mapping employee experience could just as well be done through video. The core idea is always to understand human insight and help implement changes. “We focus on quality instead of quantity,” Uotila says. “Humans aren’t only about numbers. On a scale from one to five, someone’s two might be someone else’s four. We want to develop a profound understanding instead of averages.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/casambi-plans-for-bright-future-with-smart-lighting/,Casambi plans for bright future with smart lighting,"Lighting can affect our mood, alertness and even productivity. Today all you need is a mobile app to make sure you have the right illumination around you.  With the darker days of winter upon us, lighting feels like the perfect topic of discussion.   is more than happy to oblige. The CEO and co-founder of  , Finnish specialists in smart lighting systems, strongly believes that environmental light has the power to change how we work and live. “Lighting has traditionally been kind of accidental,” Pakkala says. “It is always a bit too bright or dark with limited controls. But today, tunable lighting makes it possible to mimic natural light and even change colour temperature based on the weather outside or what someone is doing. We call it lighting that fits the purpose.” Casambi is at the forefront of this revolution with a unique smart lighting control system. It consists of wireless software and hardware components, which are integrated by luminaire manufacturers into their products and used by professionals to create and control lighting environments. The system comes with mobile apps to easily configure and manage these lights. Practical examples of Casambi’s technology can be found in offices, museums, shops and homes across Europe where it is used to create different ambiances and colour scenes. But it can also be used to enhance artwork. For a recent public exhibit in Norway, passers-by were encouraged to use the Casambi app to change the colours of a four-metre-high light installation. Casambi’s smart lighting system lets users control lights and create programmable lighting environments through a mobile app. Where Casambi advantage lies is its use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This is a radio technology found in practically all mobile devices and means lights equipped with Casambi’s components can be controlled directly from any device even without an Internet connection. “If you use any other radio technology, you will need a WiFi network, a router and gateway to connect and control your smart lighting system, which makes it more complex, expensive and less reliable,” Pakkala explains. “We started to develop our low energy system three years before anyone else, and others are only now starting to catch up to this technology.” Like many innovations emerging from up this way, this head start can be traced back to Nokia. Casambi’s founders Pakkala and  got to know BLE while working at the telco giant and founded their own company in 2011 to explore new applications for what was, at the time, a novel technology. “We started the wrong way around,” Pekkala recalls with a laugh. “First we developed our network technology and only then did we look at potential usage cases and realised there was a big change happening in the lighting industry with LEDs. Unlike traditional bulbs, it’s easy to integrate smart technology into LEDs.” In hindsight Casambi picked the right path. Six years on, the company has established an extensive client and partner network in Europe and is now eyeing the US market with its first local sales representatives in place. While Casambi has shown a knack for being ahead of its competition, its next bet is looking to capitalise on a new trend. The company is working with the afore-mentioned tunable light: luminaires which dynamically adjust their colour temperature to mimic the natural light outside. For example, during daytime brighter tones increase alertness and in evenings a more yellowish tint can help improve the supply of melatonin to the body. “If you have tunable, smart lights you can use timers or sensors to programme them based on the amount of light outside,” Pakkala explains. “Tunable lights are an upcoming trend particularly in companies which are interested in their ambiance or the wellbeing and productivity of employees.” While Pakkala shies away from long-term visions of the lighting industry’s future, there is one area where he sees great potential for Casambi: the Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT involves connected networks of all types of devices and machines embedded with sensors collecting vast amounts of data, the light infrastructure that already exists once again gives the company a head-start. In fact, Pakkala believes it could act as the perfect platform for the expansion of IoT. “Lighting will have a central role in IoT because all these sensors need to be put somewhere,” he enthuses. “Lights have electricity to power the sensors and they already exist everywhere there are people. It is only starting now, but it is going to be a huge trend and our system is ready.” “At first we had a consumer focus because as newcomers we didn’t really understand the professional lighting market,” Timo Pakkala says. “But over the years our focus has shifted towards lighting designers and light manufacturers.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/screenful-delves-data-deliver-meaning/,Screenful delves into data to deliver meaning,"The less transparent a project is, the more likely it is to fail. Helping to unmuddy the water is Finnish startup Screenful, whose visual dashboard keeps every team member in the loop.  In 2013,   founder had grown tired of the rigidness of traditional business intelligence systems. In order to source analytics data, he says, one needs deep system integrations to define various metrics and create a dashboard to access all of this information. Still, in Linnanvuo’s experience, the result has often been an expensive project with an end-product that is cumbersome to use. “We started to think there must be an easier way to obtain the analytics,” he says. “We came up with the idea, ‘What if we could produce ready-made dashboards for specific target groups?’ The only thing the users would need to do is give us access to their data sources. In return they would get a visually appealing dashboard, which provides information crucial to their type of operations.” Two years of product development later, the Screenful business analytics dashboard was launched. The plug-and-play cloud service turns numbers and metrics into visual, actionable data for project teams and their stakeholders. This means that they can easily track project progress and react to any potential issues. “Numbers alone don’t lead to change. You need to act based on the numbers and for that to happen, the information needs to be visible,” Linnanvuo explains. “We dig up the information, calculate the metrics and can make it all visible also on big TV screens on the office walls for everybody to see.” Screenful has found its niche. Today the service has over 250 customers, from startups to big corporations, in 40 countries, including big game software developer Unity Technologies and Finnish telco giant  . Screenful’s business analytics dashboard is used in 40 countries to track and monitor product development projects. Screenful might sound like a project management tool to the uninitiated, but Linnanvuo stresses this is far from the case. It provides a visual analytics layer on top of them instead. In fact, Screenful comes integrated with project tools GitHub, Jira, Pivotal Tracker and Trello, which are all popular with the startup’s primary target group of software developers. “There are plenty of companies that focus on sales and marketing analytics, but there is much less competition in production analytics, which we’re focused on,” Linnanvuo says. What has come as a surprise to Screenful in particular is its pull in the US. About 40 per cent of the service’s users are located across the pond, with the UK following closely behind. Linnanvuo laughs that the Helsinki-based startup actually has fewer customers in its home country. This is made possible by Screenful’s close relationship with the aforementioned project management tools. They feature the service in their marketplace and invite the startup to participate in their events. The company received a particular boost in 2016 when it commenced cooperation with Trello, which in turn enabled access to the service’s one million daily users. Screenful, which has a staff of five, has also taken an international approach to its recruitment. The company has two software developers in Yerevan, Armenia, and a local salesperson in Berlin scouting the German market. Next the startup plans to increase its reseller network throughout the Europe and in the US. But Screenful’s primary focus remains on product development. Linnanvuo would like to expand the dashboard to cover products analytics as well and improve software companies’ understanding of their users and he believes there is plenty of work to do. “We are not looking for a fast exit,” Linnanvuo emphasises. “Business analytics was relevant 20 years ago and it will be relevant 20 years from now. We are in this for the long term.” “Our operations are mostly online and Finland is a great place for this kind of global business,” says Sami Linnanvuo (right). “We have good services for startups, like Tekes [Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation], and the price level is lower than in Silicon Valley.”"

Having developed the fastest growing Open Source database, this company landed backing of 25 million euros from EIB in May. The fattening of wallet will help accelerate expansion of the product’s capabilities, along with feature development in future. “This funding is part of a multi-step strategy to strengthen MariaDB across Europe, America and Asia, and will help foster the next phase of growth for the company,”    , CEO of MariaDB Corporation. After creating medicine dispensing robots that assist with home care daily work, this Salo-based healthtech firm then received a 21.2-million-euro boost from Norwegian investment company Serendipity Partners to further their development in December. Along with the obvious business benefits, the company seeks to underline the importance of this improved cash flow for home work customers and families. “More and more people will have a chance to enjoy better medical care, and we can help hard-working home care staff to do their work even better,”   company CEO  . “Also, [the] public sector will see benefits as better care can be provided with less costs.” Having surpassed one billion US dollars in annual ad spend on Facebook earlier this year, this ad optimisation solution provider also gathered a nifty amount of 20 million US dollars in funding in September. “Everyone is an owner at Smartly.io and a secondary round was a way for us to reward the entire team and take off any pressure to sell or IPO,”   CEO and founder  , “We, in return, gained a partner that will help us take our business to the next level through their network, by helping us build out a global leadership team and with access to a large fund if we ever need capital for acquisitions or more aggressive expansion. This Helsinki-based digital company received a 20-million-US dollar funding boost in August from investors in Canada, Switzerland and Finland. A significant part of this capital injection was used to finalise its acquisition of the Finnish   creators Sumoing. Now it has assumed the post of the global leader of colouring book applications, with a focus on apps tailored to a female audience. The company “also intends to use the funds to invest in several new app vendors,”  , adding that back in the summer it had “also managed to bring in   and   as brand partners”. Also in August, Finnish SAR microsatellite company ICEYE raised an additional 13 million euros towards scaling up operations and the planned launch of three microsatellites equipped with SAR technology. “Having the support and insight from our investors will not only help ICEYE execute on our vision to democratise access to data worldwide, but it will also allow us to build out brand-new capabilities for our customers and partners,”  , CEO and co-founder, ICEYE."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/heltti-s-digital-healthcare-solution-takes-flight/,Heltti’s digital healthcare solution takes flight,"Finnish health services provider Heltti believes the future of healthcare is digital, personalised and preventative. The online doctor is ready to see you.  The moment you knock on the door at   clinic in central Helsinki, it comes clear this is no traditional healthcare center. You are greeted at the door and taken to a cosy café-like area to enjoy a beverage while waiting for your appointment. Surgery rooms are replaced with ‘meeting rooms’, patients are called ‘members’ and there is a distinct lack of white coats. But Heltti’s mission to redefine occupational healthcare services goes deeper than inviting exteriors. In fact, many of the meeting rooms sit empty as already 76 per cent of Heltti’s patients manage their health issues remotely via a secure chat or call with a nurse or a doctor. “We are changing the way people think about visiting a doctor, the disruption is similar to what has happened in banking,” describes  , CEO and co-founder of Heltti. “Going to the doctors can mean picking up your smartphone and using a digital connection.” In practice, this means all of Heltti’s patient contact starts with a remote care assessment. If the patient describes something as simple as cold symptoms, a nurse can give them treatment instructions and sick leave right there and then. For Lappi this is a win-win situation: fast, efficient and no need for a health centre visit. “We believe healthcare shouldn’t aim for as many patient visits as possible, but for finding the most effective ways to treat people and prevent illnesses,” he says. The idea for Heltti dates back to 2012 when Lappi noticed occupational healthcare is still largely based on manual labour and industrial companies. When co-founders   and  jumped on board, the trio created a plan for what modern healthcare services for knowledge workers could look like. We are changing the way people think about visiting a doctor; the disruption is similar to what has happened in banking. The first Heltti clinic was opened in Helsinki two years later. The company started by turning the traditional model of charging for each appointment and treatment separately upside down and introduced healthcare packages based on monthly fixed fees instead. “It is the model of ancient Chinese village doctors. Instead of the sick paying, the healthy villagers pay the doctor,” Lappi explains. “This way the doctor has an incentive to keep the villagers healthy and not only focus on treating the sick.” Heltti has transferred this approach to the 21st century with the help of digital tools. For example, all its ‘members’ complete regular digital health surveys so any underlying health or lifestyle issues can be detected early. Today the company has seven clinics in Finland, staff of 44 employees and close to 400 customer companies with a total of 6 000 employees. There are also plans for new locations and expanding the model to other Nordic markets, which will be needed if Heltti is to reach its ambitious goal of 100 000 members by 2020. A crucial part of Heltti’s preventative approach is data. A growing number of people track their health data through smart watches, step counters and other wearables, but healthcare professionals rarely see the data. Not for long, says Lappi. “We have already done this through another system, but now we are building our own digital health management system capable of aggregating health data,” he explains. “In future if someone gets less active and their sleep quality deteriorates, this could turn on ‘a red light’ for our staff and they could reach out to ask if everything is okay.” In October, Heltti closed its second funding round: 440 000 euros. Led by Nokia chairman  company First Fellow Partners, this was targeted specifically to develop this kind of a digital customer experience further. Others are following suit. Lappi pinpoints digitalisation and remote treatment as the biggest trends in healthcare today. In occupational healthcare he believes companies’ focus will shift to seeing employee wellbeing as a competitive advantage and a crucial investment, instead of counting sick days and healthcare costs. But no matter the direction the industry takes in the next decade or two, Lappi is confident data is at the core of it. “There will be ever more data collected from people and smarter ways to support their wellbeing. Artificial intelligence (AI) could spot cold symptoms early and advise you to take it easy for a couple of days,” he predicts. “Eventually AI might know people better than we do.” “In future occupational healthcare will be measured in new ways,” Timo Lappi explains. “Instead of costs or sick leave days, the focus will be on measuring employees’ energy levels, productivity, life expectancy.”"

CEO Kari Laurila In the morning of the deadline for accepting the package, Laurila started to wonder what the life of an entrepreneur would be like.

First, he just had to ring his wife. “She gave me the green light and I told my boss about my decision, stayed at work for six more months and that was it,” Laurila recalls. Then he turned into the founder, owner and CEO of  , nicknamed TAZ. The three words in TAZ’s name reflect the core idea: it’s about   in   in a particular location (so,  ). “TAZ combines teamwork with technology and location services and adds elements of gaming,” Laurila explains. The firm’s first product was known as FlagHunt. The software enabled a flaghunt game in the event organiser’s choice of location, taking advantage of the participants’ geographical information. In 2011, TAZ landed The Finnish Quality Innovation Award for its GPS-based innovations. “We’ve taken part in three competitions and won them all,” Laurila tells. “So, competition-wise, we’re doing alright.” However, FlagHunt was only the beginning. Soon Laurila and his team realised that it’s not ideal to offer a fixed product; a much better option would be to create a platform on which customers can create and customise their own experiences. “FlagHunt is a game that makes people run and sweat, so it doesn’t suit all events,” Laurila says. “Based on feedback, we began to develop a tool that would enable making all kinds of games.” As of 2012, TAZ has focused exclusively on the platform known as ActionTrack, trying to make it as generic and easy-to-use as possible. It’s targeted at corporate events, education, destination services and marketing. An unexpected push to business came from the global hit game  . Laurila points out that since the idea of location-based augmented reality games has now gone mainstream, the idea is much easier to explain – and monetise. “Gamification is a huge trend, and ActionTrack makes it available to everyone,” Laurila says. “For example, teachers and education service providers can use it in teaching, resorts and hotels can develop activities for guests, and employees can make their workshops more engaging by turning it into a team game.” ActionTrack gives the tools, the creator of the game just needs imagination. So far, Laurila hasn’t regretted bidding farewell to the life of a steady pay cheque. So far, TAZ has had B2B licensees in more than 50 countries, and it’s expanding its coverage primarily through global partners. “We could sell our next license to Sweden but we might as well sell it to Costa Rica,” notes Laurila, who’s just been on the phone to New Zealand. “We’ve got no predetermined steps or preferences, we just go wherever the global competition takes us.” The goal is to let TAZ’s team focus on product development and let sales happen through partners and other channels. At the moment, 72 per cent of sales come from abroad, and the share is ever growing. What helps in spreading the word is that TAZ takes all kinds of customers into account in its offering. TAZ is able to offer turnkey games and model templates as well as just the most basic tools that leave the user with all possibilities to customise the end result according to their liking. The same principle applies to licensing: soon even an individual consumer can buy a license to organise a turnkey game at a birthday party, with other options ranging all the way to unlimited usage with an annual fee. There’s a bigger picture to all of it, too. For Laurila as an entrepreneur, values matter. He’s been thrilled to hear that ActionTrack-based tools have helped motivate pupils in schools and made people move instead of sitting at their desks. “We want to offer something that can increase the sense of community and help people exercise,” he says. “This our contribution to better health, fun learning and encouraging creativity.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/childrens-education-kide-science/,Finnish innovation has children’s education down to a science,"A science academy that ignites the spark children have for learning – Kide Science is an idea that could only come from Finland. Now, it’s in demand all over the world. Mum, where do rainbows come from? Dad, why are some flowers yellow and some blue? Uncle, why do carrots go soft when they’re boiled? The questions children pose can sometimes be baffling – and very difficult. Yet still, the worst possible answer is to tell them to stop wondering. “Children are natural-born researchers and investigators,” says  . “However, if they’re not encouraged, they can lose interest in asking questions.” Making use of children’s instinct to wonder and ponder is at the heart of Kide Science’s philosophy. Hurme-Mehtälä is the CEO and co-founder of  , a company that has set out to teach science to those as young as three. Its aim isn’t to make all children physicists or biologists; instead, it wants to embrace children’s natural curiosity and nourish it. “If kids are told to stop asking questions from an early age, the intrigue they have for their surroundings might die out and school can feel like a chore,” Hurme-Mehtälä explains. “But if, instead, they’re taught how to figure things out themselves, they find studying rewarding.” This is helpful not only to children, their parents and educators, but also society in general. Learning an inquiry-based approach helps to raise the problem-solvers of the future. “The world around us is changing rapidly, and kids need to be prepared for whatever the coming years might bring. If they learn to respect nature and understand its causes and effects, they’re likely to be interested in knowing how to protect the Earth and act accordingly.” Kide Science’s academies are based on a doctoral dissertation by  , one of the company’s founders. In order to conduct her research, she needed to organise science clubs for small children. Once the study was completed, both parents and kids had grown so fond of the academy that they wanted to continue with it. That’s when Hurme-Mehtälä and   stepped in, and the company was founded. Kide Science wants learning to be fun and motivating. The first commercial endeavours took place in Helsinki last year. As the academies proved increasingly popular, the trio had to think about ways of scaling their business. Soon they partnered with Finnish daycare provider Touhula, which has over 150 kindergartens around Finland. On top of its core business, Kide Science has published a book, created a television show for kids in collaboration with Finnish broadcasting company Yle and welcomed a fourth owner,  , on board. The next big plans lie outside of the home country’s borders. Now, Kide Science is about to send one of its team members to Peru, where local institutions will be adopting the Finland-born model. Colombia is next in line, and hopefully the rest of Latin America will follow. Other Nordic markets are of interest, and requests have been heard from China, Dubai and Belgium, too. The business model will be adopted to suit each market, be it franchising, partnerships or simply teacher trainings. Hurme-Mehtälä admits laughingly that they’re not always even sure where parents and teachers have heard about them. “Often it seems to be because we’re from Finland, which is known for its high level of education, and has up-to-date academic research to back our method with.” If responding to enquiries flooding in wasn’t enough work, Kide Science is also on the brink of piloting a digital product that provides learning materials for both schools and individual consumers. The storyline is the same: a character travelling between two universes guides children in experiments. The goal is to help kids understand that the world is indeed full of wonders – but most of them comprehensible. This is conveyed in the company’s name too. It combines three words: kid,   (idea in Swedish) and   (crystal in Finnish). “For example, water molecules form ice crystals when they freeze, and explaining this process to a child can be a crystallising experience!” Hurme-Mehtälä points out – pun intended.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-finnish-proverbs/,Five for Friday: Finnish proverbs,"This week, our Five for Friday takes a slightly more light-hearted approach than usual. We’re taking a look at traditional Finnish sayings that startup entrepreneurs might find useful in their endeavours. All languages and cultures have their own proverbs and sayings that can, at first glance, seem inexplicable. Although sometimes they stem from times that hardly resonate with the modern mind, often the seed of wisdom they carry is applicable to today’s world. We at   collected a set of five traditional proverbs that could function as reminders to business founders as they embark on the challenging – yet often rewarding – journey of entrepreneurship. Here you go! There’s an abundance of noise in this world, and often those who should stay quiet make up for the vast majority of the sounds. Business owners should be wary of whom to listen to, be it words of advice, encouragement or resentment – and whom to leave aside, despite their decibels. Today’s big business players weren’t always that big – we’ve all got to start somewhere. Feeling small amongst the giants is natural, but knowing the stories behind them can be inspiring. Planting a tiny seed can lead to a huge oak, not in a heartbeat, but with hard work and under favourable circumstances. When one takes up something big and works hard for it, there will be people who try to get the credit or otherwise benefit from those efforts. For entrepreneurs, this serves as a note to self: don’t ignore intellectual property rights, patents or anything that protects you from being taken advantage of by opportunists. This isn’t to say one should be overly protective of one’s accomplishments, just that credit needs to be given where the credit is due. If one is too greedy, things won’t end well. Trying to maximise profit, taking unnecessarily big risks or simply only going for one’s own good isn’t a sustainable business strategy. Taking others into account, focusing on stable progress instead of quick wins and acting sustainably sounds like a much better strategy, and the end is less likely to be faeces-infested. Turku is a city in the southwest of Finland, and it’s often a target of crude jokes (for no reason, if you ask us). This proverb means that if it’s something you don’t need, in other words ‘empty’, you will get it for free anywhere, including a place like Turku. In order to create a product or service that can be monetised, it needs to have value, meaning and use. If nobody needs it, nobody buys it."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/oceans-of-opportunity-for-norsepower-s-cleantech/,Oceans of opportunity for Norsepower’s cleantech,"This clean technology and marine engineering company has patented a mechanical sail allowing vessels to harness wind power, cutting both costs and carbon footprint.  ’s office lies by a straight of water running between the Helsinki neighbourhoods of Lauttasaari and Ruoholahti. This forms a fitting backdrop for CEO   as he muses on the topic of ship propulsion – something that he has been discussing a lot recently. Altogether, the   has received around 10 million euros in funding for its Norsepower Rotor Sail Solution, which has modernised the Flettner Rotor. Harnessing wind power to create forward propulsion, these cylindrical sails allow a ship’s main engines to be throttled back. They can be used with new vessels or retrofitted to existing ships. As a result of this forward motion, the solution also enables freight ships to reduce fuel and emissions. The latter is one of the main factors that drew Riski to the project in the first place; a positive environmental impact for an industry that has traditionally been considered far from spotless. “This is cleantech at its cleanest,” he says. “The technology’s potential to reduce an industry’s total carbon emissions is simply staggering.” Tuomas Riski points to the simplicity of the idea as a reason for Norsepower’s success: “We set out knowing how to go about making a mechanical sail.” Given all this talk of propulsion, it’s fitting that the business has been moving at a considerable pace. It took Riski and his team two years following the founding of the company in 2012 to make the prototype. Only two months into its existence, Norsepower had secured a contract to test out its technology on ship company Bore’s M/S Estraden vessel, a 9 700 DWT roll-on/roll-off carrier. “Shipping is a conservative, risk-averse industry,” Riski explains. “We needed to prove that at the very least, the prototype wouldn’t cause them any harm.” Modernising the Flettner Rotor meant making it as light, balanced, and aerodynamic as possible. In that vein, Norsepower developed production methods, composites and automation technology, ensuring the sail needs little attention from the crew during a journey. “We’ve gotten pretty much all of the elements of the sail patented,” Riski recounts. Following the installation of the prototype and the subsequent third-party verified  , Finnish shipping company Bore ordered a second spinning sail for the M/S Estraden, which bodes well for the response within the shipping industry. Installations due to take place this year include a 24-metre rotor sail for Swedish cruise company Viking Line’s Grace ship, and two 30-metre rotor sails for a Maersk tanker. With M/S Estraden’s two rotor sails cutting fuel costs by over six per cent, stemming 1 200 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, the potential cumulative effect across a market of 20 000 cargo ships is indeed simply staggering. All of this has not gone unnoticed. ​Norsepower was pinpointed by   as one of the  . The industry has also sat up and paid attention. The company has been recognised with a number of accolades in recent times, with Riski also the recipient of Nor-Shipping’s 2017 Young Entrepreneur Award “This is just the beginning for what we hope will be the start of a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable shipping industry,”  . “Norsepower is proud to be playing its part in contributing to this vision.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bcaster-monetises-media-smart-copyright-protection/,BCaster monetises your media with smart copyright protection,"BCaster ticks all the right buzzwords: artificial intelligence (AI), copyright management, fake news and video. But the Finnish tech startup promises its new mobile platform for sharing and protecting our content online is more than just buzz. Has a news outlet ever asked to use your Twitter video clip for free or have you found your Instagram photo published on a random website? There are countless examples of social media content being used online without proper compensation or even permission. And the problem is only growing. “Today everyone produces a lot of data, photos and video,” explains  ,   founder. “Data is said to be the currency of the future. But at the moment people are giving away valuable data for free to companies who know how to monetise it.” BCaster believes its AI-powered mobile media platform can turn the situation around. Let’s say you capture a major accident on your phone. You upload the video to the BCaster app where it is automatically analysed, priced and embedded with copyright information. A journalist looking for footage of the accident can easily find your video based on its time and place and purchase the usage rights with a few clicks. “Our AI makes the whole process fast. When you take a photo or video [using our app] it can be found in our search engine within seconds,” Neuvonen says. “In that time our AI has dug out what or who is in the picture, where it was taken and when.” It sounds like a win-win situation. The content owner is fairly compensated (BCaster takes a small slice of the fee) and the media, or any company in need of video and photo material, gets to beef up their coverage without risking copyright infringement. BCaster took a long time to take shape. Neuvonen first got the idea six years ago when he saw a TV crew desperately trying to find someone who filmed an accident at a Finnish rally event. “I thought what if we had a media service which can analyse where something has happened and offer time-and-place connected content from everyone there,” Neuvonen recalls. “The production team wouldn’t have to run around a forest, they could look on the app where things are happening and buy the footage they want.” We want to ensure no one loses the copyright to their content without being paid for it. But it wasn’t until 2016 the idea really took off. Neuvonen found two co-founders,   and  , participated in an accelerator programme and raised 600 000 euros of funding from private investors and   to kick-off BCaster. This was used to build an early version of the app, which BCaster tested at events around Finland. Encouraged by the positive response, in November 2017 the startup turned to crowdfunding to speed up product development. It was the right decision. “We started the campaign on a Friday evening, and when I woke up on Saturday morning  . In less than 20 hours. We had to stop the campaign there,” Neuvonen says and laughs. Now BCaster is gearing up for its next moment of truth. Its media platform will be launched internationally at the South by Southwest festival in Texas in March. The startup has a topical pitch particularly for the US market. In addition to copyright protection, the BCaster app uses blockchain technology to verify all content and to detect if anything is faked or manipulated. The company is also patenting a content protection technology which makes it impossible to remove copyright information from a file without damaging it. If it takes off, it could mean trying times for movie pirates. But first BCaster’s full focus is on the everyday consumer: “We want to ensure no one loses the copyright to their content without being paid for it,” Neuvonen stresses. “Every person creates valuable content and we want to be an advocate for them.” “At the moment it is very easy to misuse and manipulate photos and videos. But we can analyse them based on data from other content taken in the same place at the same time and verify the content,” says Janne Neuvonen (fourth from left)."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/self-love-cupoftherapy-please/,"Some self-love and a CupOfTherapy, please","Every now and then, we all need a reminder to be a little gentler to ourselves. Finnish company CupOfTherapy shares encouragement, humour and comfort through heart-warming illustrations. The illustrated card by   is a good-natured slap in the face to all of us who think our worth is measured in how much we get done. Its purpose is not to judge or give orders as such; instead, it wants to fuel its viewer’s own thought processes. “CupOfTherapy is all about making the mind’s landscapes visible,” explains co-founder, psychotherapist  . “The animal characters offer something anyone anywhere in the world can relate to, provoking emotions and discussions.” The drawings can be seen and shared both online and off. CupOfTherapy is a growing series of drawings by award-winning illustrator and graphic designer  . The pictures spread online, for example through CupOfTherapy’s  , and they’re also printed on products like t-shirts, calendars and a deck of cards. Their messages are encouraging people to notice and admit feelings without shame and discomfort. “Our aim is to normalise mental health and wellbeing as well as lower the threshold of talking about sensitive issues,” Rehmonen says. “Each drawing evokes different reactions in different people, and that’s why they can be used in all kinds of settings, be it with a partner in private or a meeting with a psychotherapist.” She emphasises the importance of listening to one’s inner self. “A feeling always carries a message we should listen to. If you never stop to wonder where the emotion stems from, you won’t know what’s holding back your happiness.” As a company, CupOfTherapy was founded by Rehmonen, fellow psychotherapist   and illustrator Pikkujämsä. The animal figures are all by Pikkujämsä, who draws inspiration from various sources, such as vintage picture books and textile and ethnic design. The concise phrases boil down to what it is to be human, yet still, the portraits are of animals. To Pikkujämsä, this makes all the sense in the world. “Animals help us tell things that would seem awkward or even angsty if we used human characters,” he points out. “An animal is simultaneously distant yet easy to approach. A lot of people also have a favourite animal.” “Facilitating better mental health is a cause that’s easy to support,” says Elina Rehmonen (right). Rehmonen is in charge of running the practicalities of the company. She’s the one who pushed Pikkujämsä and Ervasti to follow through with their idea that started out as a few simple Instagram posts – but led to three big publishing houses in Finland wanting to turn CupOfTherapy into a book. “I knew a lot could come out of it,” Rehmonen says, “but Antti and Matti were being too shy and modest. I insisted we’ve got the let the whole world know!” A proof of the universality of the concept is that CupOfTherapy has raised interest in various corners of the world. Particularly keen are the Japanese, where CupOfTherapy books have been ordered by MUJI BOOKS – in Finnish. Other intriguing international collaborations are coming up, too. Rehmonen says that CupOfTherapy hasn’t had trouble finding partners. Anyone they’ve approached has been happy to join the movement. “Facilitating better mental health is a cause that’s easy to support,” she mentions. “On top of that, the high-quality products are made sustainably and are Finnish design.” That’s not everything. CupOfTherapy is also involved in charitable projects in schools and with NGOs, and it claims to donate 10 per cent of its profits to mental health work. Rehmonen reveals that the percentage is far from accurate. “You can forget about the 10 per cent. So far, we’ve donated pretty much everything we’ve received. As a startup, our margins aren’t huge, but we want to contribute as much as we can.” CupOfTherapy cards can be used by everyone at work and home to encourage understanding and interaction even when words are difficult to find."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/altum-finds-sonic-solution-to-global-pollution/,Altum finds sonic solution to global pollution,"Fouled industrial equipment is a costly business. Not only does cleaning it require production stoppages, but the extra energy required to run it equals the emissions from over 200 million cars, or 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions. Now a Finnish innovation could provide a sound solution. No hoovers or mops are on sight here. The speciality of Helsinki-based   is removing clogged up dirt (in other words, ‘fouling’) in industrial processes and heat exchangers. But instead of using mechanical tools or hazardous chemicals, Altum has harnessed something less invasive and more efficient for the job: ultrasound. “The currently used cleaning methods are mechanical and chemical washes. But both require the machinery to be stopped, which means they are out of productive use for hours or even days,” explains  , CEO at Altum. “With our system, all you need is our externally attached ‘power ultrasound’ device. It emits high-power ultrasonic waves into the machinery, which break up fouling without any production stoppages.” This might not seem revolutionary, but for a big company the annual savings of reduced downtime and improved energy efficiency could amount to millions of euros. Furthermore, the whole process can be done in a few minutes and remotely controlled with Altum’s software. The company’s power ultrasound devices are externally attached to industrial equipment and emit focused, high-power ultrasound waves where cleaning is needed. The sound waves break up and disperse fouling. Behind Altum’s technology is good old customer demand. Tainela and co-founder   have worked with ultrasound cleaning equipment since 2012, but saw their customers increasingly request more production-friendly alternatives. After futile searches for suitable technology globally, the duo decided to take the matter into their own hands. “We knew we couldn’t do it alone and had to get smarter brains involved. In 2015, I called a dozen of universities and most recommended I contact   [professor of physics] at the University of Helsinki,” Tainela recalls. This ended up being precisely what the duo needed. Haeggström and his team specialise in soundwaves and came up with a unique technology for controlling power ultrasound. In May 2016, Altum was founded and raised funding from Business Finland (then Tekes) and Lifeline Ventures. A year later, Altum launched the first six power ultrasound devices capable of cleaning any liquid carrying equipment, such as reactors, tanks and cooling towers. Since then the devices have been used by 20 customers in Finland, and the company has struck its first international deals in Sweden and Central Europe. International expansion is now firmly in Altum’s sights. In particular Europe, China and the US are markets the company has sounded out with promising results. “Some [of the interested parties] are technology providers that want to integrate our solution into theirs, some are local multi-industry service companies and then there are also end-users who have contacted us directly,” Tainela enthuses. Altum also continues its close collaboration with the University of Helsinki, from where the bulk of its 15 staff originate. The company already has new concepts under development targeted at reducing emissions and the use of chemicals in the process industry. In future, Altum says its ultrasound technology could be used to purify water, clean soil and eliminate bacteria in waste among many others. But the company already has a lot on its plate. Given the scale of the problems caused by fouling in industrial equipment, Tainela says cleaning it is a market estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of euros globally. “We would be happy with a 10 billion share of that,” he concludes, with a laugh. Altum’s power ultrasound technology is the first in the world to clean industrial equipment without halting production."

Whilst brick and mortar retail is far from dead, there’s no denying the ease of purchase with the click of a mouse or tap of the finger. This quintet of Finnish companies are leading the charge in facilitating eCommerce on a grander scale. One-person businesses tend to be up to their eyes with work, even without the hassle of coding and hosting their own online store. Vilkas wants to give them a digital hand, by allowing any enterprise to open its own online store instantly simply by creating an account and logging in. “It’s a do-it-yourself platform that’s as easy to use and navigate as possible,” CEO    . “With it, business owners don’t need the skills or the technology to create a global webshop from scratch.” These days, we can buy something from an Italian online store or sell something to Germany as easily as doing business with the shop down the street.

Frosmo improves the user experience by personalising websites to meet a specific customer’s need. its platform also streamlines the purchase process, so that swapping between devices doesn’t mean the user needs to start over again. “Software development is becoming simpler and faster,” CEO  . “Instead of heavy and lengthy projects, the focus is on coming up with more efficient and straightforward approaches and browser-based solutions.” Shopping online can sometimes be frustrating. Is one product better than the other? Why does this cost more than that? Where do I find information about delivery costs? Finnchat is here to help, with its real-time chat solution. “The core idea was that although business is moving online, shopping doesn’t need to be all technology,”  , company CEO,  . “In a normal store, there’s always a person asking if the customer needs assistance. We figured this would be doable online as well.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/horsehair-gold-nanna-salmi/,Horsehair is gold for Nanna Salmi,"Finnish textile designer Nanna Salmi helps horse lovers carry a piece of their dearest animal partner with them everywhere, including the fanciest of occasions. Nanna Salmi was standing next to a horse – horrified. Previously, she had only seen horses from afar and in movies, and from up close, the animal seemed to be the size of a mountain. How would she ever be able to sit on its back when it’s  ? What if she falls or loses control? Salmi had always thought about trying horse riding, but only got around to it when she, nearing 40, received a riding lesson as a birthday gift. However, the one lesson planted a seed of enthusiasm, and Salmi found herself returning to the stables again and again. The elderly mare, her first horse contact, was the best teacher she could have imagined. “She tried showing me that if I don’t tell her what to do, she’ll do whatever she wants,” Salmi recalls. “That boosted my persistence. I didn’t want the horse to make a fool out of me!” That’s when it happened: Salmi started riding the horse instead of just sitting on it. “I felt like the mare thought: finally!” Pretty soon, Salmi bought the mare for herself. In the years to come, the two developed a relationship in which both fully trusted each other. “I think that’s what’s so fascinating about horses,” Salmi ponders. “It’s an incredible feeling to have that trust between an animal and a human. You can’t control an animal that size with mere power; other things matter much more.” The love some people have for horses can be difficult to explain. To Salmi, the secret lies in the interaction between two very different beings. Salmi’s first encounter with horses took place back in the 1980s. After the mare passed away, she spent a year looking for another horse, struggling to find one that really left an impression. Then she found a three-year-old Finnhorse, with whom she continued to live a horse-filled life. In 1999, she had an idea. The owner of the stable her horse was living in had a milestone birthday coming up, and she, together with other horse owners, was pondering what to give her as a gift. Salmi, who as a textile designer knew all kinds of weaving techniques, heard herself saying: maybe I could do something with horse hair? “Everyone agreed, and that was that. I just stood there thinking what on earth I had just promised,” Salmi reminiscences laughingly. She created a ribbon using hair from three generations of horses, turned it into a necklace and found a goldsmith to make a piece of jewellery the shape of an egg-butt snaffle bit. At the party, the birthday lady opened the box, said ‘oh this is nice’ and put it away. One of the ladies ushered her to take another look, saying it’s made of horse hair. ‘Oh, that’s great’ still didn’t suffice as a response. “It’s made of horsehair from your three horses,” the lady shrieked. At last, she got her attention. The gift made its recipient burst into tears – and other people started whispering to Salmi that they want one, too. “That’s when I realised I might’ve created a whole new product.” Fast-forward 20 years, and   jewellery is worn by both little stable girls and hobby riders as well as Olympians and royals. Orders come in from all corners of the world. Salmi emphasises that the pieces of jewelery aren’t just merely fan items for horse lovers. They are genuine design pieces made of valuable materials, handmade according to the customer’s wishes. Metal parts are cast by one of the oldest jewellery casters in Finland, and all gemstones meet international standards. Horse hair is what makes the pieces special. Although occasionally someone wants a jewel made of any horse’s hair, Salmi tells that the vast majority of customers send her the hair they want used. “One product can involve weeks of correspondence to ensure the end result is exactly as the customer imagines it,” she notes. “I understand this, as the item is of such emotional importance to its bearer. Often clients tell me stories about the horse, too.” Salmi no longer has a horse of her own, but recently she has made a comeback to the stables, as her grandchild is now taking lessons. “Last time, I had to get on a horse for a little test ride. Sitting on the saddle just makes me feel like I’ve come home.” Almost all products include horse hair sent to Salmi by the customer."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-meets-success-with-better-bookings/,Finnish startup meets success with better bookings,"In four years, the idea of a 22-year-old Finn has turned into a global business. He did it by shaking up how companies book offsite meeting rooms. In 2014   had had enough. For seven years he had run a successful catering company across Finland, but one thing kept bugging him: the time spent on quote requests. Tailoring replies to every inquiry took time, but typically only 10 per cent led to sales. Ahola’s solution? Move industries and bring the whole process online. “The customer experience is improved when you use an automated online system. Customers don’t have to wait 48 hours for an email reply anymore,” argues Ahola, who founded   the same year. “Our mission is to make booking offsite meeting rooms as easy as booking hotel rooms. Eventually we want to kill off the old-school quote request.” The company is off to a good start. Since launching its meeting space marketplace MeetingPackage.com in September 2016, it has reached an inventory of over 250 000 meeting rooms in 120 countries. They can now be searched, compared and booked online by organisers globally. The service is complemented by a booking engine which meeting venues can embed directly to their websites, and backed by 2.6 million euros in funding. Ahola got hooked on entrepreneurship early on. He started his first company at 14, importing set-top boxes to Finland as part of a young entrepreneurs’ programme. At 16, came the aforementioned catering company and finally MeetingPackage.com. You can learn anything when you put yourself into challenging situations “It was a leap to the unknown, to software. I didn’t have any previous experience with it, but I knew the event industry. And now I can even code,” Ahola, now 26, says with a laugh. “You can learn anything when you put yourself into challenging situations. I always want to take things forward.” The same attitude is applied to MeetingPackage.com. According to Ahola, it is the only booking platform to integrate directly with Oracle’s Opera event management software. This is no small feat, as Opera is used by hotels around the world. Another industry-first is coming in the summer as well when MeetingPackage.com launches dynamic pricing for meeting room bookings. And the industry has taken note. In January 2018, renowned business magazine Forbes picked Ahola for its   European e-commerce and retail disruptors list. “For me, it felt like winning. It affirms we have done something right and our journey is only starting,” Ahola enthuses. “It is a recognition to our whole team, even if it is my face on the list.” MeetingPackage.com is a global marketplace for meeting room bookings. The aim is to save time and money for both meeting organisers and venue providers. It is a team that can be best described as international: 30 employees from 13 different countries. This reflects MeetingPackage.com’s growing global ambitions. The startup already has an office in the UK (although run from Finland) and local ‘ambassadors’ in the Czech Republic and Italy. “We don’t want to be a small Finnish player, but we want to do everything big from the day one,” Ahola explains. “We aim to establish a local presence in France, Germany, Spain and Sweden during the first half of the year.” The latter half of 2018 will focus on setting up operations in Northern America. MeetingPackage.com is moving fast, but it is all part of Ahola’s gameplan. Although the company only has local competitors at the moment, it recognises things change fast in technology: “This is a fast track game, you need to run to stay ahead. That is the goal for all of us, our investors and the team,” Ahola summarises. “We want to disrupt this market globally and be one of the top three meeting services by 2020.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-the-dudesons-discover-mwc18/,Five for Friday: The Dudesons discover #MWC18,"At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week, Finnish stunt group The Dudesons were on hand to bewilder audiences with their antics – and were left pretty gobsmacked themselves by the wonders of Finnish tech.  Roughly 100 000 visitors roamed the endless halls of Barcelona’s Gran Via exhibition complex  , most of them seasoned veterans who can explain the difference between a LPWAN and a regular WLAN with ease. In the midst of all this seasoned tech talk, there were also some rookies to be found. The hosts of the Finland Pavilion, The Dudesons, are known for doing things that others would not try. Yet for all of their much publicised ground-breaking, they had never actually attended the event before. , we decided to sit down with  ,   and  to find out what caught the attention of the fearless trio at their first MWC. The Dudesons are not shy to brag about their home country. Leading up to the event, they immersed themselves in the background of the Finnish companies in attendance. At the Finland Pavilion, they hosted daily pitching sessions, keynotes and evening programmes, following closely what the companies have to say. The experience was enlightening. “It has been eye-opening and exciting to see that so much cool stuff is coming from Finland,” HP says. “These companies have an enormous amount of technology knowhow,” Jarppi comments. “It is truly impressive.” MWC’s slogan of   had a homely tone for The Dudesons. The smart home market of intelligent household appliances and related solutions is expected to grow significantly in the years to come, with Finnish companies front and centre with their innovative offering. “I was trying to check out where we are with smart homes as of now and how they will look like in the future and help you with your everyday life,” says HP. “Like any homeowner, I am interested in stuff like this.” At the event, Finnish company   showcased a wearable IoT device. “What’s so good about that?” you may ask. Well, this one is for man’s best friend. The Dudesons were not the only ones impressed by the smart vest, as the dog-friendly solution became an immediate hit at the Finland Pavilion,  . “Over 20 per cent of European households have a dog,” Jarppi says. “Yet, no one thought about the potential for such a device, until a Finnish guy came up with the idea.” These days, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is understandably one of the major buzzes in the tech industry. Even though the exact definition of AI is still somewhat vague, the forecasts for machine-lead intelligence did not go unnoticed by the Finnish stunt group. “For me, AI is certainly one of the most fascinating things here,” says Jarppi. According to The Dudesons, they have previous experience with conversational AI tech, such as Amazon’s Alexa. Consequently, the group has evident curiosity for potential use cases of voice control and AI. “In my daily life, I spend a lot of time driving,” says HP. “An intelligent voice control that fits with cars and works seamlessly would be of great help.” Even if you have only a passive relationship with tech, the term ‘digital transformation’ has probably caught your attention. The invasion of digital technologies on all layers of human action is transforming our societies, without any slowdown in sight. The Dudesons did notice this. “The pace is outstanding with new tech,” comments Jarno. “Finland should definitely try to be a forerunner in this development by ensuring an environment that enables and supports new innovations.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wellness-happy-food-store/,All is wellness at Happy Food Store,"Why can’t all products be ‘fair’ to everyone – animals, humans and nature alike? Happy Food Store is set to make this happen, at least within its four walls. Sometimes activism can come with a hint of preachiness. So did   (grassroots in English), a volunteer-led eco-store in Helsinki, during its very early days in the beginning of the ‘80s. “Initially, the thinking might’ve been slightly black and white – things were either good or bad,” says CEO  . “But fanaticism and blame don’t help in promoting wellness and naturalness.” Food for thought. The company promotes wellness and naturalness. When Ranta-aho joined the Ruohonjuuri team in 2000, the company decided it was time to go mainstream. It moved from its earlier, more remote location to the very centre of Helsinki to attract everyone, not just its loyal and committed customers. The method worked: now, the chain operates a total of 11 stores and a webshop in Finland. Despite the broadening target audience, Ruohonjuuri’s selection of eco-friendly and natural food, drinks, detergents and cosmetics has not been designed to compete with regular grocery stores. Instead, the company focuses on the added value it can bring with its carefully chosen product range, friendly and knowledgeable customer service, and welfare-related services, such as events and courses. Ranta-aho notes that Ruohonjuuri wants customers to be able to rely on its judgement. They don’t need to make ‘the good choice’, because in Ruohonjuuri, they know that the choice has already been made. “Customers can come in knowing that any purchase they make is good for everyone: the environment, animals and, of course, their own wellbeing.” The store’s international name refers to how it wants everyone to feel: happy. Then, word started coming in from Ruohonjuuri’s store in Turku, the west coast of Finland. Swedish customers were telling the shopkeepers that Stockholm could really do with a similar shop. “It sounded strange, as normally Finns tend to think that Swedes are ahead of us in everything,” Ranta-aho notes. A few visits and a couple of market surveys later, the decision was made. The first   opened its doors in central Stockholm in January to plenty of buzz from local and social media. The concept was adjusted to appeal to Swedish customers. For example, Ranta-aho points out that in Sweden an eco-store must have a coffee shop or a deli on the side. Happy Food Store hosts a Finnish-owned GreenStreet shop serving natural treats to health-conscious Stockholmers. As the opening event proved wildly popular, Ranta-aho sees a lot of room for expansion in Sweden alone. Stockholm could be home to at least two stores, and other big cities boast an abundant potential customer base – as do other Nordic countries. Happy Food Store’s opening event gathered plenty of interest in the Swedish capital. Happy Food Store’s success abroad spells good times for other Finnish companies as well. Not only has the concept been created by Finnish designers, many products in the shop’s selection hail from Finland. Ranta-aho deems Finland to be miles ahead in natural cosmetics in comparison to its western neighbour. “We’re definitely working hard to create opportunities for Finnish innovations,” he says. “We also want to help companies become more sustainable by, for example, offering a platform for launching ecological products and introducing eco-friendly packaging alternatives.” Ruohonjuuri also aims to be at the forefront of new trends. For example, it was involved in the lobbying of a law allowing the sale of insect-based products for food consumption, and the company also provides grants to innovative new companies. “We follow what’s hot around the world and then seek Finnish producers who could help us deliver it to our customers. That’s why our clients know that if something’s trending, we’ll be one of the first to sell it.” Ruohonjuuri is also keen to develop its webshop to serve more and more international customers – as well as more and more Finnish companies. “We really want to encourage and inspire Finnish innovations to head out to the world. We Finns have a good reputation – but a really small domestic market.” GreenStreet, also owned by a Finn, makes Happy Food Store a place for hanging out."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/soften-cushions-sound-with-nordic-style/,Soften cushions sound with Nordic style,"Tackling echo and noise issues can be done with style (and Moomins). This is the mantra of Finnish acoustics specialist Soften.   Noise pollution. For once there is a technical term that sounds exactly like what it means: the distracting clamour of noises and echoes we often encounter in large public spaces, open offices and even at homes. Soften creates easy-to-customise, modular acoustic elements for public and commercial spaces. Turku-based   believes the solution to these noise problems doesn’t have to be hidden away inside wall and ceiling structures. The company creates acoustics panels and dividers that can be tailored to meet any interior design need. “Of course, our core focus is acoustics, but besides that the most important factor for us is how a product looks,” stresses  , CEO and founder of Soften. “We aim to make stylish and easily transformable products which you are not ashamed to put on display in any space.” While acoustic products have existed for decades, not many companies can boast over 80 colour options and various patterns (including waves, lines and even Moomin characters). In addition, Soften’s modular panels don’t require any special installation  skills or tools but can be fitted with Velcro tapes. This means the shapes, sizes and colour combinations they create can be quickly adjusted when the inspiration strikes. Now Soften aims to take its product versatility to the next level. A year ago, the five-person company introduced a new cutting method which makes it possible to create almost any shape – such as a company logo, text or an artistic vision – out of its acoustics panels. “We noticed there is a lot of demand from designers and architects to create exactly the installation they want,” explains Helle. “The designer makes the drawing, sends it to us and we feed it into our cutting machinery. We can quickly and cost-efficiently make the products the customers wants.” “In the United Arab Emirates you need to spend a few years getting to know everyone before deals start coming through. But when you gain their trust everything gets much easier,” explains Helle, when discussing the complexities of international expansion. This has been already tested with projects such as creating brand-compliant floating acoustic elements for the trendy Flow music festival in Helsinki. This isn’t the only new product line for Soften. In late 2016 the company launched its first acoustic light named Bellø. The half-sphere-shaped ceiling light absorbs sound to create a feeling of privacy. Like all Soften products, it is manufactured in Finland and made of chemical-free, non-allergenic and recyclable polyester-felt. But getting the light to the market was a real test of the 11-year old company’s manufacturing expertise. “Although the product looks simple, its manufacturing is challenging. It took us a long time to hone our mould and production methods to make it work,” Helle says. “But the light has been very well received, and we would like to invest more into the lighting side.” Lights aside, Soften is confident tailor-made acoustic products will become its calling card internationally. The company already has customers in select European markets, as well as in Russia and the United Arab Emirates, but this is the year Soften will invest heavily in expansion. “Internationalisation is where we are going to get our growth from in the near future,” Helle says. “Our focus areas at the moment are Japan and the UAE.” Soften has already found local agents in both markets and has stands booked at trade fairs in Tokyo and Milan. But Helle has no misconceptions success will happen overnight. “You need to have many nets cast out internationally because it always takes time to build demand,” he says. “In five years’ time, we want to have the same turnover from all the new markets we enter as from Finland.” The latest addition to Soften’s collection of acoustics products is the Bellø ceiling light. It absorbs sound to create a feeling of privacy."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/contractzen-cuts-contract-chaos-with-the-cloud/,ContractZen cuts contract chaos with the cloud,"A new Finnish cloud service combines contract management, document sharing and e-signatures to ensure critical documents are never lost again.  Contract management should be the easy part of business today. Which is why the number  , CEO at  , lays on the table is so striking: up to 20 per cent of all contracts globally are permanently misplaced. “Many companies say they have various tools for managing documents, but still their contracts are scattered around,” Mikola explains. “Some are in centralised archives, but most are on people’s computers and email. There are many reasons for this, but often the biggest ones are the complexity and price of contract management systems.” This is where ContractZen steps in. The startup has developed an easy-to-use cloud service (also called ‘ContractZen’) where companies can securely manage their contracts, board meetings and key documents. Targeted at companies of all sizes, its pricing is based on monthly subscriptions with no setup fees. This might not sound revolutionary, but it is a combination Mikola says makes ContractZen unique. While other tools for document and meeting management exist, the Helsinki-based startup claims to be the only to offer a cloud solution that merges them into a single service. It also throws in electronic signing and virtual data rooms for document sharing. “There is a need for this package we have built everywhere. Our service works both for a small startup and a big global corporation,” Mikola enthuses. “We already have customers in 15 countries, in Asia, Europe and North and South America.” “For a SaaS service to succeed, it needs to be easy to find, try, understand, use and buy. If one of these fails, that’s the end,” says Markus Mikola. ContractZen stems from Mikola and co-founder  ’s own experiences. As IT consultants, they have seen the problems (and extra costs) caused by missed contract deadlines or not finding the right documents. “We started to think why this hasn’t been fixed yet even though big corporations have spent billions to address it?” Mikola recalls. “Everyone should know what has been agreed, be reminded of important dates and be able to find the needed documents wherever and whenever.” But creating a service like ContractZen required the right timing. Mikola says building it would have been too expensive even five years ago, but by 2014 cloud technologies had matured enough to change the situation. The first version of ContractZen was launched in July 2015 and focused solely on contracts. It was ContractZen’s customers who then started to ask for features to manage all the key documents in a company. Today, backed by over a million euros in funding, the startup’s aim is to cover all the materials that determine the value of a company and would interest a potential investor, buyer or even the taxman. This all-in-one approach has also caught the interest of several big brands. A significant partner for ContractZen is accountancy and consultancy giant PwC, which offers the cloud service to its customers across Finland. The startup is also part of Microsoft’s global programmes and has integration agreements with services such as   and Adobe Sign. The next step for ContractZen is to shift gears in sales. So far, the startup has built up its customer base through online marketing and resellers, but eventually Mikola envisions the company having a physical presence in key markets, notably the UK and the US. These helping hands will be needed for ContractZen to reach its goal of hundreds of thousands of users within the next three years. “Of course, nothing stops us from having even more users, but that is a challenging goal,” Mikola says. “We want to be a cloud SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] service for all companies and also help small entrepreneurs succeed.” ContractZen believes the next major evolution in contract and document management are electronic signatures and metadata-based searches. Both are already part of its cloud software."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-lighting/,Five for Friday: Lighting,"This notable quintet is helping the world see the light with Finnish innovations. Much is made of Finland’s see-sawing levels of daylight during the year. Similarly, the world is also waking up to the innovative lighting solutions illuminating the future from up north. This lighting design company targets its services to cities, buildings, construction companies and the like that want to illuminate their architecture or infrastructure. Advertising and marketing are also fields in which Valoa sees enormous future potential for light design companies. “We no longer talk about lamps, but signals, communications and the ways in which we experience our environments,” CEO    . “It’s a whole psychological entirety.” Here, wireless software and hardware components are integrated by luminaire manufacturers into their products and used by professionals to create and control lighting environments. The unique smart lighting control system comes with mobile apps to allow for easy configuration and management of these lights. “If you have tunable, smart lights you can use timers or sensors to programme them based on the amount of light outside,” CEO . “Tunable lights are an upcoming trend particularly in companies which are interested in their ambiance or the wellbeing and productivity of employees.” The ‘Q-Flow’ operating theatre light from this veteran hospital equipment supplier is highly colour accurate, enabling surgeons to detect exact tones as they operate. It also automatically eliminates shadows as the surgeon moves. What further sets the Q-Flow apart from the competition is its unusual doughnut-like shape. The spaces between its concentric rings allow air to flow freely and be extracted by the theatre’s air filtration system, thus keeping bacteria out of the operating area. “This is where Q-Flow is more advanced than any other light in the world,” CEO    . “The standard, large UFO-like operating theatre lights create a vacuum on the top and bacteria is spread around the room uncontrollably.” Reducing energy consumption by approximately 70 per cent, this automated street lighting is activated by motion detection. The wireless interlinked system works by increasing the brightness of all nearby lighting units once movement is detected. “We are saving energy by dimming down the luminescence in areas where there is no use for light,” company CEO  . “We are also reducing light pollution without sacrificing the comfortability and security gained by lighting.” The rough conditions of a construction site require hardy luminescence. Unlike regular, fluorescent, temporary construction site lights, MBerg is an LED light, which makes it very robust, maintenance-free and gives it a longer lifetime. “All our products have something special about them that makes them stand out,”  . “For instance, our switchboards are the ‘Rolls-Royces’ of that category. Generally, our approach is to offer high-end products rather than to compete with pricing.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nordic-fit-mama-puts-mothers-back-shape/,Nordic Fit Mama puts mothers back in shape,"Post-pregnancy issues in women’s bodies aren’t publicly discussed far and wide. Nordic Fit Mama wants to help mothers find accurate information before any harm is done. Nordic Fit Mama isn’t just about fitness – it sees wellbeing as a mixture of things. had no idea she had been suffering from abdominal separation. For one-and-a-half years she, a mother of three and qualified personal trainer, had made every possible mistake when exercising, deteriorating her condition. “Despite my profession, I had never even heard of such a thing,” she says now, three years later. “Only after hours spent on Google did I start to realise what was messing up my body.” The most obvious symptom was the lack of control she felt over her core muscles. Back pain and urinary incontinence are other indicators – but not a lot of women suspect something is wrong, as they just assume that’s how they’re supposed to feel after giving birth. For Laaksonen, reversing the mistakes was a long and rocky road. She realised how much easier things could’ve been, had she only known to avoid the situation in the first place. “I didn’t want anyone else to have to go down the same path. It’s so much easier and more pleasant not to – you get to enjoy life so much more.” That’s the basis of  , an online service for mothers created by Laaksonen and fellow maternal health professionals, and run alongside her wellness studio Lupaus. Laaksonen is an economist by education with a lengthy career in information technology. As she had stayed at home with her children for some years, she decided it’d be time to find a job with less sitting down and more activity. The end result was Lupaus, which was founded in 2014. Nordic Fit Mama followed suit pretty quickly. Although Laaksonen never intended to target mothers in particular, her own experiences guided the direction of the company. “It just became obvious how much people search for information about post-pregnancy issues, especially about abdominal separation,” she tells. “A lot of the info is scattered around here and there, and many rely heavily on online forums, but they can be unreliable.” The videos are filmed in the Finnish outdoors for a bit of a boost of freshness.” Nordic Fit Mama offers different kinds of training courses for mothers recovering from childbirth. They are not merely exercise classes; instead, the courses take a holistic approach to wellbeing, not forgetting the mental side of things. The contributors are professionals in relevant fields, such as midwifery, nutrition and sexual health. On top of that, the service is also an online community. “There are so many topics new mothers talk about with their peers,” Laaksonen notes. “Receiving fact-based guidance from trustworthy sources will make the phase much smoother. Having a baby is about as life-changing as things get.” At the moment, Nordic Fit Mama has a selection of five courses in Finnish and one in English. The English version was first piloted in Canada, which Laaksonen sees as a great place to start conquering North America in general. The courses are adapted and supplemented according to customer feedback, and plenty of new content is in the pipeline. There are also other digital services in the making, but so far Laaksonen has wanted to keep quiet about them. “We get a lot of ideas from mothers, so we’ve got a lot of things to work with,” she says. Further internationalisation is being planned, too. The pilots will help Nordic Fit Mama to define its go-to-market strategies. For a digital service, geography doesn’t pose a challenge. Finland is present in Nordic Fit Mama’s image – quite literally. As Laaksonen changed careers to be able to be on the move more, the course videos aren’t filmed in a gloomy studio. “We film everything out in the nature. After all, nature is one of the things that makes us Nordic.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/items-seized-by-airport-security-cotio-can-help/,Items seized by airport security? Cotio can help,"A miserable experience at airport security led to the creation of Cotio, a Finnish startup reuniting passengers with items seized by airport security. Have you ever wondered how many restricted and prohibited items are confiscated every year by airport security? The number stands at roughly 400 000 at Helsinki Airport, according to  . While most of the items are water bottles, cosmetics and personal hygiene products that exceed the restrictions on carry-on liquids, occasionally air passengers are faced with the decision of whether to risk missing their flight or lose something of monetary or emotional value. If you have ever found yourself in such a position, you will be able to empathise with  , the founder and chief executive of  , a startup offering airports a way to return confiscated items to passengers. Cotio CEO Kimmo Collander showed his dedication to the company, by competing in this year’s Polar Bear Pitching. Collander reveals that the business idea was conceived following a “miserable” experience at airport security. “I had forgotten my pocketknife in my hand baggage, and at the time there was no way to reclaim it,” he tells. Cotio launched its service at Helsinki Airport in September 2016. The idea is simple: Whenever airport security staff remove an item from a passenger, they place a sticker with an identification code on the item and present the passenger with a receipt for the surrendered item. A similar receipt will be used to replace any items removed from checked baggage. The passenger can then use the identification code to reclaim the item through the online service of Cotio, which delivers it directly to the passenger or to a smart post terminal at the airport. “Our role depends on the wishes of the airport operator. We can either pick up the items directly from airport security or from a depot used by the airport operator,” says Collander. “We make it as easy and fast as possible for the airport staff. The item is marked, the customer gets the receipt and can order delivery of the item at their own convenience.” Collander reveals that the startup is currently working on introducing radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to its service to facilitate the monitoring and simplify the pricing of reclaimed items. A gateway to disappointment no more. He points out that the service is an excellent means for airport operators to improve the customer experience, particularly as security screening is one of the most stressful parts of passengers’ journey through the airport. “If it leaves a bad taste in their mouth, it’ll stick and the airport may suffer later if they have to make a choice between several alternative routes,” highlights Collander. Another benefit for airport operators is that the service allows them to resolve conflicts that could otherwise clog up security screening queues. The benefits for air passengers are more obvious: “Passengers don’t enjoy having to hand over their items – and like getting them back. Some items may have emotional value that can’t be measured in money. They’re especially important,” explains Collander. Cotio has estimated that roughly a million items worth more than 10 euros are confiscated annually at airport security. “That’s purely our own estimate,” stresses Collander. “One or two in every 10 000 passengers are potential customers for us.” He reveals that the three-person startup is currently looking to expand its ownership base and partner up with a few airport operators in Europe. Cotio has already received 150 000 euros in funding from Business Finland. “We’ll move forward with the partnership contracts in the months to come and should start expanding quite rapidly after that,” he tells."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/anaxeos-speaks-dogs-health/,Anaxeos speaks for our dogs’ health,"Despite not being a dog whisperer, Finnish-made Anaxeos still helps dog lovers find out how their furry friends are doing. Our assessments of the wellbeing of our pets are educated guesses at best.   used to have to guess a lot when caring for his four Parson Russell Terriers, all of different ages and activity levels. Koutu couldn’t help but wonder if the youngest one got too tired on long walks, whereas the most energetic one might want to keep on going. We all wish we could ask our dogs how they’re doing. Anaxeos lets data speak. “As there’s no real data available, it’s just a subjective evaluation you make watching your dogs and observing their behaviour,” Koutu says. “All kinds of activity gadgets measuring us humans are abundant and everywhere, but the only thing for dogs was a GPS tracker for hunters.” Koutu’s solution is  , developed by his company Sense of Intelligence. Anaxeos is a lightweight vest with sensors that track things such as heart rate and temperature, connected to a mobile app that then reveals the data and interprets them so that the dog’s carer can take action. It also enables monitoring the dog’s condition even when the owner is on holiday thousands of kilometres away. “Anaxeos doesn’t make pie charts and histograms,” Koutu explains. “Instead, it makes sense of the numbers and gives alerts and suggestions regarding things like what to do if your dog’s temperature is too high.” Koutu emphasises that the product isn’t a speech generator; the data speak, but the dog still doesn’t. However, the idea is to improve understanding by bringing the lives of the pet and its owner closer to each other. Koutu calls this improving the shared life of two separate beings. Anaxeos isn’t yet on the shop shelves, but pre-sales will begin as soon as possible. The product has gathered plenty of intrigue from all over the world, particularly when Koutu was presenting it at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in February. For example,   chose it as one of its top picks from the event. “It was pretty crazy,” Koutu recalls, “to be there alongside giants like Amazon and Samsung, and then this one-man company gets people so excited.” Sense of Intelligence aims to deliver the pre-orders by Christmas. Koutu believes that although Finns will be the first ones to get their hands on the product, dog owners from everywhere will be interested. Particularly in Europe and North America, as well as in Asia, pet owners are investing more and more money in their pets’ health and accessories. For Toni Koutu, the wellbeing of his dogs is a serious business. “Dogs are omnipresent as pets, particularly in Western societies,” he notes. “In this day and age, people are willing to invest in their wellbeing.” Koutu runs Sense of Intelligence mostly alone, with the help of investors as well as experts in animal health and sensor technology. He laughingly says that the company was founded by him and his dogs together. His own background is in information technology, first almost 14 years with Nokia and then as an independent consultant. Dogs have been by his side throughout the whole time. Love for dogs is also the inspiration for the product name. According to a Greek legend, Anaxeos was the owner of a dog called Parthenope on the island of Lesbos. When the dog passed away, Anaxeos added a heartwarming text on the gravestone, paying tribute to their partnership. “It goes to show that the journeys of our lives are closely knit together, and have been so for a very long time,” Koutu says. “Our pets mean the world to us, and so should their happiness, too.”"

The phone call began innocuously enough. On the other end of the line was the Italian Embassy. After pleasantries were exchanged, it soon became apparent that things were less than  . The reason they had contacted Kotipizza? Well, pizza of course. “I’m a strong believer in doing the right thing with the raw materials, the farmers and the franchisers,” says CEO Tommi Tervanen. Back in 2005, then Italian Prime Minister   had caused a minor diplomatic incident by mentioning that he had to “endure the Finnish diet” during a state visit. Kotipizza, it seemed, had had the last laugh. A few years later, the Finnish chain won the America’s Plate International pizza contest in New York City. The name of its prize pie? Pizza Berlusconi, of course. Adding insult to injury, the distinctly Finnish combination of smoked reindeer atop a rye crust promptly became a staple of Kotipizza’s menu. “The Italian embassy called us to take it down: ‘You cannot advertise using our prime minister’s name,’” recalls CEO  , with a hearty chuckle. “We replied that he better come here himself and tell us, then we will.” Needless to say, Berlusconi never did make it back to Finland. However, if he had he would have borne witness to a pizza chain that would become nothing short of a local phenomenon. Currently 266 restaurants strong, the Kotipizza chain’s sales have skyrocketed and it is now one of the largest restaurant chains in Finland. At the same time, the Kotipizza Group’s stock price has nearly tripled. Amidst all this upward trajectory, the sense of mischief and adventure remains intact at the Kotipizza Group. Rather than sit back and enjoy the vantage point from atop a mountain of cash, the team have another plan: cracking the international market with a new franchise. How are they going to do this? The answer is  . Housed in a stark space with a distinct visual identity, each No Pizza restaurant offers a signature menu. Customers also have the opportunity to choose their own customised combinations of toppings. No Pizza is opening a pilot restaurant in Helsinki in the summer, with plans to go international. “The more people eat these pizzas, the more they will recognise the locally sourced, organic ingredients,” Tervanen explains. “This brand is very much directed to millennials.” Any good business idea must be built on a solid foundation. “If you start to build a pizza you start from the bottom, meaning the dough,” Tervanen says. “We wanted a very different angle, so we teamed up with   to create a sourdough crust.” Tapping into the global enthusiasm for artisan breads, No Pizza says no to dull, tasteless and undercooked bases. And that’s not it for the negativity. “We say no to a lot of bad things: no to additives, no to bad working conditions, no to bad animal welfare, no to plastic and no to arseholes.” Now the Nordics await, with the company looking to commence operations in Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen. Once the first step is taken abroad, No Pizza will have done what few other Finnish eateries have successfully attempted: take their idea abroad. It’s all about the base. “The Arctic way of thinking has a certain resonance,” Tervanen says. “When you come from Finland the brand should be exciting. When you hear ‘No Pizza’, you immediately become interested.” The CEO also hopes that the venture’s success will mean that other Finns will make a push towards international recognition. “Finland has great potential on the chef side, concept side and with raw materials. This should be our new Nokia: new agriculture, new design, new food development.” Tervanen is now on a roll, with quotable quotes flowing thick and fast. “Great retailing is great detailing” is one. “We have three values: love what you do, have the will to experiment and the will to succeed” follows, hot on its heels. This all stems from a passion to do something outside the box; to provide a range of flavours and experiences that can be enjoyed everywhere. When Tervanen mentions that the final tweaks to the concept are being made, one’s mind drifts back south to Italy. So, will a certain former politician be present in the decision-making process? “Ah, no, Berlusconi will not be involved.” [laughs]"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/baba-is-you-surprises-gamers-with-word-power/,Baba Is You surprises gamers with word power,"Finland is recognised as a global force when it comes to the games industry. But some of its most intriguing projects originate outside traditional games studios. Finnish indie developer Arvi Teikari is a testament to that.  Sometimes the simplest things can bring the biggest surprises. This is the case with  , a PC game developed by 25-year-old Finn  . On the surface, it looks like a classic puzzle game where blocks are shuffled around to solve a problem. But   takes the challenge up a notch by allowing players to bend the rules. “What makes the game special is that all its rules are visible as movable ‘blocks’,” explains Teikari. “This makes it possible for a player to change the rules in the midst of playing the game, for example, make solid walls passable or turn water into a goal line.” The result is clever wordplays and surprising interactions, as well as a win at the Nordic Game Jam (NGJ) last year. Although   was only meant to be a 48-hour development experiment at the NGJ, winning the main prize changed Teikari’s plans. As a consequence of the interest this generated, he is now working on a more complex commercial version of the game set for release in summer 2018. Arvi Teikari wants to challenge and surprise players with his experimental games. Teikari is nothing short of prolific. He has over 35 titles (as far as he remembers) in his portfolio and two in development. This is in addition to studying psychology at the   and working at small Finnish studio  , which he co-founded in 2017. “My real game-making hobby started when I was in the fourth or fifth grade when a classmate introduced me to the Game Maker tool,” Teikari recalls. “So, I would say I have developed games for about 16 years now.” In that time Teikari, or   as his one-man company is called, has become known in the games circles as a specialist in small experimental games. He enjoys working in short time-frames at game jams – where you typically create a game in 48 hours – and makes most of his games available to everyone for free. An exception here is Teikari’s first commercial game, a space adventure called   which he published in 2015. Now   has the potential to take Teikari’s commercial endeavours further. At the end of March, he will present it at the global Game Developers Conference (GDC) and its side-event, the Independent Games Festival (IGF), in San Francisco. This could bring Teikari further accolades as   is nominated for four IGF awards, including the 30 000-US dollar Seumas McNally Grand Prize. Despite the international interest in  , Teikari remains level-headed. For him game development is not about commercial success, but about creating games that evoke a strong response whether that is surprise, awe, empathy or even sadness.   achieves this with the deceptive simplicity of the game. “In my opinion, a perfect puzzle is one where a player is given very few tools and the puzzle appears impossible to solve with these tools. These kinds of puzzles are very satisfying because they are based on working out a certain ‘trick’ rather than managing a complex system,” Teikari summarises. “I aim to take   in a direction which maximises this effect.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/taimer-brings-business-management-tools-one-cloud/,Taimer brings business management tools under one cloud,"Invoicing, time tracking, project management. This is only the start of a long list of the business management systems used by companies. Now a Finnish cloud service promises to bring them all under one roof. Juggling multiple software programs and spreadsheets for different business needs is a challenge   knows well. Five years ago, he was looking to solve this exact problem for his marketing company, and that is how he found  , CEO and founder of  . Fredi Palmgren “Eero was in the process of building a software called Taimer to address this problem. We sat down to talk about our visions and just clicked,” recalls Palmgren, today COO and partner at Taimer. “We both wanted to stop the fragmentation that happens when you set up a company and start to research tools for managing your customers, invoices, time management, tasks and more.” Fast forward to 2018 and Taimer is doing precisely this. The startup has 16 employees and cloud-based software it claims will cover everything a company needs to manage its day-to-day processes, from scheduling to finances. The goal is to replace disconnected systems, single-function apps and spreadsheets with one integrated platform. Taimer’s approach is working. According to Palmgren, the software is already used by several thousand companies of all sizes. “Companies want ease-of-use, agility and cost-efficiency,” he explains. “You can improve productivity and save time when you have a tool people actually like to use and where all different modules work together.” A real breakthrough for Taimer came in late 2017 at the Slush startup event in Helsinki. The startup launched two product packages for sole traders and small companies, and at the same time announced a partnership with Nordea, the biggest financial group in the Nordics. “We are, together with Nordea, creating a completely new way for companies to manage their banking and financials,” Palmgren says. “We are integrating Taimer with multiple services the bank offers including e-invoicing, factoring, automated payment tracking and processing purchasing invoices.” Palmgren sees this as a win-win situation. For Nordea, the collaboration offers a new way to facilitate the everyday operations of especially its smaller business customers and strengthen the bank’s relationship with them. For Taimer, it opens the door to over 500 000 potential customers in the Nordics and Baltics. Taimer is targeting global markets with new small company and team versions of its cloud-based business management software. It is partnerships like this that play a key role in Taimer’s expansion strategy. Its software already integrates with numerous accounting software platforms, and now the startup is casting its net wider. “Many financial institutions, software providers and telecoms companies with local and global marketplaces are looking for innovative software-as-a-service companies like us to offer as a value-added service,” Palmgren explains. “It is a growing trend in many industries.” Taimer’s partner network will also feature prominently as the startup turns its attention to international sales. The company already has customers as far as South Africa and the US, and a new sales team to build upon them. “Our primary focus, in the near future, is set on the Nordics, Europe, the UK and the US. English-language markets are a good starting point for us,” Palmgren says. Part of Taimer’s plan is to build local sales organisations in key markets and add new language versions of its software. But this requires a lot of resources. To date Taimer has resisted startup convention by being entirely self-funded, but now in the growth stage the company is discussing outside investment. “It is quite a task to take this kind of operation global,” Palmgren says. “All industries are getting digitised and we target this market with a very strong product. It takes a lot of work and a great team, but a year from now our software should be available in 100 countries.” 2017 ended in a high for Taimer. The startup signed a major partnership deal with Nordic banking giant Nordea in December."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/videoly-makes-sales-move/,Videoly makes sales move,"What do predators on the savannah and videos in online sales have in common? Finnish Videoly figured it out – and now measurably boosts webshops with its simple tool. It has all been a coincidence for   co-founder  . “I had been through a lot of job interviews looking for something new, but nothing really felt right,” she explains in the comfort of Videoly’s office in central Helsinki. “Then an old friend got in touch and asked me if I had yet found anything. He told me about this Sergey he had met who’s looking for someone ‘exactly like me’.” One of Videoly’s benefits is its ease of use. All it takes to implement it is a couple of clicks. The friend turned out to be spot on. Huovila, who had been working for a technology company in London, found that the most attractive opportunity came from an unknown Russian engineer with an exceptional fondness for Finland – and the job didn’t pay. “I know it’s pretty crazy,” she admits laughingly. “But I believe in magic and guidance.” , the aforementioned Russian, had founded Videoly in 2014. Huovila jumped on board a little later and was astonished. “He had already sold the Videoly software to some big companies that were happy users, and he’s a guy with almost no sales skills,” Huovila says with a grin. “I realised the product must be pretty top notch!” Videoly’s idea is to add videos to online shops without having to actually film them. This happens by harnessing and using pre-existing content, be it from the product’s manufacturers, consumers or bloggers and vloggers. The Videoly tool finds the videos, and just by adding a couple of lines of code to the webstore, they will automatically appear on the site. In between, a pair of human eyes will have gone through the content to make sure it’s suitable and relevant. For example, videos including crushing reviews or advertising competing shops will be excluded. And it works. Huovila says that one of their clients has said that Videoly pays itself back tenfold. “We humans are visual beings,” she explains. “We’ve been programmed to pay attention to moving things ever since our ancestors had to be wary of predators in the bushes.” Co-founders Nora Huovila and Sergey Andryukhin. Video is also the most efficient way to deliver the feel of a product without really touching it. Sounds and movement help arouse emotions, and that, Huovila notes, is what makes people buy. There’s the convenience, too. Watching a two-minute video is oh so much less labour-intensive than going through a whole manual. “Because a video stimulates various senses, it’s very resource-efficient for the brain.” Hence Videoly works particularly well with products such as tools and consumer electronics. Seeing a photo of the product might not add much value, but a video is a great way to show off its features and demonstrate its capabilities. Videoly already boasts an impressive list of customers in Finland. Currently, the company is establishing a partnership network in the rest of the Nordic countries and the UK. “This year our goal is to triple our turnover, and I believe that the majority of it will come from international markets,” Huovila predicts. The partners are, for example, online store developers, who can use Videoly in their own service offering. Of course, video streaming sites like YouTube are an option, too. As the existing content is in English, the focus is on English-speaking countries as well as countries where English is widely used and understood. In the future, the scope might broaden to also include other languages. Whatever happens next, Huovila is confident that it’s going to be good. “We’re not sure where the future will take us, but we already know it’ll be bright. We want to be the go-to video solution for everyone, globally.” A well-made video can also replace the need for written manuals, and it helps understand the features of the product."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-spain-come-together-moimoi/,Finland and Spain come together with MoiMoi,"MoiMoi mixes Finnish functionalism and Spanish leather crafting skills to create bags that only get better with time. MoiMoi’s do-it-yourself approach has seen the business grow. Helsinki is in the midst of a snowstorm when I meet  , founder of  , at her studio. Despite her Spanish roots, after 12 years in Finland the cold doesn’t bother Miranda. In fact, it is the Finns’ fondness for clean lines and practicality that inspires her sustainable handcrafted bags. “The main pillar of my design philosophy is to make bags to be used. Bags to fit the city life,” Miranda explains. “We try to keep their style as simple and minimalistic as possible because we want to make timeless design and products that can last a lifetime.” This means working with materials that can stand, or even get better with, the passing of time. In MoiMoi’s case the answer has been using thick vegetable-tanned leather in all of its products, which include handbags, satchels, totes and wallets. Instead of trendy colours or seasonal collections, the bags come in natural shades and new items are added only once or twice a year. In addition, Miranda and co-founder   want to keep a close eye on how the bags are manufactured. To ensure they know every step in the production chain, MoiMoi only works with small producers in Spain and Finland. MoiMoi’s got your back. The roots of MoiMoi can be traced back to 2006. Specifically, to an exchange year took Miranda took in Kuopio, Eastern Finland. This snowy city surrounded by forests was quite a change from her hometown on the warm Atlantic side of Spain. “I studied textile and clothing design in Kuopio. It was really different from my school since I came from an art university in Spain,” she recalls. “I learnt a lot about handicrafts. I realised that if I learn to do things myself I can start a business without needing large resources. So, I learnt to sew and work with leather.” It still took several years for MoiMoi to take shape. Miranda returned to Spain to finish her master’s degree and came back to Finland, this time to Helsinki, to do an internship at Finnish fashion brand Ivana Helsinki. Then she met Järveläinen. “He encouraged me to start my own company in Finland. I was 25 so it was a bit crazy, but I did it,” Miranda says with a laugh. “He is a graphic designer and helped with all the technical details and graphics. We started MoiMoi in 2010.” MoiMoi means “bye bye” in English and it is the first Finnish phrase Miranda learned. Yet eight years later the company is saying hello to wider international markets having established a loyal customer base in Finland and having fans as far afield as Australia and the US. “We make bags for the city life. Our inspiration comes from the things you need when you live in a city, from our personal experiences,” explains Raquel Alonso Miranda. Pictured also is MoiMoi co-founder Kalle Järveläinen. It is this international appeal MoiMoi wants to explore next. The brand’s bags are already available globally online and sold through a few selected retailers in Finland, Japan and Spain, but for Miranda this just scratches the surface. “We have reached the top in Finland, we cannot grow much more here so we want to focus on two things,” she explains. “Firstly, the focus of our online shop is to get more into Europe. Secondly, we are testing wider opportunities to go the Asian market.” This is where MoiMoi has enlisted a helping hand. The company is part of Business Finland’s trade programme which helps Finnish design companies enter the Japanese market. MoiMoi already has some sales in the country, but Miranda believes a growing demand for long-lasting, sustainable and functional design is the most important factor “People abroad like the fact we come from Finland and Helsinki, they associate them with good quality and design,” she says. “We want to combine the best sides from both countries. The simple, practical style from Finland and the Spanish leather handicraft expertise.” “All our bags are made by hand and unique. They are never going to be exact plastic copies, all have little differences because leather is a natural material,” Miranda says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slush-delivers-everything-but-the-weather-in-tokyo/,Slush delivers everything but the weather in Tokyo,"Some of Finland’s brightest virtual and augmented reality startups took part in the 2018 Slush Tokyo.  Slush Tokyo CEO Antti Sonninen takes the stage. There are no signs of slush on the ground in Tokyo in March. But in every other respect this is what one might expect of what has grown into one of the leading startup conventions in the world: an almost overwhelming buzz of excitement, constant flow of wild ideas and endless supply of big-dreaming entrepreneurs. Slush made its debut in Tokyo in 2015. Organised now for the fourth time, the convention drew some 6–7 000 registered visitors, 600 startups and 200 investors to Tokyo Big Sight between 28 and 29 March. “The situation here [in 2015] was similar to what it was in Finland,” tells  , the CEO of  . “Young people mostly wanted to work for big companies. A startup was not a typical career choice.” Slush, he adds, set out not only to make entrepreneurship a more attractive career choice for talented young people but also to serve as an interface between the local and international startup scene. “We wanted to create a community that brings these two scenes together,” he says. Slush has inched closer to its objective year after year. This year’s participants included an estimated 350–450 local startups eager to create networks and show off their products, as well as a handful of cities eager to showcase the strengths of their business environment. “This is an amazing event,” exclaims  , the chief technology officer at Sagojo, a web-based platform connecting travellers around the world with short-term job opportunities. “I feel like I’m being swallowed up by wonderful technology,” he said, pointing to a massive human-controlled mechanical apparatus next to him. The event offered plenty of edge-of-your seat inspiration. “Events such as this help to both vitalise the local scene and generate interest abroad,” views  , an engineer at Sagojo. The City of Sendai has set itself the objective of becoming the most startup-friendly city in Japan.  , a public connector at Sendai, reveals that the city is seeking to instil an entrepreneurial spirit in young people by developing an environment that encourages them to get involved, be it by setting up their own business or by organising events for other aspiring entrepreneurs. “We’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of businesses and we want to support and accelerate the growth of startups by creating an ecosystem and, ultimately, a community for startups,” he tells. “These ecosystems will hopefully create success stories and role models for others.” As Slush continues – to cadge the theme of this year’s event – to break barriers between various startup scenes and promote a culture that enables entrepreneurs to succeed regardless of age, gender, culture or language, some of its participants are breaking the barrier between reality and make-believe. “Finnish companies are true trailblazers in the virtual and augmented reality space,” says Business Finland’s Marko Salonen (centre). Such aspirations were a common denominator for many of the startups represented at the pavilion hosted jointly by   and the  . “Finnish companies are true trailblazers in the virtual and augmented reality space,” says  , a programme director at Business Finland. “And this is an observation that has been made also outside Finland.” “[They’re ahead of the curve] partly because the competences needed are similar to those needed in the games cluster.  ’s heritage and competences in optics and hardware, for example, are another reason. Nokia’s lessons learnt have trickled down also to our VR and AR companies.” Japan, on the other hand, is an attractive market for several reasons, its size being one of the more obvious ones. , the founder and chief executive of  , estimates that the local population has a willingness to embrace novel contents and technologies in a way that is exceptional compared to almost anywhere else. Slush Tokyo brought its own distinct flavour to the startup scene. “Finns and Finnish businesses are also considered interesting in Japan,” he adds. “The infrastructure here is great,”  , the founder and chief executive of  , says, surprisingly referring not only to the technology. “The karaoke box culture here, for example, suggests there’s a readiness to consume AR and VR experiences.” , the creative director at the Netherlands-based Wondarlands, reminds in one of the more captivating and thought-provoking presentations of the two-day event that people should also be wary of losing themselves in the midst of the “endless digital noise” the humankind continues to create. Technology, she underlined, should embrace – rather than ignore – the nuances, complexities and awkwardness of human life and interaction. “AR can forge fantastic alternative realities,” she acknowledges. “AR will affect the public, private and intimate space of all of us. We need to anticipate the consequences of what we’re making.” Slush Tokyo invited industry leaders and up-and-comers to come together to create a buzz-worthy event.   is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-has-an-innovative-approach-to-optimised-living/,Finland’s innovative approach to optimised living,"As the fourth industrial revolution moves into our homes, access to data and control of energy use become keys to environmentally friendly and comfortable living. Based on this, everything from maintenance to washing laundry and charging vehicles can be optimised.  Smart buildings are ultimately all about energy used at the right time in the right place. With the technology available today it is possible to optimise, for example, lighting, heating, ventilation and the use of white goods according to weather conditions and market prices. However, contractors and homeowners are not always aware of the available solutions or willing to invest in them. This is why the   event has become an important part of the  , held in March. “There needs to be a change in attitudes towards smart building,” says  , project manager at  . “It should become as self-evident as automatic locks on doors are in houses today.” Knuts emphasises the need for cost-efficient solutions that can pay back investments as quickly as possible, in order to encourage construction companies to use the latest technology. At the same time, the efforts to renovate old buildings need to be tripled to reach the Finnish carbon neutral vision set for 2050. LeaseGreen personalises comprehensive solutions for improving the energy efficiency of properties. Pictured is account director Anssi Virtnanen (left) and sales manager Ari Laitinen. One of the Finnish companies answering the demand for sustainable solutions is  , whose customised solutions are specifically designed to minimise costs. By first optimising energy use and then measuring energy production systems according to actual consumption, the gap between invested money and payback is minimised. At the same time, it has positive effects on the environment. For example, the energy renovation of a hotel in Southern Finland recently resulted in a 50 per cent cut in CO2 emissions. “Improving energy efficiency in existing properties is more difficult than in new constructions as there are more constraints and restrictions,” says the company’s sales manager  . “That is why we personalise comprehensive solutions for every case.” This drive to create better solutions can be found in the way we get around.   highlights the possibilities brought forth by the increasing demand for electric cars. As the electrification of transport plays an important role in Finland’s goal to reduce CO2 emissions, the Finnish government wants to see  . This means new demand for charging stations. “Including charging stations in apartment buildings could increase their value,” says  , the CEO of Vaasan Sähköverkko. “The reality is that you usually charge your car at home or at work and public stations are only used about 10 per cent of the time.” Today’s digitalisation efforts also allow fast maintenance, which is crucial in keeping energy use at the right levels. Mapping the construction is, especially with the emerging augmented reality tools, a matter of exploiting every corner of the house. The relevant data can then be distributed to local actors, which is what  ’s latest development is all about. “The focus is turning to prosumers, which fuses the production and consumption,” Matias Grädler, innovation director at Wapice, explains. “We have been able to transfer the analytics from the construction plan to a maintenance model that can be used in practice,” says  , the company’s business area director. Granlund’s software continuously monitors the building and alerts when something is wrong. All the relevant information is then automatically distributed to local service people who can see the exact location and component that needs to be fixed. “As soon as we find local service people that can be connected to the cloud and hired when needed we will take this solution beyond Finnish borders to Dubai,” says Hausen. Connecting households to smart systems means that the use of renewable energy sources can be maximised. The peaks in production and consumption, which are now balanced with fossil fuels, could instead be tackled, for example, by using the house as a battery that stores and regulates the use of the energy. When regulating the demand, this also means new business models based on sharing and trading electricity. “The focus is turning to prosumers, which fuses the production and consumption,”  , innovation director at  , explains. “If two neighbours produce enough energy for themselves the rest can be transferred to the grid to then be used by others.” Wapice is currently part of two national research projects where this prosumption model is explored and used in practice to form new economic systems. “There is a global problem that needs to be addressed and Finnish technology can help identifying the cause and make improvements,” Grädler summarises."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pentisol-taking-food-spray-kitchens-abroad/,Pentisol is taking its food spray to kitchens abroad,"This over 35-year-old company has revamped its product line, opening the door to international markets. “We knew from the start that we needed to seek growth,” says Pentisol CEO Jari Mäkinen (left, pictured with chairman of the board Sanna Mäkinen). You know that saying about an old dog and new tricks? Well, it’s not always true – not at least in  ’s case. Pentisol, a Järvenpää-based company that has manufactured aerosol spray products since 1981, has not only branched out to a new product category, but is also rapidly expanding its sales abroad. The company originally specialised in industrial products such as silicones, lubricants and detergents. But after concluding that it had more or less reached the limits of growth in its industry in Finland, the firm has sought to diversify its product line in order to unlock international markets. This brought on a new focus on foodstuff: building on its expertise as an aerosol spray company, Pentisol has added food sprays such as cooking, seasoning and olive oil sprays to its catalogue, under the name of  . Here it sells a range of cooking and seasoning sprays. The company also sells a variety of tailored sprays as white-label products, meaning that they are rebranded and sold under the buyer’s name. Despite being a significant actor in the Finnish market, Pentisol is a relatively small firm with its staff of 14. “But I see it rather as an advantage, as we are agile and can start new projects quickly,” says Pentisol CEO  . “And our production line is still rock solid, so we can produce a wide variety of products, and in large quantities.” The company’s new focus on food spray products is bearing fruit: Pentisol has signed deals in Germany and is currently negotiating in the Nordics and the Netherlands, with preliminary discussions going on elsewhere in Europe and Asia. Pentisol produces food sprays for its customers also as white label products. Its latest major contract was signed in Israel, where the firm started shipments last autumn. The firm’s cooking spray has been an especially successful product. “It’s an easy product to sell, because pretty much every kitchen and bakery needs oil for frying, grilling and oiling pans,” Mäkinen says. “Our standard cooking spray is therefore a universal product, but we also make versions with different flavours for different markets.” Indeed, Pentisol creates its own recipes, allowing it to tailor its products based on its clients’ needs. This is especially important when entering a new market where the food culture is different. “Tastes and preferences vary without exception between countries. For example, in some places onion and garlic flavours may be popular, while somewhere else people prefer milder flavours,” Mäkinen says. Moreover, in Asia gas cookers are commonly used and, as they heat up the pan very hot, it poses different requirements on the heat capacity of the used oil. Pentisol has been a family business throughout its long history, now in the second generation: Mäkinen and his wife have been managing the company since 2011. “We knew from the start that we needed to seek growth,” Mäkinen says. “I think it’s crucial, because if there is no progress it will eventually lead to decline.” He encourages Finnish companies in general to be more daring and seek growth from foreign markets: “There’s a lot of promising activity here that would have a good chance, but too often I see reluctance or even fear to try to go abroad. But younger generations generally seem to have a more international outlook.” For anyone who might consider following Pentisol’s example, what should their first steps be? “Market research is crucial, you need to figure out the competition,” Mäkinen says. “You also need careful preparation, and patience not to rush but to do things properly one at the time.” The company also produces a range of cooking and seasoning sprays under the name of Chef’s Season Original."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-slush-tokyo/,Five for Friday: Slush Tokyo,"Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence were the two most dominant themes of Slush Tokyo 2018. With head-scratching buzzwords such as blockchain emanating almost ceaselessly from the four stages set up inside Big Sight’s East Hall 7, the event left most participants with much to contemplate and others, possibly, in a state of bewilderment. The consensus among many veteran participants was that the event was more focused than in previous years, with several of the speakers, startups and panel discussions focusing on the vast future potential of cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence. Here are our main takeaways from the event. Slush, which has emerged as one of the leading startup conferences in the world, continues to grow in Japan. The excitement among the approximately 350–400 local startups in participation was tangible even before the ear-splitting opening ceremony was over, given the rare opportunity to rub shoulders and exchange business cards with some of the most renowned startup entrepreneurs and influencers in the world. The local crew and volunteers, who buzzed around the conference hall tirelessly, did a marvellous job to ensure everything ran smoothly and to re-create the event’s hallmark atmosphere in Tokyo. “Slush is being run almost entirely by locals this year,” commented the visibly satisfied CEO of  ,  . “The local crew and volunteers have been so productive that I’ve actually had a chance to relax a bit,” attested another crew member who had made the trip from Finland to lend a hand in organising the conference. Another sign that the  is catching on was the stronger-than-ever presence of local authorities at Slush Tokyo. The Japanese cities of Fukuoka, Sendai and Yokohama had all set up booths at the event to show off the strengths and special characteristics of their business environment – an indication that a vibrant startup scene is increasingly recognised as a key contributor to regional socio-economic development. , a public connector at the City of Sendai, the most populous city in Northeast Japan, pointed out that the cities are not competing against each other due to their distinct industrial and academic make-ups. “We want to promote business growth in Northeast Japan,” he explained. If Slush Tokyo taught us anything, it is that interest in cryptocurrencies is booming despite – or because of – the fact that the prices of several major cryptocurrencies have recently fallen to their lowest levels since last December. “The next Bitcoin is here somewhere,”  , the chief cryptographer at Ripple, stated in between posing for photos with cryptocurrency fans at the opening-night event of Slush Tokyo on Tuesday, 27 March. The hype, however, is justified because cryptocurrencies are fundamentally an attempt to solve actual problems, such as how to reduce the time to settle (cross-border) payments from days to seconds and how to bridge the various isolated payment systems in use today. The World Economic Forum (WEF), similarly, has   that experts and executives expect roughly 10 per cent of the global GDP to be stored on blockchain technology by 2027. Yet, a number of challenges remain for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. The regulatory environments must be developed and harmonised, a balance must be found between user freedoms and protection, and the general public must develop a better understanding of the concept and technology. The tendency to view cryptocurrencies as investment vehicles rather than transaction mediums, on the other hand, may not be as big a problem as is often suggested. “Speculation drives many kinds of industries […] and product development,” reminded  , the director of operations at ConsenSys. One of the multiple challenges digital payment protocol developers have set out to address is the monetisation of the Internet. The current, advertisement-based revenue model is “broken” as it has resulted in web users resorting to ad-blockers and content producers to ad-blocker detectors,  , the chief technology officer at Ripple, said in the opening keynote speech on Wednesday. “The current [ad-based] revenue model is nothing more than a bypass of a fundamental problem,” he said, pointing out that there is presently no direct, reciprocal interface between the user and owner of a particular website. “Ripple’s Interledger Protocol,” he added, “could be the answer. The payment protocol utilises ledger-provided escrow to enable secure payments across different ledgers through untrusted connectors, thus facilitating interledger payments.” “True reciprocity, from content producers to consumers, is now possible,” he stated. Virtual and augmented reality were another dominant feature at Slush Tokyo – especially at the joint pavilion hosted by   and the  , where Finnish startups offered a glimpse of how such technologies have and will continue to transform the tourism, entertainment, advertisement and even manufacturing industries. , a programme director at Business Finland, pointed out that what sets these startups apart from many of their global competitors is their focus on developing solutions primarily for businesses. “Finland has produced a number of business-to-business solutions, while elsewhere companies are more focused on games and entertainment,” he told. “Scaling your business in the consumer space is really price-dependent.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/colloidtek-makes-a-splash-with-technology/,ColloidTek makes a splash with technology,"This Tampere-based startup identifies the fingerprints of liquids, to ensure qualitative consistency and thus save customers time, money and energy. A woman leans away from the counter inside a crowded nightclub to talk to her friend. As she turns back moments later, she notices that her drink is ready and waiting for her on the counter. She habitually rummages in her satchel for her smartphone and places it next to her drink. She is making sure the drink has not been spiked with any of the incapacitating agents unceremoniously called date-rape drugs. The glass is fitted with a plate no larger than a postage stamp that, powered by an inductive link, generates an electromagnetic field that permeates the contents of the glass, producing detailed data on the composition of the drink. The data are analysed in the cloud and the results sent to the end user. The woman checks her smartphone. She is good to go, it says. She slides her smartphone back into her satchel and obliges, taking a sip of her drink. “Our company logo symbolises the fact that every liquid has a unique fingerprint,” says Ilkka Sillanpää, a co-founder of ColloidTek. This is one exhibit of the multitude of potential near-future applications of a liquid measurement solution developed and commercialised by  , a startup founded last year by a group of scientists from the   and executives from companies such as  , Siemens and  . “What we’re doing is basically identifying the fingerprints of liquids,” summarises  , a co-founder of ColloidTek. “Every liquid has a unique fingerprint. No two are the same, just like no two human fingerprints are the same.” The startup has developed a probe for in-liquid and a plate for non-intrusive measurements. Both methods generate an alternating current electromagnetic field that causes the particles and molecules in the liquid being analysed to move. These can then be identified by measuring how much energy they absorb from the electromagnetic field. “This is what we mean by fingerprints,” explains  , a co-founder and the chief executive of ColloidTek. ColloidTek is presently focused primarily on the B2B area, serving a growing number of public utilities, industry leaders and research institutions. Its current customers include IDO Bathroom,  ,  ,  , the   and   (TVO). The customers typically use the solution to ensure qualitative consistency and develop a better understanding of their processes to save time, money and energy. Järveläinen reveals that the next step will be to expand into what he calls the business-to-crowd area by offering the solution to facilities such as customs, nightclubs and drug rehab clinics. This, in turn, should open the door to consumer markets in the not-too-distant future. “Internationalisation is also a goal and lifeblood for us,” he adds. The selling points are abundant. “Collo differs from the traditional methods. You used to have to take a sample of the liquid with a scoop, take the sample to a laboratory and wait two days to find out what the liquid was two days ago. We get the results immediately,” tells Sillanpää. ColloidTek’s Collo solution can be used to identify particles and molecules in almost any type of liquid in real time. He points out that because most of the comparable solutions in industrial use today are optical, they cannot be used to analyse suspended solids such as the ceramic mixtures used to make sanitary ware. “Our solution is also rather robust,” adds Järveläinen. “You can immerse it into a paint container and it won’t be the least bit bothered if the sensor gets dirty. It’s also durable and needs no maintenance.” It is therefore no surprise that interest in the patent-pending technology is booming. “We’re generating sales even though we don’t have a dedicated salesperson and even though we’re still in the prototype stage. That’s an indication of how much demand there is for Collo,” says Järveläinen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/skincare-with-ux-is-child-s-play-for-alva-organics/,Skincare with UX is child’s play for Alva Organics,"How can a skin cream for babies be like a Swiss army knife? What does it mean for a cosmetics product to be future-proof? Finnish Alva Organics has the answers. For a lot of parents, the toy giraffe Sophie la girafe is a quintessential memento of their baby’s early years. The 60-year-old French toy, made of natural rubber, is chewed on by infants all over the globe. Sophie la girafe Cosmetics products are designed by Jonna Jalkanen and manufactured by a subcontractor in Latvia.  is the co-owner of a company that imports the toy to the Nordics. At some point, her partner mentioned that the brand was looking for licensees to come up with products that could carry the name of the iconic giraffe. With a background in luxury cosmetics, Jalkanen realised this could be her way of creating something that’s her own – exactly the way she likes it. “Back then, natural cosmetics brands weren’t as good as I wanted them to be,” she explains. “Sometimes, the smell could be very strong, they didn’t absorb very well, and the texture could be very thick. When it comes to children’s products, a lot of the packaging and visual elements don’t seem well thought through to me.” Jalkanen rolled up her sleeves and started developing a cosmetics concept based on Sophie la girafe. She had everything ready, from paper bags to press materials, when she presented the idea. All was designed to respect the decades-old brand of the internationally loved toy. The rest is history – or well, future. Although   products by Jalkanen’s company   were launched in 2013, it’s only early days for what Jalkanen plans for the brand. User experience, UX, is one of the buzzwords in the technology world. Jalkanen, who is responsible for all Sophie la girafe recipes, wanted to make the products as usable and pleasant as possible every step of the way – essentially bringing UX to the heart of the matter. The product range will soon grow with a hand soap and lip balm and later sunscreen. “For example, our creams and lotions absorb very well and quickly, and a single bottle or tube lasts for a long time,” she tells. Another thing that’s very important to Alva Organics is to not have any allergens on its ingredients list ( ), ever. Jalkanen deems it crucial to stay on top and ahead of what’s bubbling under in raw materials and ingredients to be sure that even as recommendations for children’s skincare products change, Sophie la girafe Cosmetics remains future-proof. The driving force is making products for babies that are good enough for adults that tend to go for luxury cosmetics brands, the likes of Dior or Chanel. For this reason, there are no generic tubes with stickers on; each Sophie la girafe item is in bespoke packaging, designed to add to the elegant feel. Hence, it’s probably unsurprising that Sophie la girafe is, despite its branding, not used only by babies. “About a half of the users are adults,” Jalkanen says. “For example, many people with atopic skin and other skin conditions find relief with our products. Some even have said that they’ve been able to reduce their use of cortisone creams significantly with our SOS cream, which we like to call the Swiss army knife of skin care.” Wanting to please the customers of Dior and Chanel sounds like something that comes with a hefty price tag. Jalkanen doesn’t think so; in general, the cost per Sophie la girafe Cosmetics product is around 20 euros. “We really want to make the best possible products for all families, and that means the cost can’t be too high,” she notes. “For a lot of people, 20 euros is a lot of money.” Sophie la girafe Cosmetics products have received a range of international awards. Some resellers have, according to Jalkanen, said that the products offer the best value for money in their whole selection. Jalkanen acknowledges that this might, in a way, be a problem. “I’ve been told that not everyone expects Sophie la girafe Cosmetics to be of such high quality, because they’re not very pricey,” she says. The good news is that international juries can’t be fooled with money. Last year, the army-knife-kind SOS cream   a cosmetics Oscar prize by CosmétiqueMag. At the moment, Sophie la girafe Cosmetics products are available in about 35 countries, including in the UK through Harrods in London and the department store chain Selfridges. The biggest markets are Sweden and Finland, but other regions are catching up. “For example, the Middle East is a very interesting area for us, as well as Japan, Hong Kong and the US,” Jalkanen lists. There are plans for a maternal product series too, and some other companies have asked for Alva Organics to provide them with turnkey cosmetics solutions. Jalkanen assures that at this stage, the door is open to all possible options. However, first she wants to see the giraffe fly – even if not as high as its original namesake. “I know of a man walking into a department store desperately asking for ‘that toy giraffe’, because it had been lost and the baby just wouldn’t stop crying for it,” she tells laughingly. “Some parents say that their baby would probably choose Sophie over their mother!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/halipuu-sees-the-trees-for-the-forest/,Halipuu sees the trees for the forest,"A forest isn’t a vertical storage for raw materials. Halipuu in Finnish Lapland wants people to connect with trees as they are: living things we share the world with. “ ” was only 12 years old when he first chopped down a tree in the forest next to his home in Veitservasa, near the village of Sirkka in Finnish Lapland. The forest was a part of his upbringing ever since his parents were allowed to redeem the piece of land to compensate for the estate in Petsamo they had to leave after World War II. Forests and nature are a quintessential part of Finland’s brand in tourism, too. Halipuu wants to support Finland’s image as a friendly, down-to-earth and a little quirky country. Over 60 years later, the time for clear-felling was approaching. Except that Pappa didn’t feel up for it. “It was Easter and we were sitting by the fire in the forest,” Pappa’s daughter,  , recalls. “Dad was feeling down about the thought of the trees being gone and mentioned, in passing, that maybe we should adopt them.” There was no need or time for business strategies or mind-mapping a market segment analysis. Raekallio-Wunderink instantly thought that adopting a tree would be a great idea. Seeing them get killed didn’t feel right for her either. “I’ve always seen trees as something much more than a mere material. To me, it feels terrible to watch giant, beautiful creatures being chopped down.” To Raekallio-Wunderink, like her father, the forest is a place for calm and quiet. A little over a decade ago, she and her Dutch husband decided to move to Sirkka to be close to family – and, at the same time, the trees.  (‘hugging tree’ in English) was founded in 2015. It does exactly what it says on the tin: lets people adopt a hugging tree in Lapland. “It’s a way to create an escape for people who might not have an opportunity to visit a forest otherwise,” Raekallio-Wunderink explains. “For a lot of people, the everyday life can be very detached from nature and they have no time to stop and breathe. The still presence of trees is a reminder of the connection we should have with our environment.” The cocooning tour is one of Halipuu’s specialities. Adoption contracts last for five years, after which the fee is nominal. The tree can also be decorated, seen live on Halipuu’s Periscope account and, of course, met in “person”. Halipuu organises trips to the woods, but the few-hectare Halipuu forest can also be visited by the “owners” of the trees on their own. One of Halipuu’s specialities is an   cocooning tour, where people listen to the quietness of trees whilst relaxing in a hammock. The trees serve even those who lack the chance to adopt a tree. The forest has a nominated Worry Tree, ready and willing to carry people’s concerns on their behalf. People from all over the world can send their worries to Halipuu in writing, and they are brought to the woods to be burned and the ashes then scattered at the roots of the Worry Tree. The tree will convert the worries into oxygen – and life. Customers can either adopt a whole tree or take part in a group adoption. In all cases, the tree actually exists. “You don’t adopt just   tree, you adopt   tree which you can recognise, visit and feel is your own,” Raekallio-Wunderink emphasises. Things have moved on at a steady pace for Halipuu; Raekallio-Wunderink hasn’t really needed to put effort into marketing, as word has been spreading through social media and international media visits. Companies have taken the opportunity, too. For example, Finnair has added hugging trees to its webshop, and plenty of other collaborations are in the pipeline as well. Adoptions pop up from all over the world. One of Raekallio-Wunderink’s favourite stories is about a man living in Tokyo. “He adopted a tree, because his wife had described the trees to him so beautifully. He’s blind, so he wasn’t able to see it for himself. One day, he’s hoping to come and touch his tree; and we’d be thrilled to welcome him here.” Halipuumetsä (Halipuu forest) is an important place for the whole Raekallio family."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sleep-easy-valpas-squashes-the-bedbug-problem/,Sleep easy – Valpas squashes the bedbug problem,"Finnish startup Valpas has found a novel way to prevent bedbugs from contaminating hotel rooms, and is now setting its sight on beds worldwide. Souvenirs are an integral part of the travel experience. Whether it’s a tee-shirt or trinket, there are myriad ways to bring a piece of your holiday home with you. Bed bugs: the core focus of Valpas. The company is setting out to disrupt two industries at once with a team that has already proven themselves in the industry. Then there are the not so nice reminders of your time away. Aside from whopping credit card bills, evidence of bedbugs is perhaps the least welcome takeaway from a trip.  can vouch for this. Returning from a dream trip to South-East Asia four-and-a-half years ago, he swiftly realised that some unwelcome stowaways had tagged along for the ride. “My girlfriend had these bites and thought we had brought bed bugs with us,” he recalls. “She wouldn’t give me peace of mind until I got the pest controllers in.” Once the company set to work fumigating their apartment, Gois quickly became frustrated with the pesticide solutions being utilised. Yet there was no non-chemical alternative available. His irritation spurred him into action, leading to him establishing Finland’s first heat treatment system in 2013 with his fellow   classmates. As the enterprise gathered momentum, the budding businessmen couldn’t shake a niggling truth that reared its head when tackling these unwelcome creepy crawlies. “The issue of bedbugs has a stigma attached to it: it’s the biggest least talked about problem in the hospitality industry. We realised that the real issue is not extermination, but prevention.   was born out of that insight.” All of the company’s founders studied at Aalto University. “The idea of Aalto is when you combine business, engineering and design, you get great teams that create innovative and valuable concepts,” Martim Gois says. “We’re living proof of that.” Currently, hotels’ bed bug detection is typically carried out manually, either by housekeepers or the guests themselves. According to Gois, Valpas’ solution hopes to leave this analogue approach without a leg to stand on. “The hotel replaces its existing bed legs with our smart bed legs. If any bugs are introduced to the room, they are captured inside an integrated trap in the leg which prevents them from doing harm.” All bed legs in the whole hotel are connected via a smart Bluetooth mesh network, the result of a collaboration with Finnish company  . This sends real-time room status updates and notifications of prevented incidents to the Valpas web app via a single gateway. The low-energy Bluetooth network also means that batteries don’t need to be replaced on a regular basis, further facilitating ease-of-use for hotel managers. “A battery’s lifetime is up to six years, and a hotel bed is replaced every 5-10 years,” Gois points out. The solution provides 24-hour tracking, seven days a week. This constant state of alertness also informs the company’s name. “  is a Finnish word which means being aware and being awake,” Gois explains. “The solution is built for those aware and awake travellers and hotels that want to make the most out of their travel experiences.” Last year, the company raised a 120 000-euro pre-seed round from Reactor Ventures, Icebreaker.vc and an angel investor. “We pitched it as a completely out of the box idea,” Gois says. Now it’s time to eradicate bedbugs around the world. The company has established an office in Dubai and is set to collaborate with seven leading hotels in the city, seeking to capitalise on the luxurious range of accommodation in the world’s fourth most visited city destination. Closer to home, Gois remains hopeful that Valpas’ fresh solution will enjoy rapid Europe-wide expansion. “The hospitality industry is super conservative; there has really been nothing new since the minibar,” he observes. “Once someone introduces an innovative product to both hotels and guests, it can spread pretty quickly.” Looking to the horizon, the company also foresees the solution being applied outside hotels. Whatever the accommodation type, student housing or otherwise, Gois underlines Valpas’ overall goal of improving public health. “If someone chooses to work, then they might as well work on something that has a positive environmental or social impact,” he outlines. “If we manage to keep hotels safe and give travellers peace of mind, this is something super useful and valuable for the whole world. Our vision for the long term is to advance happier travel in a more holistic way.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cubicasa-floors-us-market-with-3d-property-mapping/,Cubicasa floors US market with 3D property mapping,"An accurate digital floor plan can be time-consuming to create. But what if one could be derived automatically from a smartphone video? Finnish innovation is making this a reality. Pictures, property details and a floor plan. These are the things most of us look for when scanning property ads online, whether it is to rent or buy. But while digital floor plans are the norm in many markets, in places such as North America they are still a rarity. For Oulu-based startup   this has proven to be a tremendous opportunity. “We want to solve the problem of indoor property mapping using data anyone can collect,” explains CEO   “We are creating a more advanced and cost-efficient service than anything available today.” Cubicasa is off to a good start. Its eponymous online platform uses artificial intelligence to turn almost any layout data into a digital 2D floor plan or 3D model. This enables a real estate agent to upload a hand drawn layout of a flat to the service and have a full-blown 3D visualisation ready the next day. “Finland is a small market, but it is a great place to innovate and develop services,” says Harri Pesola. Cubicasa has already captured the interest of real estate agents, brokers and developers in Finland and the US, with half of its revenue coming from across the Atlantic. But it is the next version of the platform Cubicasa is really banking on. It will automatically transform smartphone videos into digital floor plans. “We have a very automated production line running behind our online service, but it cannot process video yet. So this is what we are developing now,” Pesola explains. “We are working with the University of Oulu and their machine vision experts to make it happen.” Cubicasa is already testing the video feature with some significant US partners. These include one of the country’s largest real estate companies, Marcus & Millichamp, and brokerage firm Halstead Property. There are still a few kinks to smooth out in the new technology, but Pesola expects the service to be ready for commercial launch by the autumn. “We are in a good situation since our distribution channels are growing and new customers are signing up for our existing platform every month,” Pesola says. “But when we launch the new service, we’ll shift to an entirely new sales gear in the US market.” Cubicasa, founded in December 2014, has targeted international markets from day one. As soon as the startup secured its first investment in 2015, its founders Pesola and   flew to the US to scout the local competition. Pesola believes the US is a market where you have to be physically present, and for Cubicasa this approach has paid off. The startup has raised one million euros in funding, and last year it became the first non-American company to be accepted into Moderne Ventures’ real estate accelerator programme in Chicago. “They held monthly events all around the US and would arrange one-to-one meetings for us with various real estate industry influencers,” Pesola recalls of the experience. “Those were very efficient meetings. You got instant feedback and sales opportunities.” Today Cubicasa has 17 employees across three offices in Oulu, Helsinki and Palo Alto, California. Also on the startup’s roadmap is a sales office in either Chicago or New York and a turnover of 10 million euros by 2020. But while Cubicasa has set its ambitions high, Pesola stresses that what makes or breaks a company in the end is its people. “It should be fun to do this. Actually, that is the primary goal,” he says. “Of course turnover is crucial, but why I became an entrepreneur was to do something that really appeals to me and to do it with a great team.”"

The heart-warming tale has made an impact on screens from   to  . Meanwhile, Vilhunen’s 2017 documentary   did as its title suggests: made waves worldwide with its depiction of Finnish youngsters’ hobby. “For the girls in this film, hobbyhorsing is a real way to cope with not only the pressure of growing up but some of the bullying that comes along with it,” the director  .

Providing Finland’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film on four occasions, he received his widest applause yet for his sensitive and thoughtful output in 2015’s  . Echoing this, Härö puts his hands together for the local scene. “Among Finnish directors there is a feeling of mutual respect,” Härö  . “There is a really big thirst to throw yourself in, make contact and find co-workers and develop as film-makers.” Balancing Nordic and American sensibilities, Karukoski broke through onto the international stage with his fifth feature,  .

Narrated by the director’s great-grandmother, the film was recognised with a number of accolades, including the Grand Prix prize at the Northern Character Film & TV Festival in Murmansk. “I’m very surprised and flattered by the award,” the director  . “It’s great that a film about Skolt Sami legends and history has been acknowledged in such a wonderful way in Russia.” Never give up on your dreams – Finland’s first superhero film,  , is living proof of this. A decade-and-a-half into a marketing career, this director turned to the sketches of his youth after an unfortunate turn of events. It was time to learn by doing. “I had a vision, but no knowledge or experience,”  , just before the film was released in some 40 global markets. “I was pursuing my dream and didn’t have time to stop and think.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/grainsense-brings-innovation-to-the-field/,GrainSense brings innovation to the field,"With its handheld device, Finnish company GrainSense makes it easy for farmers to measure the quality of their grain, allowing them to make better decisions about their produce. You might think that being a farmer is a pretty simple job: You attend to your crops, feed the animals, harvest your fields and sell the produce. And you repeat the same tasks year after year. Right? For the first time, farmers now can have access to accurate data about their own produce. Wrong. Being a farmer means making hard decisions and being constantly faced with difficult questions, such as: What is the right price for this year’s produce? How much protein is in this season’s crops? Which field should be harvested first? Enter  . With its new device that measures the quality of grains, the company gives farmers detailed information about their crops, helping them make informed decisions. GrainSense’s device is based on three innovations: First, it uses the same technologies as laboratory machines but fits them into a smaller piece of hardware. Second, the device can be calibrated for different types of grain, making its results more insightful than mere raw data. And finally, it is the world’s first handheld device for analysing grains, so it is easy for farmers take it with them to the field and measure the quality of their crop even before harvest. The device is easily transportable. This means that, for the first time, farmers can have access to accurate data about their own produce, putting them at the same level with big industry players such as mills, which have sophisticated tools for analysing the grain they buy. One crucial piece of information concerns protein, says  , GrainSense’s CEO. For grains to be used for baking, their protein content has to be above a certain level; otherwise they will be used as animal feed, in which case the farmer gets a lower price for their grains. “If you measure your grain before harvest and know that their protein content risks being just below the threshold, you could give the crops a final boost of fertiliser,” says Krogius. “Or if you know that grain from a specific field has a high level of protein, you know not to mix it with lower quality grain.” This also affects meat producers: “If you raise pigs, for example, you want to make sure the animals get plenty of protein from their feed,” Krogius says. GrainSense’s origins are at the state-owned research centre  , where the company’s founder   began developing a portable measuring device for the agriculture industry. In 2014 the product was spun off into a private company, and early this year GrainSense launched its device. The firm is now concentrating on the Finnish, Swedish and the Baltic markets, with plans to expand soon to other European countries. Operating internationally was self-evident from the start: “This is a world-class device, and our ambition is to make it available to farmers around the world,” Krogius says. The device can also analyse rice, soy and peas, which could later open up new markets in Asia. Beyond just helping farmers, GrainSense is motivated by much larger trends that shape global food production: “In the next 30 years, globally we’ll need to produce 70 per cent more food. But the area available for doing this will not expand,” Krogius says. “So, in the future, the focus in food production will need to be more and more on quality rather than quantity.” “This makes agriculture such an interesting industry to work in. At the end of the day, we are in a far bigger context than selling measuring devices.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/brella-connects-the-dots-in-business/,Brella connects the dots in business,"Be it love or professional life, we all know how difficult it can be to find The One. Finnish company Brella wants to make sure people leave business events with more than just a bag full of flyers. , a software entrepreneur, used to go to all sorts of events related to business and entrepreneurship. Most of the time they were, at least in theory, interesting, but there was one problem: at the end of the day, he had his hands full of flyers and brochures, but no phone numbers or concrete proposals. “For example, if you’re looking for someone who could mentor you to take the next step with your business but don’t have anyone specific in mind, finding the right person in the crowd is pretty much an impossible task,” he says. “This is especially the case when you keep running into people you know and start exchanging courtesies. It’s time-consuming and not the reason you went to the event in the first place.” Back in 2012, Kauppinen started contemplating ways in which participants could cut to the chase. Initially, thinking was all there was, as Kauppinen was focusing on his former business and finishing his studies. Then   expressed interest in the idea and offered to give some money to see it develop.  , with Kauppinen as its CEO, began blowing at full steam in 2016. The idea is to give event organisers a tool to serve attendees and, at the same time, give people more incentives to pop by. “There are two reasons to go to a business event: the content or the programme and the people,” Kauppinen explains. “In general, the most important value comes from the people you meet. Conferences and fairs are essentially just really big markets of people.” For Kauppinen, one of the best moments in Brella’s history was realising people really are loving it. “That’s when you know you don’t have to be ashamed of your product.” To use Brella, an event organiser needs to create a profile for the happening on the platform. The app can serve as the event’s handbook, too, by including schedules, maps and introductions. Then, the participants add their personal profiles, telling others what they have to offer and what they are looking for. “For example, if you’re really passionate about a certain programming language, Brella will help you find fellow enthusiasts,” Kauppinen tells. This saves a lot of time for everyone, as people can book meetings and start chatting well before the event even starts. It works in a lot of cultures, too – just for different reasons. “In Finland, people don’t tend to approach strangers as openly, whereas in the US, you end up shaking hands with absolutely everybody. In Finland it can be difficult to meet people, and in the US it can be difficult to meet the   people.” Although Brella has no means to monitor the end results of the agreed meetings, some success stories have made their way to the headquarters. Kauppinen has heard about people who’ve found their dream job or made their record in daily sales with Brella’s help. “I also know someone who sold their company at a meeting set up through Brella, without ever having planned to do so.” It’s not just individual participants that reap benefits out of Brella; the app boosts business for event organisers and their sponsors as well. “Brella is a new channel for visibility and systematic networking,” Kauppinen says. “It helps event organisers understand what their audience is interested in and how to serve them in the most meaningful manner.” Event organisers pay Brella an annual license fee for using the software. At the moment, there are users in over 40 countries – and counting. The list of customers includes names such as Tech Crunch, Microsoft and Samsung. The largest markets are Europe and the US, where Brella has offices in New York and San Francisco and where most of its sales efforts now focus on. This strategy will hold until 2020, but in a few years’ time, Brella will start eyeing Asia in a more serious manner. Kauppinen also hopes to see the current 14-strong team double in size within a year – and this is not the only number on Brella’s target list. “Our vision is to become a global networking standard,” Kauppinen says. “By 2020, Brella will have been used at 10 000 events and enabled 100 000 000 business contacts.” Event organisers can add value to participants, sponsors and themselves by using Brella."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rakka-creates-immersive-stories-with-vr-360-video/,Rakka creates all-round immersive stories with VR,"Rakka Creative, a startup founded in Tampere in 2015, uses virtual reality and 360-degree video to create immersive, personal and emotionally captivating audiovisual experiences.  would much rather pull out his laptop and virtual-reality headset than attempt to verbally describe the cinematic virtual reality content produced by  . “I’ve tried to explain it hundreds of times,” he tells with a smile more indicative of appreciation than exasperation. “What we do is something you have to see and experience with virtual-reality goggles. I’ve yet to meet a single person who understands what we’re doing without seeing it first-hand.” The Tampere-based startup is currently primarily engaged in the production of marketing content for businesses from various industries by means of virtual reality and 360-degree video. “The projects are very different. The idea is that we allow the viewer to experience real environments while enhancing them with elements such as artwork, narratives, music and voice-overs,” says Huttu-Hiltunen, the company’s founder and chief executive. “What it does is removes the ad-like feel of the content.” Rakka Creative puts together a team ranging from a handful to dozens of professionals specifically for each of its productions. It is not the technological concept that is difficult to verbalise but rather what it enables: an immersive, personal and, consequently, emotionally captivating viewing experience unlike any other. “360-degree video enables a new, well-defined form of narrative that gives a new role to the viewer and can be used to tell different kinds of stories. Because it’s really the first new form of narrative for 100 years, it’s taking people a while to grasp what it’s really about,” tells Huttu-Hiltunen. He predicts that although cinematic virtual reality is expected to become a well-established format following the proliferation of head-mounted displays, it is likely to remain something of a niche because the stories it is used to convey are more personal and because the viewing experience is not as social as that for traditional film. “I’m certain it’ll be used. The need for that kind of narrative content will increase slowly but surely,” he affirms. “But my vision isn’t necessarily related to how big a thing this will become. There’s a lot of talk these days about what will be the next big thing and how everyone should be jumping on the bandwagon. That’s not a particularly appealing starting point for someone who simply wants to make great content.” Huttu-Hiltunen also draws attention to what he describes as a fascinating contradiction: numerous studies have suggested a correlation between the adoption of new technologies such as robotics and the diminishing ability of people to empathise with each other. Virtual reality, on the other hand, has been shown to have the opposite effect. “VR is sort of like an empathy machine,” he states. “It’s a means to share stories around the world about different people from different cultures in a way that’s interesting, entertaining and educational, allowing viewers to empathise with a variety of people. “It’s an opportunity to experience feelings that for many might otherwise be rather difficult to experience.” Rakka Creative has also developed a production format that takes advantage of the narrative strengths of the technology with a view to offering it to the owners of virtual-reality platforms around the globe. “The format is based on the fact that we’re able to create content that’s interesting specifically to the people who use the platform,” says Huttu-Hiltunen. “And the big thing about that is that the content is produced efficiently and finalised in a fraction of the time a big company would spend on it. So, it also creates cost savings.” The startup, he confirms, has made a conscious decision not to trade away scalability in order to offer tailor-made content for every client. “Our challenge is getting a foot in the door and showing our work to the right people because that’s the only way to make it clear that this isn’t just another hype. We’re no longer demoing technology or demoing some wonderful video format, but we’re having an emotional effect on people. And that’s something you can use for a great deal of things,” tells Huttu-Hiltunen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-wooden-construction-and-design/,Five for Friday: Wooden construction and design,"Given the fact that 75 per cent of Finland’s land area is covered by forest, it is no wonder that its green gold has been exported around the world in various shapes and sizes.  Recently,   organised a media tour for Chinese journalists, together with the  , to showcase what Finland is made of in wooden construction and design. During the tour, journalists got to see how wood has been used in various types of public buildings such as churches, kindergartens, apartments, cafes, saunas and a concert hall. As Finnish wood expertise is attracting growing interest in China, these companies provided shining examples of how Finns have embraced their ‘green gold’. Stora Enso is the forerunner in wood modular construction and offers advanced engineered wood products such as LVL (laminated veneer lumber) and CLT (cross-laminated timber). As the global biggest supplier of CLT, Stora Enso believes in the future of wood for the construction business. “Growing population, global warming, urbanisation, digitalisation, changing lifestyle and eco-awareness all make the demand for sustainable business bigger than ever,” says  , business development manager of building solutions from Stora Enso Wood Products. With the principle “nothing goes wasted”, by-products of the sawing process can be used to produce pellets that serve as a source of sustainable energy. Furthermore, the company’s environmentally friendly, non-toxic, wood-based adhesive that bonds single-layer panels together, Lineo,  “. Founded in 1958 by five brothers residing in the forest with the shared dream of having everyone in the world living in Finnish log houses, Honkarakenne became the world’s first industrial manufacturer of log homes. “Finnish pines are the building materials with best qualities. They are organic and natural, dense and strong. All our wood comes from PEFC-certified forests, so they are also 100 per cent renewable,” says  marketing director of Honkarakenne. “They are like naturally breathing walls that can absorb and release moisture and heat. Logs keep indoor air quality at an optimal level, and according to research they also create a stress-reducing environment.” Only renewable energy is used during Honkarakenne’s production process, in which all surplus materials and waste are harnessed as energy. Until now over 85 000 log structures have been built worldwide in the shape of log cabins, restaurants, holiday resorts etc.,  . Honkarakenne’s upcoming projects include 35 log-built daycare centres in Finland and a ski resort in China. Being one of the first companies to develop thermowood as an innovative wood treatment method sometime in the 1990s means that this company is a global market leader. The thermal modification of timber makes it durable with superior weather endurance. “Therefore, it can be used outside without any equipment, for any weather conditions, which is very special for a wood product,” says sales director  . “Besides, there are no chemicals used during the production process, only heat and steam used for producing thermowood, so no resin will seep out – even in a heated sauna.” Combining solid quality, decorative possibilities and Nordic design, Lunawood Thermowood has appealed to customers in over 40 countries. “The prime quality of Lunawood Thermowood can be shown from the fact that even though Russia has its own big wood business, they still buy thermowood from us,” says Heikkinen. Named after a little village where the founder’s grandfather was born, this company is a leading wood interior decoration and exterior cladding provider. It only uses PEFC-certified wood and was the first company in Finland to be granted a certificate for priming and top-coating panels. Its topcoat wood siding combines wood processing and specific paint technology. All panels are pre-painted at the factory, which increases building efficiency and leaves no odour on site. One popular interior panel product line, Pala, enables users to decorate their interior wall by gluing the desired shapes and pieces to the wall with adhesive, as a do-it-yourself concept. “Anyone who doesn’t have special skills and experience in this can easily do it,” assures company CEO  . Finnish architects continue to showcase how wood can be used in combination with other materials to create architecturally impressive, yet human-centred spaces and environments. One prominent example of utilising this abundant resource is Helin & Co. Architects. “Wood has always been the main building material in Finland, as we haven’t had much choice, so we have a long heritage of using it in all kinds of buildings,” says  , design director of the company. “Wood is sustainable and renewable, and when taking care of forests properly, we have an endless supply of materials.” Helin & Co. Architects’ extensive portfolio includes both small and big-scale projects, from a shed on the Turku Archipelago to the awarded modular offices Finnforest. Several other contemporary architect offices have also demonstrated their exceptional skills in dealing with wood, such as Oopeaa that  , JKMM which designed Viikki church and Think Corner of the University of Helsinki, and  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/spektikor-signals-a-change-for-emergencies/,Spektikor signals a change for emergencies,"Designed for mass casualty situations and hazardous environments, these disposable heart rate monitors provide real-time patient assessment.  The device works up to 20 hours in all conditions and is able to monitor small changes in the patient’s heart rate. Natural disasters. Terrorist incidents. Even though global headlines are seemingly choked with more death and destruction than ever before, there is at least some reprieve in sight for those who rush into the immediate aftermath of such occurrences: first responders. Finnish company  ’s disposable heart rate monitors provide patients’ vital signs in just 20 seconds. “Currently there is usually only one ECG or monitoring device per ambulance,” says CEO  . “If there are multiple people injured, it is not possible to assess everyone. We offer a quick situational awareness of the patient map.” Measuring the width of two business cards, Spektikor’s lightweight device is quickly attached to the patient. The LED indicator is then placed in plain sight, providing easy monitoring of vital signs via different coloured lights that indicate the patient’s status. By speeding up the process and enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple patients, survival rates are enhanced as first responders and paramedics can prioritise patients quickly. “For chaotic emergency situations where there is a lot of noise and potential casualties, our devices are really simple to use,” Kuronen underlines. It weighs merely 32 grams, which is considerably less than versus the six kilograms of a typical ECG-device. The roots of Spektikor were planted in the northern city of Oulu in 2010. The first edition of the device flowered two years later, after extensive testing with the Finnish Defence Forces. “We concentrated on the disposable side; if the device is contaminated by blood or chemicals, you can just throw it away,” Kuronen says. “We have since sold over 2 000 devices, mainly to military and emergency service providers such as ambulance, fire and police. We do business in niche markets.” The device works in all conditions, from the scorching heat of deserts to frigid cold of the North Pole, and thus Spektikor has also begun establishing a presence in international markets. The company’s biggest customer in the UK is the National Ambulance Resilience Unit, and it also collaborates with mountain rescue there to help treat hypothermia patients. “Once the orange bag is shut from head to toe, there is no visual contact,” Kuronen explains. “Our LED indicator is visible over the top of the bag and the patient can be monitored.” Kuronen also points out that the company has NATO approval for the device, so it can be procured in all NATO countries. Spektikor’s simulator helps first responders and paramedics prepare. The Red Cross and NGOs are also potential customers given the recent abundance of refugee camps that are putting a strain on facilities worldwide. According to Kuronen, the company hasn’t come across any competitors thus far. It should find out soon enough, however, with 2018 the year when it makes a big international push. “The next few months is a market sprint and deep customer validation in Europe,” he says. “The Japanese market is also very interesting, mainly because of the unfortunate number of natural disasters there. We are now negotiating with a huge company there.” Spektikor’s small team can’t be everywhere, and therefore it is looking for local partners who know about domestic markets and can help it with approval processes and sales. “Hopefully in a year from now we have started in Japan and are in more European countries,” Kuronen says. “Germany is one of the biggest untapped markets for us, as is Turkey.”"

With over 1 000 kilometres of coastline, Finland has always had to have a close relationship with the sea in order to transport people and goods. Here are five different examples of how this proximity is enabling a range of Finnish companies to thrive. With winter temperatures which can plummet below -30C, it is not surprising that Finland is known for its icebreaker expertise. This knowhow was most recently showcased in Polaris, the world’s most environmentally friendly icebreaker, which also  . “All the significant elements in Polaris come from Finland, including the dual-fuel engines, propulsion units, building and design,” Aker Arctic managing director  . “Finland is clearly the leading country when it comes to designing and building icebreakers.” This clean technology and marine engineering company has patented a mechanical sail allowing vessels to harness wind power to cut both costs and carbon footprints. The Flettner Rotor may have been around for over 100 years, but Norsepower has given it another lease on life. “This is cleantech at its cleanest,” CEO   earlier this year. “The technology’s potential to reduce an industry’s total carbon emissions is simply staggering.” Finland’s former capital city Turku boasts  . But this is not a city stuck in the past: it is an epicentre of shipbuilding innovation in areas such as autonomous maritime traffic. The One Sea ecosystem combines local expertise in the form of research projects, technological development and policy advocacy. One member is engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which has also  . “In Finland, we have two significant factors: a robust ICT cluster and a very strong marine cluster particularly in the Turku region,”    , vice president of sales and marketing for ship intelligence at Rolls-Royce. The Port of Helsinki has grown to become the busiest passenger port in Europe in 2017, and is also the number one general port for international freight traffic in Finland. Meeting growing demand by opening a new terminal last year, the port is showing no signs of slowing down. “In recent years, shipping companies have introduced larger and faster ships for the Helsinki–Tallinn route, while also increasing their passenger capacities during peak seasons,”    , director of passenger harbours at the Port of Helsinki. All ships sailing under European flags are now required to undergo certified demolition. For the Finnish maritime industry this presents a major opportunity, as it has significant experience in handling large ships in a way that is sustainable both for the environment and for the workers.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cuckoo-workout-gets-you-off-the-chair/,Cuckoo Workout gets you off the chair,"All work and no play makes all of us dull. Cuckoo Workout boosts wellbeing and thus productivity by encouraging office workers to (literally) shake up their day a little.  Excess is never good. Not even when it comes to something as harmless-sounding as sitting in a chair. “There’s plenty of evidence to show that sitting too much without changing position, moving and stretching is detrimental to health,” says  , CEO and co-founder of  . “I think the dangers are often overlooked, and it’s definitely something we should talk about much more than we do now.” Lehmonen noticed this in her very first sit-down job four years ago, interning as an events assistant in an office. She, together with another intern  , realised that their energy levels started to plummet after a few hours behind the desk. The duo decided to set a regular alarm. Every time it went off, they would stand up and do 100 jumping jacks to get their blood pumping. Most of the people in their office joined in, and Lehmonen was surprised to notice how well it all worked. “You could really tell the difference in productivity,” she notes. “Although I admit it must’ve looked hilarious from behind the glass wall, watching a group of office workers jump up and down in sync!” Cuckoo Workout users have reported that the short exercises reduce their back and shoulder pain. It didn’t take long for Lehmonen and Mänty to get the show on the road. Just two weeks after the idea first came about, they had already reserved the web address for Cuckoo Workout, an app that uses videos to guide office workers to exercise and stretch a couple of minutes during the working day. The company was registered in 2014, and with some funding the first demo version was launched the same year. Things were progressing promisingly, but then something dramatic ground things to a halt: the company’s one and only software developer suddenly passed away. “That really shook us. We had to glue things back together again.” The next backlash was just behind the corner, as Cuckoo Workout faced financial difficulties the following year. Fortunately, the journey continued with a group of investors. The luck turned: fast-forward to 2018, and Cuckoo Workout is used by multinational companies in about a dozen countries. The founders wanted to gamify the app to make sure people get emotionally involved, too. During her internship, Lehmonen noticed the little exercise moments had, on top of making people move, significantly improved the atmosphere and team spirit in the office. Hence Cuckoo Workout lets individuals, teams and companies compete against each other, with regular prize draws for best performers. “For example, a global company’s office in Ecuador can compete with an office in Finland,” Lehmonen explains. “It increases the feeling of community and togetherness even when the teams are far apart.” Lehmonen points out that Cuckoo Workout is not only a way to encourage workers to look after themselves in order to reduce sick leaves and injuries, but also a form of employer branding. “Just like companies want to provide their employees with tools and practices that increase efficiency and make working easier, they ought to look after the wellbeing and motivation of their employees as human beings,” she says. Also, companies competing to recruit the best talent should remember that many of today’s young professional pay attention to their employer’s social responsibility efforts. Cuckoo Workout also offers its clients a chance to support children to exercise by offering them access to Cuckoo School app designed for kids. “Children’s exercise levels have gone down, and it shows,” Lehmonen tells. “By encouraging them to get on the move now, we can really make a difference in their later life.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/zoan-is-in-the-zone-in-vr/,ZOAN is in the zone in VR,"Helsinki-headquartered ZOAN has been involved in some of the most ambitious virtual reality projects in Finland. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the opportunity to learn, believes  , the founder and chief executive of  . “We don’t want to do every single virtual reality project in the world, but we want to do the ones that are a bit more difficult and challenging, that really force our team to break boundaries,” he proclaims. The Helsinki-headquartered virtual reality (VR) studio has certainly adhered to the principles of its founder. The equipment needed to experience another reality. It has produced a virtual time travel experience for  , allowing museum visitors to not only step into but also interact inside a portrayal of the opening ceremony of the 1863 Diet by  . “The National Museum project was special in that we set out to create realistic human characters – which many said was sheer madness – and ultimately succeeded, even though it did take quite a lot of work. We enjoyed it because such a challenging project helped us to move forward as a company,” says Rosendahl. Bringing Moominvalley and its beloved residents to life in virtual reality is another exciting project for ZOAN, which was named the official virtual and augmented reality partner of   in March. “We’ll create additional content for the upcoming television series,” reveals Rosendahl. “We’ll tell different kinds of stories to enable people to get to know the characters better and see and experience things in Moominvalley.” “The project has stirred up a great deal of interest. A Japanese fan has already said she plans to move there permanently.” Miikka Rosendahl, the CEO of ZOAN, believes most people will furnish and decorate their homes with the help of VR in the near future. ZOAN’s success has not come overnight. Rosendahl has over the past seven-and-a-half years assembled a team of professionals around him from three continents to transform what was originally a one-man operation into a VR studio with annual net sales of 900 000 euros and a total of 32 staff members in Brazil, Finland and the US. “We started growing rapidly some three years ago, after which we’ve doubled our revenue each year,” he tells. A central building block in the growth has been the real estate industry. The industry has embraced VR as a means to show residential and commercial units in buildings that have yet to be completed or are scheduled for a thorough refurbishment to potential buyers and tenants. “Real estate is still the largest segment for us. It’s clearly where we’ve grown and been able to operate profitably, which has allowed us to also expand to other business segments,” says Rosendahl. ZOAN, he reveals, will launch a campaign to recruit top talent from overseas later this year in anticipation of what should be a surge in demand for VR content. “If Google and Facebook deliver on their promise to bring one billion people to VR, there’ll be an enormous need for new contents. Virtual travel will definitely be part of that. It can be an interesting way for people who can’t travel due to financial or physical limitations to get to know the world and different cultures,” envisions Rosendahl. The vast possibilities have not gone unnoticed for others, either. In Finland, for example, the number of companies involved in virtual, augmented and mixed reality development has  , according to the  . Rosendahl believes the companies should recognise each other not as competitors but rather as pieces of the same ecosystem. “We think you’re on the wrong track if you start talking about competition in a country the size of Finland,” he says. “It’s much more important to create value for the entire VR ecosystem, which has global growth potential.” “We can produce world-class quality. And if we take the right steps, we have an opportunity to create larger, global companies,” he affirms. “What sets us apart is our ability to create high-quality and interactive content. Our budgets may often be relatively small, but our production methods enable us to do three to four times more with the same sum of money than our competitors abroad.” As the official VR partner of Moomin Characters, ZOAN has been tasked with recreating Moominvalley and its beloved characters in virtual reality."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/dagsmark-petfood-lets-your-dog-eat-local/,Dagsmark Petfood lets your dog eat local,"What we put on our plates reflects our values – and so does what’s on our pets’ plates. Dagmark Petfood has created a very Finnish alternative for quality-conscious dog owners. The story begins like that of so many growth companies before:   and   wanted to buy something that wasn’t yet available. Both were not only serial entrepreneurs, but also dog enthusiasts. The product is fully Finnish. “Pekka called me in the summer of 2016 and said he doesn’t like feeding his dogs dry dog food shipped from abroad,” Strömberg recalls. “He asked me if I thought this had some business potential.” Strömberg, with a background in academia, business, food and dog products, wasn’t difficult to convince. Both she and Siivonen-Uotila had started prioritising Finnish produce in their own diets a long time ago, and they were fully aware that they weren’t the only ones. It felt natural to want to do the same with pet food. “The dog food business is pretty disastrous ecologically,” Strömberg explains. “The sacks travel immense distances, and you can’t be 100 per cent sure of the quality and cleanliness.” Thus, the idea not only was in line with Strömberg’s personal values, but also made business sense. “Regular food trends tend to move on to pet food with a few years’ delay. We figured the time is finally right for  .” Right after the first phone call, Strömberg and Siivonen-Uotila started to build a team. The five-strong group of founders boasts a multi-disciplinary background: one knew everything about the food business, another was an expert in market research and so on. Laura Strömberg believes that the time is ripe for a brand like Dagsmark Petfood, as consumers are growing increasingly aware in their daily choices. The first recipe was developed whilst looking for funding for setting up a factory. The first production unit was built in the village of Dagsmark, by converting a machine that used to make cheese puffs. “We had all done all sorts of things in life, but dry dog food never,” Strömberg tells laughingly. “It was hit and miss, trial and error in the beginning.” In August 2017, the first Dagsmark Petfood variety, Dagsmark Häme, hit the shelves in Finnish supermarkets all around the country. The name, referring to a region in Finland, is a clear indicator of the origin of the ingredients. It was clear from the word go that the brand won’t be a specialist store exclusive. Both Strömberg and Siivonen-Uotila deem it important that people can shop for their pets whilst getting their regular groceries. “When the product is available through big, national chains, it automatically means large volumes and thus the price can be moderate.” The price tag isn’t the only thing kept small. Strömberg says that the list of ingredients is deliberately kept as short as possible. “We only use food items that are of high enough quality for human consumption. Everything comes from nearby, and we make sure that all ingredients are on the list for a reason, so that they’re not just fancy names but actually carry nutritional value.” In Finland, being local produce is a strong selling point for Dagsmark Petfood. However, the founders, as well as investors, believe in the brand’s international appeal. “Even in Finland, authorities have been delighted that because our product is fully Finnish, it must comply with Finnish regulations,” Strömberg notes. “As Finnish food is world-famous for its purity and high quality, it can be trusted elsewhere too.” First, Dagsmark Petfood will test the waters in neighbouring Russia and Estonia. Other countries might follow suit, as a result of the company either exporting its products or setting up factories abroad. “That might be a far-fetched thought, but it’s too interesting for us not to at least look into it,” Strömberg says. In the nearer future, the selection of dry foods and treats will expand. A new top-notch factory will start production later this year, which is good news for the global market, too. “For internationalisation, production capacity might form a bit of a bottleneck. Soon, that won’t be a problem.” The new factory, being built in Karijoki, Finland, will mean that the production capacity will be sufficient for international markets."

Just last month, the world’s largest industrial event Hannover Messe 2018 took place in Germany, which got us thinking why the Industrial Internet has become such an intriguing thing and, of course, where Finland stands in the new ball game. What is interesting is that our understanding of the Industrial Internet evolves all the time. According to  , who works as a programme director at Business Finland’s Industrial Internet programme, this is mainly because the potential use cases have only started unfolding. Smolander – along with a group of Finnish tech companies – was present at Hannover Messe, browsing the latest solutions and observing what the future holds for the Industrial Internet. “The number of underlying use cases and things that can be connected to the Internet is almost limitless,” Smolander says. “This was also apparent at our Finland pavilion, where we had companies ranging from   and   with their smart industrial indoor air quality and trace heating solutions to   with its online liquid analyser.” Yes, you read that correctly. It is possible to even bring the Internet to liquids. In direct relation to the first point, the new use cases are not always complicated – quite the contrary. For reference, you do not need to major in information technology to understand why Finnish companies  ,   and   have teamed up to launch a so-called  . Sensors and related applications can help service providers like Lindström to take better care of washrooms, which ultimately leads to higher customer satisfaction. As  , business unit director at Lindström, underlines in the case video, “studies show that the cleanliness of washrooms affects the whole image of a shopping centre”. New technology can easily sound complicated or distant. Most of the time, however, it is actually simple. Probably the most common misconception about the Industrial Internet is that it focuses only on technical efficiency. While it is true that implementing IoT solutions can – and most likely will – increase the efficiency of a given industrial process, that is only the beginning. What follows are new business models and services. British engine manufacturer   is a widely known example. The company used to focus mainly on manufacturing aircraft engines, until it discovered the IIoT. As of now, instead of selling whole engines  . The wide scope of the Industrial Internet guarantees that innovative SMEs have a large role in the game. No matter how exciting a flexible all-encompassing IoT solution sounds, there is no such thing. Rather, taking advantage of the Industrial Internet requires a combination of solutions that can be compiled based on the use case. “The Industrial Internet value chain is complex,” says  , a programme manager at Business Finland’s Industrial Internet programme. “This is where Finnish SMEs come into play. They form a comprehensive network, supplementing each other with interoperable solutions. So, they can provide the needed flexibility, as each of them covers specific parts of the long value chain.” According to Smolander, Finland has deep roots in communications and mobile technology as well as a long industrial history, supporting its prominence in the Industrial Internet, which in essence is a combination of the aforementioned. “The emergence of the ecosystem and the network of companies is definitely among Finland’s strengths,” he says. “Naturally, it has taken some time to evolve. 20 years have gone by since forest machinery provider   started to utilise the IoT in its daily activities.” “Since then, our Industrial Internet expertise has been cooking up,” Smolander says with a grin. “Nowadays, I am proud to say that we are pretty good in it.”   is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Business Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ones-spreads-joy-all-over-the-globe/,ONES spreads joy all over the globe,"Wherever you happen to be in the world, children are natural-born artists. Whilst their creativity flows free, Finnish company ONES makes the resulting art benefit entire communities. If your business idea is based on children living in slums working for you, someone might accuse you of using child labour. Finnish   has a pretty good comeback, though: their product should, if anything, help children avoid such fate. Vanessa’s design won a drawing competition, and is now able to contribute to her family’s income. “Kids love to draw,” co-founder   says. “Seeing their drawings worn on the other side of the globe is empowering and brings pride and a sense of self-respect to them, and often to the entire family.” ONES uses drawings by children living in hardship for designing prints for clothing and accessories. The first artists, such as eight-year-old football-loving   and 10-year-old  , live in a slum in Brazil. Each purchase supports the young designers’ families and communities. For example, the roof of the family home of slightly disabled eight-year-old   has been fixed with the income generated by selling a shirt with a print designed by her. “Initially her family didn’t believe she could learn to read or write,” Seppälä says. “Now the whole family is incredibly proud of her, and she feels she has been able to make a difference.” The shirts are made of organic cotton, reducing carbon footprint wherever possible. For Susanne Seppälä and her partner  , entrepreneurship was a dream in the making. The idea for ONES came out of an episode of  , a TV show in which entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to investors in the hope of financing. “We saw one of the entrepreneurs present a similar idea and immediately figured it could be something for us, too,” Susanne Seppälä recalls. Both had had regular day jobs, but they didn’t really feel right. “We appreciate the liberty you get by being your own boss,” Jarno Seppälä says. “At the same time, we’ve had an urge to help, but we haven’t been sure who and how.” Suddenly it all fell into place: the couple happened to have a few friends in Brazil, including one who was already working with children in slums. She agreed to help with local connections and ensure the money, a slice of the proceeds of each item and half of overall profits, goes where it’s supposed to. “We knew human trafficking is a serious issue in Brazil. Many boys end up in gangs and girls are at risk of prostitution,” Susanne Seppälä notes. “That’s why our mission is to change to world, one shirt at a time.” It’s not only the youth of Brazil who reap the benefits of ONES. The products are manufactured in India in accordance with Fair Wear Foundation’s ethical terms, such as living wages and no child labour, and they’re made of organic cotton. The printing is done in Ulvila, Finland by the founding couple. ONES hopes to make everyone smile. However, despite the sometimes-grim circumstances surrounding its creations, ONES is deeply rooted in joy. The Seppäläs wish that their shirts can bring happiness to people across the supply chain. “From the cotton fields to slums to seamstresses and us here printing the shirts, all the way to the people wearing them, we hope they make everyone smile,” Susanne Seppälä tells. The end users can buy a shirt knowing who has created the print and exactly where it was made. The Seppäläs also emphasise the very high quality of the products: buying a ONES isn’t just a charitable act, as the products are also durable and comfortable – not to mention nice-looking – pieces of clothing. So nice that when the founders last visited the US, people were stopping them to ask where their shirts are from. ONES is now mapping foreign markets to expand the production and to help more children. Other kinds of expansion plans are in the pipeline, too. ONES is neither restricted to just Brazil nor only children. “We’re currently looking for contacts elsewhere in the world, such as Romania and Bulgaria, where ONES could help underprivileged children and communities,” Susanne Seppälä explains. “Maybe one day, ONES will have its own factory, employing people who would otherwise struggle finding employment.” For Susanne and Jarno Seppälä, entrepreneurship is a dream come true."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/linkker-is-on-a-road-towards-a-greener-future/,Linkker is on a road towards a greener future,"These innovative people movers bring together energy efficiency and electrification, digitalisation, and automation, and are making tracks internationally.   is at the forefront of what according to one of its founders could be one of the more monumental changes in the modern world: the electrification of transport. “E-mobility is truly a global phenomenon,” states  , a co-founder and chief financial officer at Linkker. “It’s a major theme wherever you go because urbanisation is taking place everywhere and because emissions are a problem everywhere.” The Lahti-headquartered company has, despite its relatively young age, succeeded in developing and manufacturing electric buses that outperform the alternatives offered by its larger competitors in energy efficiency, operational performance and environmental friendliness. “We’re frontrunners in energy efficiency and operational performance,” Granvik proclaims. “Our objective is to grow rapidly specifically in electric public transport and become one of the leading suppliers of electric bus systems.” “Linkker’s value proposition is to provide an emissions-free public transport system in a cost-efficient way while improving the passenger experience,” says Linkker co-founder Tom Granvik. Linkker owes its frontrunner status to primarily two innovations: a lightweight aluminium unibody bus design made by Kabus, a subsidiary of  , in 2005; and an energy-efficient driveline developed by faculty and students at   in Helsinki in 2007. The two innovations were brought together to build an electric bus under a project co-ordinated by the  . “The bus was benchmarked against commercially available electric buses in 2013,” recounts Granvik. “The results were promising especially in terms of energy efficiency – which leads not only to lower energy costs but, more importantly, to lower battery and charging infrastructure costs – so promising that they gave the impetus to found a company to commercialise the technology.” He tells that the outwardly bold decision to not only develop and license the technology but also manufacture electric buses was easy because, unlike diesel buses, electric buses are not marketed predominantly on the merits of the engine. “What’s important is how the bus performs as a system: the mileage, passenger comfort and life-cycle costs,” he elaborates. “It was the only option. Otherwise we’d have to make too many compromises when it comes to the system performance. Every detail of our design has been optimised and is crucial for the performance: the lightweight unibody construction, energy-efficient driveline, vehicle-control software, IoT-based fleet-management solution and related applications.” The Linkker 12+ LE bus boasts an impressive set of metrics: an energy consumption of roughly one kilowatt per kilometre, charge time of two to four minutes and daily mileage of up to 350 kilometres. Electric buses not only are particle and exhaust emissions-free but also produce less noise emissions. Granvik reveals that the driveline has been optimised for opportunity charging, allowing the bus to receive rapid blasts of power – at rates of five to eight kilowatts per minute, which are not tolerated by depot-charging buses – at the terminal points of the route. The difference between the two types of electric buses – depot and opportunity-charging buses – is that the former are fitted with massive batteries and charged only before the start of daily operation. “The problem is that equipping buses with such large batteries makes them expensive and heavy, which places a bigger strain on the battery and raises both energy consumption and life-cycle costs,” says Granvik. “The daily operating range is cut very short because of the increase in energy consumption. A typical range is around 150 kilometres.” Linkker, he adds, is a global leader in this respect. “Our buses can be charged in two to four minutes. The charging becomes invisible as far as the timetable is concerned. The buses can operate on a tight timetable and the daily range can rise to 350 kilometres – as it has in Turku, rain or shine.” Linkker has already supplied buses to Espoo, Helsinki and Turku in Finland, and to Copenhagen, Moscow and Singapore. Orders have come in also from Luleå, Sweden, and Malaga, Spain. “These are no pilots. All of them are in commercial operation,” underlines Granvik. “Every project has enormous potential: Helsinki alone has roughly 1 300 buses that are gradually being electrified. The Europe-wide forecast is that electric buses will  . This is truly a rapid change.” The change is driven especially by cities that strive to become greener and smarter to create more attractive urban environments for residents, businesses and investors alike. Linkker has also equipped the buses with technology that allows it to collect data on their performance, malfunctions and various traffic situations, and utilise the data to develop the system and operations further. “Our vision consists of three steps: energy efficiency and electrification, digitalisation, and automation,” reveals Granvik. “What we’re doing is using digitalisation to make the system smarter. Once it’s smart enough, we’ll move on to automation.” In addition to Finland, Denmark, Russia and Singapore, orders have also come in from Sweden and Spain."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-cleantech/,Five for Friday: Cleantech,"Finland is renowned for being a leading tech hub and for having the freshest air in the world. It’s no surprise, then, that the country is also a leader in cleantech innovation. Clean technology, or cleantech, has taken the mantle of Finland’s biggest industry in recent years, with a range of products and services that boost performance whilst minimising the damage done to the environment. Energy and resource efficiency is one of the pillars of cleantech. Given the prevalence of cooler months here up north, it’s unsurprising that an innovative approach to heating has emerged from Finland. This local company offers an automated solution for buildings heated by water radiators that helps limit the amount of wasted energy and can be controlled in the palm of your hand. “With Fourdeg, people can tune their own indoor climate as they wish, within certain safety limits,” CEO    . “They control it via the phone or pad app, adjust every room and can make a schedule.” Removing clogged up dirt – known as ‘fouling’ – in industrial processes and heat exchangers has always been a cost- and time-intensive process. But instead of using mechanical tools or hazardous chemicals, Altum has harnessed something less invasive and more efficient for the job. “With our system, all you need is our externally attached ‘power ultrasound’ device,”   Altum CEO  . “It emits high-power ultrasonic waves into the machinery, which break up fouling without any production stoppages.” Cleantech represents a significant market opportunity when it comes to energy, water, waste and mobility challenges. Solved offers a systemic approach to deal with these complex challenges by connecting customers and their stakeholders with a global network of over 1 500 leading multi-disciplinary sustainability experts. “In order to tackle the issues in an optimal way you need to access the best people and talent around the world and bring them quickly together,” the company’s    . “We have built a big expert network and have a collaborative platform which enables our clients to get the best possible team across company borders.” Nocart delivers distributed power plants combining solar, wind, bio and other energy sources, as well as energy storage for utility-grade electricity production. The company has had particular success in Africa, with significant deals landed in Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and Nigeria. “As I have said before, the opportunity for Nocart in Africa is huge and our pipeline has grown to 1.3 billion euros worth of projects,”   Nocart CEO  , after a 14 million-US dollar order for a 10MW grid-feed solar plant was received from an independent power-producing company in Kenya. A consortium of 14 Finnish maritime companies and five research organisations recently pledged 13 million euros to further digitalise the Finnish maritime ecosystem towards a smart and green future. The purpose of INTENS is to equip the Finnish maritime value chain with digital solutions and build a competitive edge for the Finnish maritime cluster in energy-efficient and low-emission shipping. The project will run from 2018 to 2020. “The collaboration and funding from INTENS project allow us to create market-leading voyage planning services, with the potential to reduce 30 per cent of yearly shipping CO2 emissions,”  , director of development at NAPA Shipping Solutions,  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vainu-takes-the-lead-with-award-winning-sales-platform/,Vainu takes the lead with award-winning sales platform,"This AI-driven, cloud-based online sales prospecting platform allows companies working in B2B sales to narrow in on which leads to contact. A tram depot stands a stone’s throw away from Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium. It has since been converted into a cultural centre, and late last year, in an auditorium flanked by retired trams and their wooden destination signs,   convened some 400 prospective and current clients. They gathered there to talk about how to keep making more sales. “We’re building software for a modern, systematic salesperson, which entails coaching our clients and potential clients along their journey,” explains  , one of the three founders of Vainu and its current COO. “They’re also a way to thank our customers, as they’re free.” The company has offices in Helsinki, New York, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Oslo. In some ways Vainu’s journey actually started across the Atlantic. Honkanen was working in San Francisco between 2012–2013 while  , Vainu’s CEO, worked with European and American customers in Helsinki. They were responsible for sales and account management respectively. With the traditional problem of sales prospecting amplified in the largest market in the world, they both felt a lot of time, and hence money, was being needlessly wasted. Four years later, Vainu opened up an office in New York. “Those first slide decks we drew up in 2014 still hold true: we haven’t had to pivot from how we approach the problem,” tells Honkanen. This approach involves using AI, named-entity recognition and natural language processing to gather open data on companies through websites, media mentions and recruitment literature at a pace and scalability previously impossible. Vainu in Finnish refers to an animal’s superior sense of smell, and for years has been used to describe an apt salesperson with a knack for the craft. Here we have Vainu’s office dog Stella. It has helped Vainu gather information on over 150 million companies. Neural networks and machine learning help cleanse and supplement these data. All of this is very much the territory of the third founder  , a seasoned developer who has sought to build an industry-leading tech team around him. Vainu’s technological needs are met in Helsinki, in house, with key members of the team dedicated to theorising about AI full-time for the good of the cause. Vainu’s approach has taken it far in a short span of time – to date, the company has over 1 500 businesses subscribed to the service. These include big players such as Microsoft, HP and Adecco. Having never sought external investment (and being the proud winner of Best Bootstrapped Startup and the People’s Choice Award at last year’s Nordic Startup Awards), it’s no surprise Honkkanen seeks to distinguish Vainu’s company culture from your average startup. “Some startups call themselves a family whereas we like to think of ourselves as more of a team,” he says. “Kind of like a sports team, we’re hungry for growth, results and success.” It’s clearly a supportive environment too, as 24 of the original 25 recruits from back in 2014 still work for the company. With six offices across five countries, employees aren’t raring to give up their seats on a rocket ship determined to gather more knowledge about companies everywhere than any other. And, with annual recurring revenue approaching 10 million euros, it seems they also have every reason to stay. The three founders have known each other since the age of six, having gone to the same primary school. Vainu’s first employees are now partners."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/reddit-puts-alvar-carto-on-the-map/,Reddit puts Alvar Carto on the map,"This Finnish startup launched a free phone wallpaper generator that blew up on Reddit and successfully boosted the profile of its raison d’être: customised map posters. Earlier this year,  ’s software developer   was faced with a difficult choice: work or pleasure. Internet traffic to the company’s phone wallpaper generator had become so heavy that the servers kept crashing. Understandably so, when tens of thousands of users were trying to access it at the same time. Needless to say, the sweaty palms of Brunfeldt and his fellow founders   and  were complimented by furrowed brows. Yet when it came time for Brunfeldt to leave for basketball practice, he made a surprising decision: rather than wrestle with the problem any longer, he opted to go shoot a few hoops instead. Then he made another left turn: telling Reddit users what he was doing. Alvar Carto boosted market awareness by offering its service as a free phone wallpaper generator and promoting it via Reddit. Rather than explode in fury of frustration, 3 000 users immediately gave him the thumbs-up, applauding his decision to put his personal life ahead of his profession. This was just another unexpected response that had greeted the small startup in short succession. “We originally put it on Reddit just to try it and didn’t think it would be a big success; a few downloads here and there,” Eriksson tells. “All Hell broke loose.” Indeed. Along with the 500 000 visitors that arrived in just a few days, hundreds of thousands of background images have now been downloaded. Yet for all of the Reddit-related bluster and excitement, up until recently the free wallpaper generator was nowhere near being on the map for the trio. Alvar Carto is actually in the poster business, and had sought a different way to market its customised map service and branch out. “Basically, you can type in any city in the world on our website, choose your style and order a custom-made poster,” Eriksson says. The entire premise is do-it-yourself. Users can pinpoint the exact location they would like to have hanging on their wall by searching, zooming in and panning on OpenStreetMap with street-level precision. A handful of styles and colours to choose from broaden the palette. Once the user has tweaked the design to their satisfaction, Alvar Carto sends it to industrial printers for a hard copy. The matte-finish poster is then mailed anywhere worldwide. “We’ve gotten really good feedback. People choose locations where they got married, where they were born, where they met their first love or something like this,” Eriksson says. “Every product has a story behind it. That’s usually pretty cool to hear.” And the most memorable example of having their ear bent? “There was one women who said, ‘Hey guys, I met my husband 20 years ago on a ferry. Do you know where   travelled between Finland and Sweden on this day at midnight?’” Needless to say, that after some consultation with the ferry company regarding routes and mark speeds from a historical perspective, the exact coordinates were deduced and image created and posted, in an impressive display of sleuthing. “We’re just a mapping company, but we’ll get anything done,” Eriksson says, with a laugh. The company’s name is a play on words of revered Finnish designer Alvar Aalto. The groundswell of interest generated by Reddit has had a knock-on effect to the main business. “The stunt increased our sales five-fold, so it really has had a huge impact,” Brunfeldt says. “Now, we are already making a profit. There are only a few steps left to being able to do this full-time.” In order to put the right foot forward, the trio are now reaching out to the world. “We have been planning to go country by country so we get to know the scene one at a time,” Brunfeldt says. “Germany and the UK are where we are most probably going concretely. Japan is another possible market.” Brunfeldt also points to the fact that the company already ships worldwide. Therefore, there are no foreseeable limitations in logistics or production. “The funny thing is that the majority of our sales come from the US at the moment,” Eriksson adds, “even though we use metric centimetres and euros, and we haven’t optimised the website at all for the public.” Nonetheless, the Reddit stunt also stirred up interest from marketing agencies that want to develop their position in the US market and further afield in China. Now, all the trio have to do is choose which one will help them. Given that anyone can use OpenStreetMap, one wonders whether the trio are ready for their idea to be duplicated. Been there, done that. And then some. “Someone in our Facebook group found a way to make these maps for free,” Eriksson tells, with a smile. “She went to our page, pressed print screen and then copied it by hand, square by square.” Given that their Facebook page has 70 000 followers watching their every move, was their first reaction to call the cops? “We laughed and thought it was fun that someone would put in this much time and effort, but it was going to take her at least a few weekends to complete. We decided to just give her the map, and wrote to her that we love your enthusiasm, so here’s a free one.” The service uses OpenStreetMaps for its cartographic content; the exact location to focus on and its design is entirely up to the user."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bad-santa-serves-cocktails-in-scoops/,Bad Santa serves cocktails in scoops,"Oh summer, the time for ice cream and cocktails outdoors! What’s best, Finland’s Bad Santa lets people enjoy both in one spoonful. Let’s make this known from the beginning: although it is ice cream and has the word Santa in it, this product is not for children. “We are extremely serious about this,”   CEO   states firmly. “All of us founders are fathers, and even if we weren’t, we’d still make this very clear.” Bad Santa liqueur ice creams are like cocktails in a tub, their flavours ranging from honey rum and whiskey coffee to pear and salty liquorice. Each 200-millilitre portion of the gelato contains 3.8 to 4.2 per cent of alcohol, so it’s about the same as drinking a regular lager. This makes the boozy ice cream essentially a new summertime treat for adults. “Our aim was to create a drink in the form of an ice cream,” Lönnqvist explains. “Hence we’ve chosen the first flavours from well-known cocktails, but other options are cooking up, too.” “Bad Santa is meant to be enjoyed right after purchasing, and it tastes best in the sunshine,” says CEO Jens Lönnqvist. The story of the brand begins at the foundations of Lönnqvist’s home. In the middle of the night, he and co-founder   were doing some serious DIY at the house-to-be in Naantali, Finland, when Koivunen started to reminiscence about a time he made ice cream for his friends by putting alcohol and ice cream base in an ice cream maker. “He said it was delicious and mentioned it’s a pity he never turned it into a business,” Lönnqvist recalls. “Then he suggested I should try it too and maybe we really could give it a go this time.” Laughingly, Lönnqvist requested a sample. Only a few days later, the blokes got together for a different type of DIY – this time, in the kitchen. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ice cream tickled Lönnqvist’s fancy. The two grabbed the phone and called  , who was invited to join the company. Bad Santa was founded by the trio in 2016, the first batches being literally handmade by Koivunen. Things have escalated since: this June, Bad Santa will multiply its production when its very own factory becomes operational. Lönnqvist has a few good reasons to expect Bad Santa to become a bit of a hit in its home country. Finns aren’t famous for saying no to a cheeky drink or two, and, despite the chilly climate, Finland consumes more ice cream per capita than any other European country. However, the company is headed to international waters right away. Sales in Estonia will commence at the same time with Finland, and other countries are being mapped all the time. Bad Santa targets restaurants, cafés and events as well as regular retailers. Bad Santa has created a whole back story for the alter ego of Santa Claus. Southern European countries like Italy and Spain are of particular interest, as Lönnqvist is hoping to establish the brand in countries where the restaurant terrace season is a little longer than in Finland. In all honesty, that’s pretty much anywhere in the world. “Bad Santa is meant to be enjoyed right after purchasing, and it tastes best in the sunshine, so terrace weather is good for business,” Lönnqvist notes. Finland is part of the brand not only through high-quality local ingredients, but also in the name: Santa Claus is one of the globally best-known Finns. Lönnqvist says Bad Santa has developed a whole alter ego for the traditional Father Christmas figure. The founders are aware that for example the logo might raise an eyebrow or two. However, provoking conversation is not a bad thing for a new firm – and they have a message to send. “Even in all his goodness, Santa Claus is still a humane character.”"

The Smarp platform enables employees to exchange information via social media, engage with industry and organisational content, as well as suggest other interesting topics. Now the company is  , after closing a funding round led by London-based VC Nauta Capital. “Our platform is very scalable and brings benefits to anyone from small startups to global giants, no matter where they are located,” CEO    . Using an innovative, automated system, this company helps companies and brands to get a handle on their social media efforts by assessing their presence across the pillars of similarity dialogue and visibility. This then provides a perfect way to assess a company’s reputation. “There is a growing understanding that reputation is absolutely crucial for any company,” co-founder . “Some say that reputation is the single most important factor in the success of a firm.” With companies increasingly finding clever ways to reach prospective customers via social media, these marketing channels are also rife with harmful content. Facebook advertising in particular represents something of a free-for-all. Enter BrandBastion, offering constant “real-time protection of brand reputation and ad performance on social media,”    . “There are a lot of things that the brand or companies need to be aware of immediately,” she explained. “Social media is existing 24/7; it’s hard for many companies to have in-house monitoring.” These days, there are countless examples of social media content being used online without proper compensation or even permission. And the problem is only growing. BCaster believes its AI-powered mobile media platform can turn the situation around. Let’s say you capture a major accident on your phone. You upload the video to the BCaster app where it is automatically analysed, priced and embedded with copyright information. A journalist looking for footage of the accident can easily find your video based on its time and place and purchase the usage rights with a few clicks. “Our AI makes the whole process fast,”   founder  . “When you take a photo or video [using our app] it can be found in our search engine within seconds. In that time, our AI has dug out what or who is in the picture, where it was taken and when.” This company enables brands and publishers to create social magazines, applications and websites which combine editorial, curated and social content. A brand can engage its audience by allowing them to contribute content through any social media service by using a specific hashtag. The platform also enables content to be viewed on large advertising displays and TV broadcasts “The key to this is enabling a kind of ‘360-degree publishing’ where the same content can be shown everywhere from big screens and ad breaks to a company’s own website,” CEO and co-founder    ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/plugit-finland-wants-to-power-cars-worldwide/,Plugit Finland wants to power cars worldwide,"The Finnish company aims to be at the forefront of the rapidly expanding industry of electric transport. There might not be many on the roads yet, but it’s increasingly obvious that electric cars will one day be an important part of how we get around. And as they become more common, the need for charging electric cars will also increase. This is where   comes in. The company provides electric vehicle charging solutions to housing co-operatives, employers and other companies, specialising in white-label solutions that allow other firms to bring charging services to their customers. For example, retail chain Motonet is opening new electric car charging stations during this year at its shops around Finland. Similarly, retailing conglomerate Kesko has opened charging stations at various K-citymarket hypermarkets and other locations around the country. Both firms collaborate with Plugit. The company also sells its solutions to individuals, who typically seek to buy and install a charging device at their home following the purchase of an electric car. “New electric car owners tend to have a lot of questions about charging,” says  , Plugit’s director of sales and marketing. “We’re experts in the area, while traditional electricians rarely have extensive knowledge of the topic.” Turnover grew to 3.6 million euros between 2016 and 2017. Founded in 2012, the Tampere-based firm has so far focused only on the Finnish market, with promising results: the company’s turnover grew from 1.6 million to 3.6 million euros between 2016 and 2017. “Finland has been a great country for us to test and refine our business model, and we wanted to have a solid standing here before expanding abroad,” says Aaltonen. With foreign markets now in its sights, Plugit took a major step forward earlier this year when it was announced that the firm would install 50 charging stations in Singapore for local electricity retailer Red Dot Power. The company hopes this deal will serve as a stepping stone for entering other markets, and conversations are taking place in many other countries in the region, says  , Plugit’s CEO: “We have two conditions when deciding which markets to go to: there has to be an active ‘smart city’ initiative and a high penetration of electric cars.” Although electric cars form only a fraction of the overall car population in most countries, Plugit is convinced that their number will skyrocket in the near future – at a rate that will probably surprise many. Take, for instance, regulatory measures: The EU has set steep emission reduction targets for new cars already for 2021, which will greatly boost the production of electric and hybrid cars. And in Finland, the government’s expressed goal is to have 250,000 electric vehicles on the roads by 2030 (currently there are about 9 000, says Aaltonen). The culture around electric cars is also changing, and, once labelled elitist, they are little by little entering the mainstream. Big car manufacturers will soon introduce a wider range of products aimed at the average consumer, according to Aaltonen. “When electric cars become more common, our goal is to be able to provide a charging process that is so simple that people with no interest in the tech itself are comfortable with it,” he says. This is one of the reasons why Plugit is investing heavily in its software, which the company sees as a long-term investment. “We’re also building algorithms that will allow for efficient distribution of energy in various circumstances and to different kinds of vehicles,” says Saarela. “That’s our vision.” The company now has foreign markets in its sights."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/yetitablet-is-a-screen-for-teams/,Yetitablet is a screen for teams,"Finnish company Kuori has created a device that brings people together, be it in kindergartens, at construction sites or in nursing homes. We’ve all been there: immersed in our own devices in company or almost walked into a lamppost whilst looking at a screen, detached from the world around us. Smartphones and tablets seem to, at times, steal all of our attention.  and  , co-founders of  , figured this doesn’t need to be the case. Their hypothesis was that smart gadgets could actually help us communicate with the people who are with us here and now. The couple with three children, all diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), had come to notice that interactive lessons in multimedia classrooms played a crucial role in helping their children learn and communicate. The mastermind of Yetitablet, Jarkko Jokinen, promises that anyone who can use a smartphone is capable of using Yetitablet, too. “In general, tablets are pretty individualistic,” Maria Jokelainen says. “Which is fine – that’s what they were designed for. However, if everyone could see what happens on the screen, the technology could be utilised for teamwork and collaboration.” Unfortunately, no suitable solution was available on the market. That didn’t kill the idea, though: Jarkko Jokelainen, who has served in high IT positions in various corporations, built his first gadgets and computers when he was only 10 years old. He made the first version of Yetitablet with his own hands. The goal was to create a large, intuitive and versatile tablet that’d help children learn and play. Yetitablet didn’t work as planned. It worked better. “As we started testing the first versions, it was mind-blowing to notice how multiple uses we could think of,” Maria Jokelainen recalls. “As long as we made it as open and interoperable as possible, there seemed to be countless possibilities of what can be done with it.” Yetitablet, coming in sizes ranging from 27 to 98 inches, functions as a smart screen and a smart table, depending on the position of the tilt-lift stands. Equipped with an open Android OS, it supports millions of applications, serves as a digital whiteboard and enables video conferencing. As we grow and gain visibility, Yetitablet will for sure find more and more uses in new fields, too. Whereas previous similar solutions have been mainly industry-specific, Yetitablet is deliberately as generic as possible. “Like a smartphone, it’s an application platform,” Jarkko Jokelainen explains. “When it suits various purposes, the user experience is more intuitive, and it also reduces the price.” Now, Yetitablets can be seen in shopping centres as interactive maps, at construction sites as platforms for building information modelling software, in schools and educational institutions as learning devices, and as tools for physiotherapists and occupational therapists in their work with patients. One heart-warming memory comes from a nursing home, where the Jokelainens thought the device could help with sharing information and schedules. “Suddenly, the residents were doing crossword puzzles, watching videos on YouTube and showing each other places where they used to live on Google Street View,” Jarkko Jokelainen tells laughingly. “For many older people, it is much easier to get used to using Yetitablet instead of a regular-sized tablet, because it seems like a television, only that you can touch it.” At construction sites, Yetitablet is a bit like huge old-fashioned drawings – but much more up-to-date and interactive. Now, Kuori receives all sorts of requests from all over the globe from people, companies and organisations keen to see if Yetitablet could suit their needs. Maria Jokelainen has been thrilled to see how the device inspires its users. Currently there are ongoing negotiations with possible partners and customers in Japan, the German-speaking world, other Nordic countries and the Middle East. For example, in May   that a pilot project involving Yetitablet had gathered plenty of interest in Jordan and many resellers have been found in the region. Finland’s reputation in education around the globe is indisputable. In Kuori’s case, the nation’s fame in technology helps, too. The design, as well as firmware development and all business-critical operations, takes place in Finland; only some component are manufactured in Asia. The ultimate goal is to one day be if not the only, but at least one of the household names in the interactive flat panel market. “As we grow and gain visibility, Yetitablet will for sure find more and more uses in new fields, too,” Maria Jokelainen predicts."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-design-shop-ships-pieces-of-happiness/,Finnish Design Shop ships pieces of happiness,"Finnish design carries inherent Nordic values, such as equality, functionality and simplicity. Finnish Design Shop picks the best bits and spreads them across the globe. “If you go on Amazon or eBay, you can be sure you’ll find whatever it is that you’re looking for,” Finnish Design Shop co-founder and CEO   explains. “We want to offer a carefully curated selection of products, only the best of the best, to anyone who’s intrigued by the Nordic way of living.” Finnish Design Shop sells lifestyle design products from brands big and small to over 180 countries. Last year alone, packages were wrapped and shipped to more than 80 countries. The number goes to show that there are plenty of people interested in the Nordic lifestyle. Kiiski doesn’t think this is a particularly surprising turn of events. Finnish Design Shop wants to help people build a Nordic-style nest wherever in the world they happen to live. “The Nordic values, like equality and closeness to nature, resonate everywhere,” he says. “The Nordic nations are famously some of the happiest in the world, so our mission is to share pieces of this happiness.” Kiiski stresses that this is not just a sales pitch. “In our work, the most important thing is to be able to stand behind our choices. That’s why we didn’t launch a webshop platform, but an independent channel, so that we can stay in charge and choose our own selection.” The story of Finnish Design Shop began back in 2004. The idea was born in the heads of Kiiski and his then-colleague, who decided that combining the rise of online shopping and the increasing popularity of Finnish design would definitely be a good idea. So much so, that as soon as the thought occurred, Kiiski ran to his computer and reserved the domain. “We didn’t have time for brand design workshops,” he admits laughingly. “Later, we’ve come to think that we could’ve chosen a less obvious name, but in all honesty, Finnish Design Shop is pretty brilliant when it comes to search engine optimisation (SEO).” Initially the focus was exclusively on Finnish products. Now, the scope has expanded to cover brands that suit the Nordic lifestyle. “We don’t want to detach Finnish design from the rest of the world,” Kiiski emphasises. “Rather, we want to bring it side by side with international design, strengthening its position in the global market.” Finnish Design Shop forms a family of design-related services, including its own publication. On top of making Finnish and like-minded design available to all corners of the world, Finnish Design Shop wants to expand its offering to include complementary services. For example, companies can order full interior designs compiled from the shop’s selection. Another complementary service is  , a website offering design-related content to shoppers and visitors. “We do believe that the content inspires people and hence boosts sales, too, but mainly it’s our way to serve our customers even more comprehensively,” Kiiski tells. The method works: all possible growth figures have continuously gone up ever since the shop was launched. Almost half of all sales come from abroad, particularly Europe, the US, Australia and Japan. At the moment, the teams in Turku and Helsinki comprise approximately 50 staff members. Just a while ago, the company established an executive management team, with Kiiski focusing on strategic development. The strategy is pretty clear. “Every year, we want to launch a new line of business and grow it,” Kiiski notes. “It’s incredible how many side streams there are running from the grand concept of Nordic Design, and they all stem from the same, positive values.”"

Across the world, plastics make up 85 per cent of marine litter. In order to tackle this problem, the European Union has proposed   that outlaw 10 single-use plastic products. These Finnish innovations can help stem the tide. Based on wood and natural adhesive, this biodegradable multipurpose packaging can be mass-produced using methods and facilities that now make plastic. The world has sat up and taken notice: the company has completed a   and been  ,  . Currently the focus is on cosmetics packaging, but the world waits for more. “We’re agile and ready to pivot and change our business model if needs be,” co-founder  . Some 100 billion plastic bags are used every year in Europe alone. This startup aims to substitute plastic bags with bags made from a new material based on wood fibre. This is just the tip of the plastic iceberg. “We have investigated flexible packaging for non-food items such as toys and toiletries; shipping envelopes for e-commerce deliveries; and posters, banners and labels for graphic applications,” CEO    . “The performance parameters of Paptic, such as flexibility and tear resistance, make it an attractive material for many uses.” This Finnish company is tackling the growing piles of disposable dishes that are littering the horizon. It has developed a water-based dispersion solution that could be used to create fully recyclable virgin fibre-based carton board suitable for food packaging, such as coffee cups. “If all goes well, in the future we will only be producing recyclable food service board,” CEO    . “It’s a growing and profitable business.” Unsurprisingly, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland appears on this list. First, it has   for the production of furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from plant sugars. FDCA can be used to produce items such as drinking bottles, paints and industrial resins. Second, VTT’s compostable and lightweight plastic-like packaging material was awarded earlier this year for combining cellulose films with different complementary properties. “In a new plastics economy, plastics will never become waste or enter the ocean in the first place,”    . “To get there will require new levels of commitment and collaboration from industry, governments, designers and startups.” Proving the old adage correct that all good things come in pairs, Metsä Board’s skincare gift box won first place at the Luxe Pack Shanghai Awards both this year and last year. Made from lightweight paperboard, the packaging was upgraded in 2017, reducing packaging material use by 25–30 per cent and offering a completely plastic-free packaging solution. , design and innovation director at Metsä Board, was delighted with the response to the upgraded solution,   the company’s intention to “inspire packaging designers and brand owners with new innovative solutions in packaging design and using renewable materials”."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/documented-zone-pays-money-for-thought/,Documented.zone pays money for thought,"Not all companies have taken note of the dormant capital lying in a well-made document – and not all companies know how to make one. Documented.zone is set to change that. There are two ways in which creating a document for company purposes can be either expensive or very expensive. “First, the creation process itself costs money, be it outsourced or in-house,” says  . “Second, if the final document isn’t very good and doesn’t serve its purpose, it’s just money down the drain.” Blomberg is the CEO and co-founder of Ceverte, a company behind a service called  . Its aim is to function as a marketplace for company documentation. Take, for example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May. Virtually each and every company has had to create guidelines and contracts to ensure its compliance with the new law and, inevitably, a lot of the work overlaps. Thus, if someone has already made an excellent FAQ or employee information sheet, with very little or no customisation it can be applicable in other organisations, too. “Well-made documents are part of a company’s dormant capital,” Blomberg explains. “Now, many organisations keep reinventing the wheel, when they could utilise the already existing ones.” “Well-made documents are part of a company’s dormant capital,” states CEO Martti Blomberg. Documented.zone is a prime example of various global trends: digitalisation, the sharing economy and the platform economy. The platform enables the sharing of digital documents all across the globe, providing some with the chance to monetise their content and others with a way to save money by streamlining content production. “We see it as a win-win situation for everyone, benefiting both those who have already come up with a solution and those who are still looking for it,” Blomberg tells. On top of the GDPR, all kinds of technical and other documentation can be bought and sold on Documented.zone. The topics vary from process, sales and the environment to directives and standards, to leadership and logistics. The sellers can be companies or individual experts, such as contract lawyers, who can also offer consultation as part of their documentation package. As many contract formats are legally required, it’s also safer for a company to buy the content directly from experts. Sometimes the documents can be used as is, but in some cases they can just serve as benchmarks or templates. For example, if a newly-founded company is looking to establish a communications strategy, it can use documents available on Documented.zone as examples or references as to what should be covered and what the content should comprise. Although Documented.zone is now riding on trends, the idea was born a fair few years ago, back in 2013. Some of the six founders had a background in management consulting, some in inventing, and all were well familiar with both how the need for documentation is vast and what a chore the creation process can be. In the past years, the team has focused on developing the platform and finding funding. Blomberg believes that now is the right time for a service like Documented.zone to bloom. “We want to turn the traditional mindset upside down and help companies see their content as valuable assets instead of internal costs. We can see that in many places the organisational culture is really taking steps to this direction.” At the moment, Documented.zone exists in English, Finnish and Spanish. Blomberg points out that the service isn’t targeted at any particular region or industry, but so far, the manufacturing sector has been the most active client in both selling and buying. Documented.zone also blurs the line between customers and solution providers. “The roles vary case by case, as sometimes you might be buying and sometimes selling,” Blomberg says. “In essence, the service is like a shopping mall where you can do both at the same time.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vitalsignum-connects-your-phone-with-your-heart/,VitalSignum connects your phone with your heart,"Born from a personal need, the Finnish Beat2Phone electrocardiogram (ECG) device and app has brought heart monitoring to the next level.  Monitoring heart rhythm via ECG tests is nothing new – most of us probably recognise the image of a beeping heart curve on a hospital monitor if not from our own experience, then at least from a film. However, checking a person’s electrical heart activity on their phone while standing next to them in their office is another story. ’s story, in fact. It all started with   research team leader and enthusiastic cyclist  , who experienced potential signs of overtraining one day and wanted to check his heart condition. He soon realised that the options for home monitoring were very slim. “The available alternatives were to either register the heart activity for a short time or do the monitoring in the hospital, which is problematic as the cardiac symptoms don’t necessarily occur during an appointment,” says VitalSignum CEO  . “Varpula came up with an easy-to-use device that was not yet available on the market.” The product immediately raised interest around the world and, in 2015, the project left VTT and VitalSignum was founded. Two years later, the company opened its online shop. The   device delivers realistic and continuous information about cardiac activity recorded while, for example, exercising, resting or spending a hectic day at work. Instead of using handheld sensors, the device does not interrupt other activities as it is strapped around the chest monitoring the heart 2 000 times per second. RDI manager Risto Soila (left) and CEO Veli-Heikki Saari see great possibilities for remote monitoring in the sector for preventive healthcare. The data is then transferred via Bluetooth to a phone app where the heart wave can be watched in real time or archived for later analysing. “Even with just a little bit of knowledge of ECG, the app makes it is easy to draw a lot of conclusions,” says Saari. “Everybody’s heart is slightly different, which makes it important to regularly check the cardiac condition and it is particularly interesting to see how it changes during exercise.” Athletes and coaches in particular buy the product as it allows them to maximise their condition and prevent possibly fatal cardiac problems. Monitoring heart rate variability can give indications of how well the body recovers from intense workouts, which is crucial in order to hit top condition and avoid overtraining. The product currently available is only the first version and VitalSignum aims to launch an upgraded device primarily intended for hospital use – but first it has to be medically approved. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the preventive care of strokes and thus potentially reduce both the pain and the costs caused by them. “Researchers believe that over half of strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation,” says Saari. “If the doctor can find the arrhythmia beforehand, it is possible to start preventive care and prevent strokes from occurring.” Therefore, the company now seeks medical approval for the upgraded Beat2Phone device and its intended purpose of high-quality ECG monitoring that is accurate enough to detect arrhythmias. The plan is to get the updated product on the market next year. By then the collected data will also be connected to a cloud from where doctors can easily access it and get valuable information for the diagnosing and treatment of the patient. Winning medical approval is a crucial step in commercialising the product and expanding the sales within and beyond the Finnish borders. The application areas are many and, in the future, the Beat2Phone device could also be used for home care in order to detect possible danger situations more quickly among elderly people. VitalSignum strives to become a leading provider of mobile solutions for monitoring healthcare and is currently mapping the international markets. “Our device has raised much interest in the medicine industry abroad, and both national and international universities are keen to use the device for research purposes,” says Saari. “I believe that these types of remote screenings will increase in Finland and all around the world.” The app allows marking of specific sections of the heart curve when feeling arrhythmias and even record voice comments to facilitate later analyses of the information."

Founded last year by a graphic novelist, a non-fiction writer, a film composer and a short-film enthusiast turned startup coach, the Ostrobothnia, Finland-based game studio is a big believer in the appeal and power of storytelling and unorthodox visual elements. “We create narrative experiences, to put it shortly,” retorts  , a co-founder and chief executive of Platonic Partnership. “We approach game development as if we were making a film or animation. Our primary focus is on the story, and we create the functionalities and other game-like elements around it.” The end results fall into the genre of visual novels – but only barely, according to Loukiainen. “We ended up going with the genre because it tells that the primary focus is not on game-like elements but rather on the story. But even that isn’t a perfect fit for us. We’re always trying to disrupt and introduce new elements,” he explains. “We don’t want to be confined too much by any genre.” Platonic Partnership brings games and animation together in a way that has not been seen before, says Jussi Loukiainen, a founder and chief executive of the three-person game studio. Platonic Partnership also demonstrated its preparedness to address sensitive social issues with its bold, critically acclaimed debut,  , a story-driven adventure game that delivers a grim portrayal of substance abuse through the eyes of its eponymous young heroine. The game garnered rave reviews – full of offbeat adjectives such as bleak, gloomy and stark – and resulted in its creator being selected as the Finnish Game Developer of the Year 2017. Loukiainen interprets the nomination as evidence that the game industry is maturing and shifting its attention away from mechanics towards content. “ is a game that doesn’t necessarily offer too many new features in terms of actual gameplay, but its innovativeness is related to how it deals with the story and introduces a new theme and approach to a sensitive subject,” he tells. “We’ll introduce new technical solutions with our other projects.” Platonic Partnership is determined to push the envelope even further with its sophomore game,  . Loukiainen reveals the game has been described in-house as a storytelling game – a genre that does not actually exist – and will employ humour as a stylistic device to create a contrast to the gloom and melancholy of  . Also, it will deal with serious topical issues such as racism, hate speech and social media but in a manner that is not overpowering, he assures. “It’ll be bit like a Pixar film: all kinds of audiences will be able to enjoy it,” summarises Loukiainen. and  are alike also in that neither requires players to pour hours and hours into it. “It’s game-specific, but one of the major defining factors is that we want to offer games to people who’d like to play games with profound themes but don’t have the time. It’s a challenge to deliver meaningful gaming experiences that are not only about mechanical gameplay but also storytelling in 10 minutes,” he says. “But that’s what makes this so interesting.” The games are therefore a means to both appeal to a distinct new audience and reach out to a demographic of gamers who otherwise might not be inclined to contemplate issues such as substance abuse. Loukiainen believes storytelling, on the whole, is poised to make a resurgence in the game industry. “The game industry is cyclical just like any other industry. Storytelling has been slightly overlooked in recent years, but now it’s starting to re-emerge. Many independent firms are focused on stories, also here in Finland. There’s about to be a storytelling renaissance,” he predicts. With trends such as e-sports and gamification simultaneously making games increasingly popular and widely accepted as both entertainment and, for example, educational tools, the future seems bright for a game developer with a knack for creating compelling narratives and the courage to tackle sensitive social topics. “As a small and agile firm, we’re able to support the expertise of our graphic designer and allow him to use the same storytelling techniques he does in his graphic novels and introduce them seamlessly to games. That’s unprecedented in the market,” tells Loukiainen. “We strive to innovate in terms of both storytelling and mechanics. We combine traditional games and animation in a way that has not been seen before,” he adds. “That’s our thing.” Platonic Partnership’s critically acclaimed debut, Lydia, is a grim portrayal of substance abuse through the eyes of a young girl."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/halla-halla-turns-plastic-trash-into-bold-beachwear/,Halla Halla turns plastic trash into bold beachwear,"Finland’s first sustainable swimwear brand was born out of two friends’ quest to find bikinis that both looked and felt good.  When   and   decided to start their own swimwear company in 2016, not everyone was convinced. The swimsuits have been applauded for both looking good and being comfortable. “People thought we were crazy,” Valkonen recalls. “Summer in Finland is short and trying to make swimwear was seen as a big risk.” The design duo, however, firmly believed in their own vision, which was to make fun swimwear suitable for active beach life and sports. They even had the right material in mind. “Whilst travelling and surfing in Asia, we really came to think about the huge amount of plastic waste in the ocean and wanted to do something about it.” After some thinking, the women came across a fabric made of recycled maritime plastic waste such as plastic bags, fishing nets and empty drinking bottles. The plastic is collected by volunteers around the world and then turned into eye-popping nylon materials in Italy. Chalvet and Valkonen design all the pieces themselves, and the swimsuits are manufactured in Bali, Indonesia. Despite the initial scepticism, it soon became clear that Chalvet and Valkonen had developed a winning formula.  In just two years their swimwear brand, titled  , has become wildly popular and turned two surfer girls into full-time entrepreneurs. Halla Halla specialises in playful colours and bold cuts. “It has all happened very quickly. We were lucky in that we immediately got some media attention, but we did also work around the clock,” Chalvet says. Sustainability is an important aspect of Halla Halla swimwear but not the sole reason for its success. Playful colours and bold cuts have made the bikinis and one-pieces a hit especially among the younger Instagram generation. “It was clear to us from the start that we wanted to combine eco-friendliness and fashion in our swimsuits.  These were two things we didn’t want to compromise on.” Many customers also thank the designers for finally creating a swimsuit that both looks good and is comfortable to wear. The women behind Halla Halla know the importance of practical beachwear all too well. “As surfers we pretty much used to wear bikinis all day. However, it was really difficult to find anything that suited our taste,” Valkonen explains. Before becoming business partners, Valkonen and Chalvet were good friends. The couple met whilst studying clothing design at Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences and soon started discussing starting a company together. The name “Halla Halla” refers to the Finnish word for “frost” but also celebrates the women’s friendship, merging the initials of both of their first names. So far Halla Halla swimwear has only been available via the online shop, and each collection has sold out. The next chapter will be developing international audiences and expanding the product family. The women welcome the challenge: “We have had the chance to see the world and our sources for inspiration are endless.” Chalvet and Valkonen design all the pieces themselves."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/post-like-a-pro-with-kojo/,Post like a pro with Kojo,"KojoApp, a Rovaniemi-based app developer, is seeking to raise the bar for social media content published by sports clubs of all kinds and sizes. A strong social media presence has become pretty much a necessity for sports clubs of all sizes. Even youth and lower-tier clubs are expected to utilise social media to drive registrations, attract sponsors, promote fan engagement, and build trust with the mothers and fathers of aspiring sportsmen and sportswomen. Creating content that is both informative and visually appealing can be difficult, painstaking and, occasionally, even unrewarding – especially if you happen to also volunteer as the equipment manager of a youth ice hockey team or be in charge of creating content for several semi-professional teams. “It can take an hour to create a couple of photos, but it only takes seconds for people to breeze through them on Instagram,” tells  , the founder and chief executive of  . Easy social media posts are now far less than a handful. He speaks from experience, having previously been responsible for making social media updates for a number of ice hockey teams in Finland. “I was basically making them by hand. I designed templates with a photo editor for various situations and then posted the updates on social media. I simply didn’t have the time to hand-make those for several teams.” Such was the impetus for establishing KojoApp, a Rovaniemi-based app developer dedicated to making it easier for sports clubs of all sizes to create professional-like content for social media. The Kojo app is already used actively by roughly 100 sports clubs in Finland and Sweden, despite it having been launched last December. “Our boxing templates have also been used in India,” tells Kojo. “We’re pleased that the users we’ve gotten have all been very satisfied. The features that are currently available are working well. We’re still just starting out, however, and we’ll introduce new features to improve the app further,” he says. The app presently offers a variety of hand-picked templates that can be used to provide fans, parents and sponsors with match-day previews, player bios, score updates and other topical news around the club. An enhanced version with premium features is currently under development, according to Kojo. “Our pricing system will be similar to those of Netflix and Spotify: an affordable monthly subscription fee that will vary depending on your needs. We focus on the mass, and we understand that you can’t charge 500 euros from small clubs. We also stand out because our app is so user-friendly that no manual is needed. You don’t have know how to use or have experience with a complex software such as Photoshop,” he states. “We also stand out because our app is so user-friendly that no manual is needed,” says CEO Mikael Kojo. The market potential is undeniable: Finland alone has  . In the UK, the number of clubs is  . “That’s the ballpark,” says Kojo. “Our growth prospects are fairly good here, but our goal is to become the standard for sports graphics at some point, to become the primary option for sports clubs thinking about starting posting on social media. And for larger clubs, our app can be a supplementary tool.” Although many of the existing clubs are already present on social media one way or the other, there are bound to be clubs that would welcome a more cost and time-efficient tool for engaging with their fan base and clubs that have simply yet to have the time to establish a social media presence. “Even though there has been a lot of chatter about digitalisation for years, it’s still basically in its infancy when it comes to sports clubs. Also, new clubs are being founded all the time. Everyone has to start somewhere,” reminds Kojo. He believes the app will also raise the bar for social media content published by sports clubs. If your local recreational football team with a 45-year-old goalkeeper-manager is able to create content that is easy on the eye, surely its professional counterparts have no excuses for making unexciting, slapdash posts."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tellabout-gathers-memories-together/,TellAbout gathers memories together,"Photos and videos are a great way to keep memories alive, but posting personal shots on social media can feel dodgy. Finnish company Path 4More created a service for sharing them privately. Back in 2011,   CEO and co-founder   was walking in a graveyard, looking at the gravestones. To use TellAbout, you don’t need to download an app – it’s all web-based. “I thought it’s a little sad if that’s the only thing that is left of the person,” he recalls. Around that time, Partanen’s first child was a toddler, and Partanen realised that watching the kid grow would be like an endless stream of memories he wanted to capture. What if the recollections could be stored and enriched? Of course, people have been saving and sharing photos and videos on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook for years already. However, public platforms with their changing terms and conditions might not suit those who seek extra privacy and security for their images – particularly when they portray small children. “I thought about a service that would provide a way of putting the best shots and videos in one place, have room for captions and stories, be easy to share with others and so private that Facebook or Google wouldn’t be able to get hold of the images.” That was, and is, the idea of  . TellAbout enables storing and sharing photos and videos online, and creating albums for things like parties and events. For example, newlyweds can ask guests to add their shots from the wedding and put together an album for their memorable day, and then share it with others. For CEO Ristomatti Partanen, privacy is a major concern, and he knows he’s not the only one. In essence, TellAbout combines the best of traditional and contemporary ways of storing photos. In terms of privacy, it’s like a physical photo album kept on a bookshelf at home; its owner can choose whom to show it to. However, it’s also digital, meaning that loved ones near and far can contribute to and enjoy the content, and it can also include videos. “It’s like a modern alternative to a traditional photo album, not fully replacing but complementing it,” Partanen explains. “Sharing memories is much easier with TellAbout, because copying and distributing a physical album would be a lot of work and expensive.” The content is abundant, as these days people tend to snap photos on a daily basis. Most of the photos are stored in a memory card, a hard drive or a cloud service. If the hard drive breaks or, in worst cases, something happens to the person with the password, the photos can be lost forever. TellAbout, in turn, acts like a collective memory. The first version of TellAbout was published in 2013 by the three-strong Path 4More founding team. Now, the service is available in English, Finnish and Italian, with the biggest markets being in Italy, the US and Finland. In addition to consumers, TellAbout is targeted at companies, especially event organisers and tourism services. This way, the organisers can store and share photos and videos taken from a tour or an event or allow participants to share their own. To boost internationalisation, the plan is now to find partners around the globe, particularly in the B2B2C market. The basic service is free, but additional volume and features come with paid, premium accounts. Partanen says that wedding albums are a particularly big market, often leading to honeymoon albums and, just a little later, family photo collections. When it comes to family, Partanen, himself a father of two, is careful about what he shares on Facebook. No pictures of his children, and no names, either. “I know I’m not the only one who’s wary of privacy issues,” he notes. “With TellAbout, you have the control over who has access to the photos, and the copyrights will never be taken away from the user.”"

It occupies around 35 per cent of the plastic shopping bag market in Finland. Elsewhere,   has developed the application   to help Finnish chain restaurants track their food waste. By utilising analysed data in the application, restaurants can reduce food waste significantly through careful planning. “The best way to deal with food waste is to prevent it, as this is the only way to enable restaurants to make long-term profit,” says  , business manager for material efficiency and environmental services from Lassila & Tikanoja. “For example, the   restaurant chain saved over 100 tonnes of food waste last year by using our application.” The Finnish forest industry has been among the most active players in implementing the circular economy. According to  , the forest industry is based on circulation.

Sure, she won’t touch the clouds – but she’ll grow up to create her own world of wonders.  sees fairytales in children’s eyes. Pomenia board games and books bring families together. “Children’s eyes look like they’re shining,” she explains, “like they’re full of imagination without any of the limitations adults have grown aware of. We should all find a way to get closer to that feeling.” Grahn remembers well how it felt to know no boundaries. When she was eight, she was confident that she would learn to fly if only she practised hard enough. All the hours spent trying weren’t wasted, although she never succeeded in her attempts. “I had so much fun,” she recalls laughingly. “In a child’s imagination, everything is possible.” However, these days children are playing less and less, especially outdoors. For years, experts around the world have been warning that the physical, social and mental benefits of playing will be missed out on, if kids stay indoors spending time with gadgets and screens. To Grahn, this sounds like a global tragedy. Her way of fighting back is  , a world full of fairytales, magic, imagination and shining eyes. Grahn first introduced her fairytale world to the public through Tinttu.com, a children’s fashion collection, and kept the stories of Pomenia to herself for over twenty years. She shared the tales of the fairy dreamland with her six children as wonderful bedtime stories, teaching them important lessons and creating magical games. Petronella Grahn, the creator of Pomenia, wishes to see Pomenia help kids be kids. Tinttu.com was born out of Grahn’s urge to create colourful and imaginative clothes for her own kids, designed to bring a bit of fairytale to everyday life. “I can’t stand kids’ rooms that look like they’re for tiny grown-ups, and the same applies to clothes,” she says. “A child is far too beautiful to be an adult!” Whilst running the shop, the stories kept on growing. In the land of Pomenia, a little boy is helping fairies prevent a wizard from stealing all the laughter and joy in the world. The core message revolves around the courage to be true to oneself and follow what feels right, and the characters of the imaginary universe are present in Tinttu.com’s collections. A few years ago, Grahn happened to run into an investor, who agreed that Pomenia should be shared with everyone. Since then, she hasn’t seen much daylight: she first learnt how to use digital graphic design tools and then created digital versions of her paintings. Two years were needed for Petronella to write down all the stories of Pomenia and bring all her characters to life. Currently, Tinttu.com is taking a break, so that Grahn can fully focus on Pomenia. Later this year, the story will start travelling around the world in the form of books, a mobile app and a board game. On top of this, there are clothes, curtains and accessories that reflect on the colours familiar from the magical world. “There is so much nonsense in mobile apps for children,” Grahn says. “My aim was to create a game that’s not so much about teaching cognitive skills as it is about encouraging kids to explore the world of fairytales, adventures and imagination.” Initially, the stories will be available in Finnish and English, but German and Spanish will follow suit as soon as possible. Grahn’s idea is to find partners and licensees that share Pomenia’s values and ambitions. With over two decades of experience as a storyteller, artist, entrepreneur and mother of six, she’s confident there are other parents who are just as frustrated with what’s being marketed for children in this day and age. She points out that children have no idea there are different colours for boys and girls – until someone tells them so. “Children should be seen as children, not as targets for marketing. Let them be little.” However, she’s not battling gender roles. Grahn’s goal is to bring people of all ages closer to their true self through fairytales and offer a safe escape from everyday life for those who need it. “The best thing about imagination is that it makes you forget who and how old you are and what your role in this world is,” she says. “A good fairytale not only teaches kids to read and write, but it also takes them on an adventure that gives a lesson about empathy and ethics. I can’t imagine what could be more important than that.” Later this year, the story will start travelling around the world in the form of books, a mobile app and a board game."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/better-coffee-with-good-life/,Better coffee with Good Life,"“We take care of the geeky stuff so that our customers have it easier,” says Samuli Ronkanen, the owner and master roaster of Good Life Coffee Roasters. Finns have long been known for their fondness for coffee.   (ICO) indicate that the nation continues to consume more coffee per capita than any other in the world – a whopping 12 kilos, or approximately 1 000 cups, a year. The focus, however, has traditionally been on quantity rather and quality and the relationship between the consumer and the product utilitarian rather than romantic. decided a couple of years ago it was time to do something to change that. He opened   in Kallio, Helsinki, in 2012, determined put coffee first by focusing on high-quality ingredients and carefully selected brewing methods. Finns consume approximately 1 000 cups of coffee annually per capita. “The thing for me from the very get-go was that coffee had to be the priority. We did have cafés at the time, but coffee was seldom the main thing. It was rather a necessary evil – something you had to make because everyone else was making it, something that was made from the same ingredients and in the same slightly offhand way wherever you went,” he tells. Pipinen was confident he could do better. He had dabbled in coffee at home in his free time and refined his skills and knowhow working at  , an importer of espresso coffee and machines in Lauttasaari, Helsinki, and  , a coffee roastery in Punavuori, Helsinki. “I wanted to change people’s perceptions of coffee,” he says. Good Life Coffee embarked on its mission using coffee beans from a variety of independent roasteries and quickly built a reputation in the fledgling third-wave coffee scene in Helsinki and Finland, partly due to its founder’s past and concurrent successes in barista competitions. It was on a visit to London for the 2010 World AeroPress Championship that Pipinen met  , a coffee enthusiast who would later become the owner and master roaster of Good Life Coffee Roasters. “Samuli was there competing as an amateur. Seeing a Finn I didn’t know on the participant list was a surprise, because I thought I knew everyone,” says Pipinen. “We got to know each other there and found ourselves going to the same coffee events also in Finland.” Ronkanen reveals he would soon start to consider turning one of his main interests – coffee or photography – into a career after years in the information technology sector. “A café wasn’t my thing and, in a certain sense, neither was roasting,” he tells. “But what was interesting is that there was no premium small roastery in Finland that refused to make compromises, only used the best green coffee available and packaged its products as well as possible.” The company supplies coffee to customers in Europe, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. “That was the idea: we wanted to be the place that’s also known internationally,” he adds. Good Life Coffee Roasters was founded in 2014. Today, it supplies coffee not only to Good Life Coffee but also to several other cafés in Finland and Europe, as well as to more distant countries such as Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Also Pipinen has drawn closer to his objective – of redefining the relationship between a nation and a beverage. Cafés, he gauges, are frequented by more and more people even though they continue to face stiff competition from the countless of coffee machines in homes and workplaces across Finland. “People nowadays are going to cafés more to eat, have breakfast and, especially, look for high-quality coffee,” he says. More work remains to be done, however. Ronkanen tells that some seem to still be daunted by the idea of trying a cup of the so-called third-wave coffee, fearing that it is somehow too fancy or difficult for them. “Our underlying idea is that good coffee isn’t that difficult. You buy better ingredients and use clean equipment and good water. Making good coffee, or better coffee, isn’t difficult. Of course we use all sorts of technical equipment at the roastery and put a lot of effort into making sure the coffee tastes good at the café, but we take care of all that geeky stuff so that customers have it easier,” he says. Pipinen reveals that the name Good Life Coffee is a homage to Good Life Cafe, a cafe that served as a meeting place and springboard for underground rappers in Los Angeles in the 1990s. The name also captures his approach to being a business owner and service provider. “We at the café want to do our part to make sure that life’s good, that our employees like working here and that our customers enjoy the coffee and service. It’s really an all-embracing slogan for our operations and life in general,” explains Pipinen. No Caption"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tulopos-serves-convenience-to-the-table/,Tulopos serves convenience to the table,"When it comes to point of sale systems, the restaurant industry is underserved. Finnish company Tulopos promises nothing less than to solve all problems with a custom-made solution. A busy evening at a fine-dining restaurant, with large groups of friends and acquaintances scattered around the tables. A theatre play is starting nearby, and suddenly 30 people want to sort out their bill to rush to the show. What happens? “The existing systems are very inflexible, so dividing the bill between the correct seats and products can take forever, not to mention the effect on the overall efficiency of the restaurant,” says  , co-founder of  . “As there is not enough point of sale system equipment and there are probably temporary waiters at work on a busy night, the extra hassle might mean these people risk being late for the show.” This, according to Ollila, stems from the fact that point of sales (POS) systems aren’t designed with restaurants in mind. Many of them are mainly targeted at retail. “There’s a lot more money in retail, whereas restaurants with high labour costs don’t have attractive amounts of coin,” Ollila explains. “Hence, restaurants adapt to the POS system, not the other way around.” However, if Ollila has a say in the matter, the game is set to change radically. We aim to serve our clients as well as they serve theirs. Tulopos, a POS and inventory management system for restaurants, is the creation of Ollila and his friend  , both seasoned professionals in the industry. Their goal was to custom-make a tool for restaurant staff that saves time and energy and doesn’t get on anyone’s nerves – including those of the client. The system is as intuitive as possible, including all products, areas, tables and individual seats in a restaurant. New items can be easily added to the database, and thus the bill is always correct, even if the waiter changes mid-service. Splitting the bill or dividing a portion between several people can be done simply by clicking on the screen. Tulopos also smoothens internal communications within the restaurant. The kitchen is always on the ball, as the waiting staff don’t need to rely solely on their memory or scribbled notes regarding allergies and special requests. “Tulopos is also an internal resource planning system,” Ollila tells. “Normally, a big chunk of a waiter’s day goes into just sorting things out, but Tulopos is so easy to use that it’s much more difficult to mess up than just do things right at once.” On top of simplicity, which naturally leads to more efficient use of time, Tulopos saves restaurant owners’ money by offering the software without compulsory hardware purchases. Juhani Ollila has seen both clients and waiters get frustrated with inflexible POS systems. “Most POS systems include the device, making them costly,” Ollila tells. “Tulopos, in turn, is a local web application, so it can be used on any device that can run Google Chrome.” One of the things Ollila is most excited about is how Tulopos can also be used for data collection and analysis. This way, small restaurants can benefit from a level of industry knowledge they wouldn’t be able to achieve on their own. “By aggregating the data, we can review how the sales of, for example, a certain type of lager in a particular region or city have developed,” Ollila says. “This can be worth a lot of money for restaurant owners, distributors and wholesalers, because it helps plan supply based on credible predictions.” With all these tools at its disposal, Tulopos is widening its reach. As it has already conquered several Finnish cities, the next step will be taken in Copenhagen, where the structure of the industry is similar to that in Helsinki. From there, the duo will be seeking for partners elsewhere in Europe and beyond. Another thing that differentiates Tulopos from other system providers is its customer service. Ollila says that they’ve managed to build a reputation of excellence by picking up the phone during the hours when restaurants are open, not switching off phones when the clock hits 6pm. “The restaurant industry is a human-centric business, and the staff want guests to feel good. We aim to serve our clients as well as they serve theirs.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/disior-augments-healthcare-with-algorithms/,Disior augments healthcare with algorithms,"This Finnish company has developed its software based on technical expertise from Nokia to support doctors in their decision-making. New technologies are seemingly entering all areas of life, and yet a visit to the doctor’s is still in many ways very similar to what it has always been. But a new image analytics tool by the Finnish firm   may soon become a new element in the mix. The company’s software analyses medical images such as CT and MRI scans, and creates mathematical models of bones and soft tissues that can then be analysed for shapes, sizes, angles, volumes and distances. This information is critical for doctors in determining a diagnosis and treatment, and especially useful when preparing, for example, for an orthopaedic surgery. Take a patient with a fractured eye socket. Disior’s tool helps determine the changes in the volume and shape of the socket – things a doctor needs to know in order to decide what kind of care is needed and whether or not to operate. “Currently this type of analysis is largely manual, which means that decisions about treatment can be highly subjective,” says  , CEO of Disior. “Our software provides data that is accurate, objective and comparable.” The company raised 600 000 euros in seed funding in March. Perhaps surprisingly, the expertise behind the algorithms at the core of Disior’s software was originally developed in a very different context: similar algorithms were used in Nokia’s 3D simulation systems to optimise mobile phone mechanics. When Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business and eventually closed it in 2016, former employees Henell and   had to consider their next move. The answer was healthcare. “I originally dreamt of becoming a doctor, and that lead us to explore if there was a way to bring our technical knowhow to the field of medicine,” Henell says. As it turned out, they were able to reprogramme the simulation system to analyse human tissue instead of mobile phone structure. Entering an entirely new industry, the company knew it needed to build a strong collaboration with doctors, and Henell says that listening to input from healthcare professionals was crucial in making sure that the product matched their needs. Moreover, understanding the healthcare business was also a challenge initially. But support from experts in the field has helped the company navigate the industry, including its complex business models, need to produce medical research and strict regulations concerning medical products. For instance, Disior’s software will be granted the European CE marking this autumn, certifying its conformity with European regulations. “When I go to see the doctor, I want to meet a person, not a machine,” says CEO Anna-Maria Henell. Right now, the firm is focused on the Nordic countries but plans to expand to Central European markets soon. And it already has its eyes set on the US, the biggest healthcare market in the world, where there has been initial interest in the software and where the company already has started collaborations with a few hospitals in Boston. Henell is keen to emphasise that Disior’s vision is to give support to healthcare professionals and that the technology in no way undermines their traditional role: “With our system the doctor is still entirely in control of making the diagnosis and deciding about treatment. But our software will give them reliable and high-quality data to make those decisions.” Ultimately, the doctor–patient relationship is at the heart of healthcare and should never be compromised by technology: “When I go to see the doctor, I want to meet a person, not a machine,” Henell says. “But it’s so gratifying to know that people may get better treatment thanks to our product.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/teqmine-helps-firms-unleash-innovative-potential/,Teqmine helps firms unleash innovative potential,"This Finnish software-as-a-service provider is dedicated to helping people whose success depends on their ability to make the right decisions about technology. There seems to be no shortage of talk today about how organisations need to foster and harness the innovative potential of each and every employee. COO Phesto Mwakyusa (left) and CEO Hannes Toivanen (right) of Teqmine at Vivatech in Paris. Too many of the employees who come up with an idea with commercial promise are still faced with patent procedures too toilsome that they are discouraged from developing their idea further, views  , a co-founder and chief executive of  . “Your ability to do a patent search has up until now been dependent on you having access to an expert such as a patent engineer,” he explains. Teqmine is of the opinion that scoping the patent landscape does not have to be that difficult. The Helsinki-based software-as-a-service provider has developed an automated artificial intelligence-assisted tool that allows users to enter a text description of their idea and compares it to over 16 million full-text patents to help to determine its novelty and identify ways to improve it further. “Our contention is that we’re the world’s only company that has created an artificial intelligence system trained with full-length patents, which can be anything from two to 800 pages long,” tells Toivanen. “Its accuracy is better than any of the solutions developed – or at least commercialised – by others.” He highlights that the patent similarity tool has been designed to be accessible from anywhere and be as user-friendly as possible. “We’ve designed it primarily for people who either have never made a single patent search or find making them unpleasant,” he elaborates. “We’re essentially making them smarter.” Teqmine has provided services to businesses, public agencies and research institutions including the  ,   and the   (PRH) – the first patent office in the world to utilise artificial intelligence to evaluate patent applications. “Our clients are organisations that strive to develop new technologies,” summarises Toivanen. “Our services are or have been used also by a half-a-dozen Fortune 100 companies.” The use cases, he says, range from inventors eager to determine if their idea has already been patented and product development managers eager to improve their products further, to investors interested in appraising the value of a particular innovation. “People are also wondering how to communicate the value of their invention to others and if there are any other people working on the same idea or in the same area,” adds Toivanen. Our services are or have been used also by a half-a-dozen Fortune 100 companies. Data security is naturally an integral aspect of the service, particularly for corporate clients, he acknowledges. Teqmine stores all images and descriptions and conducts all patent searches and analyses on its private servers in order to provide a level of data protection comparable to that in online banking. “Privacy protection is a major reason for our ability to sell to corporate clients,” he explains. Toivanen points out that the patent similarity tool presents a number of benefits to organisations by effectively digitising their innovation process: it cultivates organisational creativity by encouraging staff members to innovate and creates time and resource savings by streamlining the innovation process. “It empowers people to be more inventive and hopefully helps to promote the use of technology to solve different problems,” he states. “Another benefit,” he adds, “is that it enhances organisations’ understanding of their competitive position, opportunities and risks in real time. Yet another one is that it helps people to understand investor information and understand the value of companies by incorporating technology into stock market information.” The tool can also assist in the search for business and research partners by identifying organisations developing similar or related technologies. Hannes Toivanen, the CEO of Teqmine, delivered his pitch at PulPaper18 in Helsinki. Teqmine has also begun developing a supplementary system that utilises the wealth of patent data to predict technological trends and the future inventions of technology leaders such as Apple and  . “It should be available less than a year from now,” says Toivanen. “If we get it to work properly, it’ll be quite a groundbreaking system. The current tool is working so well that our expectations are high. I have no reason to doubt our ability to match the accuracy of traditional predictive solutions used, for example, to predict diabetes in patients.” Toivanen acknowledges that the company has been able to grow and develop its service offering rapidly particularly because it is located in Finland. “Finland has adopted a very progressive approach to using artificial intelligence and thereby given us a substantial competitive edge. We have an awful lot of demanding, globally well-known technology firms here, which have helped us by being demanding clients,” he explains."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-feedback-tools/,Five for Friday: Feedback tools,"What’s the word on giving feedback? Listen to these Finns. Finnish people are known for being straight-shooting. There is no need to present your opinions daintily on a bed of cotton wool here. Hence, it’s no surprise that they have pioneered a number of effective feedback platforms. This AI-based customer experience analytics software is a tool that can process feedback in 60 languages. “Lumoa brings together multiple customer feedback sources and combines them utilising NLP [natural language processing] and AI to give the best and most comprehensive direct guidance to the business users on how to improve single points of customer journey,”    , partner at Icebreaker.vc, which led a 650 000-euro funding round into Lumoa earlier this year.

This company improves employee productivity and the work environment with its science-based Quality of Work Life (QWL) method. This consists of 15 strategically selected questions for employees designed to help uncover what areas of the business need improvement. “We have companies that have used the Quality of Work Life, or QWL, method and within a year have improved their profitability by 25 per cent due to increased engagement,”  , CEO and co-founder of VibeCatch,   to us. Giving feedback needs to be simple and immediate, according to this company, which set up an interface that can be prominently positioned for customer opinion. “Consumers press one of the four buttons on the HappyOrNot terminals,” the company’s    . “We collect all the data and provide a reporting service for our clients by email. We get so much feedback from consumers that we can create statistics that companies have never received before.” Touting itself as the “only customer feedback software with built-in marketing and sales tools”, this company also sees itself as the first customer feedback tool to enable companies to use a single dashboard to manage and collect data from all feedback channels. “This is a comprehensive feedback tool; you cannot find it on the same scale anywhere else,” CEO . “You might be able to buy something like this for a lot of money, but there is no other scalable, cloud-based solution which is also targeted at smaller companies.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/merivaara-lights-way-to-cleaner-operating-theatres/,Merivaara lights way to cleaner operating theatres,"Finnish hospital equipment maker Merivaara has gone through many changes in its 110-year history. But the company’s current focus on using design and digital tools to improve operating theatres could be its most transformative yet.  , CEO of  , has some distinct furniture in his office: metallic, red leather clad barber chairs from the 1920s which remind him of the company’s long history. Founded back in 1901 as a steel furniture maker, Merivaara has since grown into a truly international operation. “We have subsidiaries in Norway and Sweden and resellers in 120 countries,” Aherto states. “We have more and more people abroad: in Brazil, Florida, Nairobi, Russia and the UK. We want to be where our customers are.” Merivaara’s new Q-Flow light has received two design awards for its innovative shape. At the heart of this expansion is constant product development. Merivaara hasn’t been afraid to experiment with minimalistic, functional designs for both industrial and private use, and this approach is embodied in its new ‘Q-Flow’ operating theatre light. Not only is Q-Flow highly colour accurate, so surgeons can see exact tones as they operate, but it also automatically eliminates shadows as the surgeon moves. And yet what sets the Q-Flow apart from rivals is its unusual doughnut-like shape. “This is where Q-Flow is more advanced than any other light in the world,” Aherto explains. “The standard, large UFO-like operating theatre lights create a vacuum on the top and bacteria is spread around the room uncontrollably.” By contrast the spaces left between the concentric rings in the Q-Flow design allow air to flow through, so it can be extracted by the theatre’s air filtration system and keep bacteria out of the operating area. This innovation has not been lost on design enthusiasts. Since Q-Flow’s launch in early 2017 the light has been awarded the   in Finland and an international  . But Q-Flow is not just a clever light, it is a ‘smart light’ connecting with Merivaara’s first software product: an integrated operating theatre management system called OpenOR. Launched in 2012, OpenOR can manage patient lists, retrieve endoscopic and x-ray images, control air conditioning, operating theatre beds and lights and even stream music and real-time video to the hospital auditorium. Q-Flow is highly colour accurate, meaning that surgeons can see exact tones as they operate. This combination of hardware and software innovation is Merivaara’s key differentiator in a market which is highly competitive. The company exports around 85 per cent of its products, half of which is basic hospital furniture and half specialised operating theatre products. Aherto says creating visibility for a medium-sized company (Merivaara has 120 staff) with a modest marketing budget is not easy, particularly when up against big global players. This is where field work and focus on product development comes into play. “Finland has a great reputation for product development globally,” he says. “Especially as we increasingly move into software products, there’s a lot of expertise and talented people here.” Q-Flow is part of Merivaara’s latest R&D venture, Inoroom. This is a cutting-edge operating theatre developed to improve efficiency and safety made a collaboration with Finnish indoor-air specialist   and clean room maker  . Inoroom covers OpenOR, operating theatre equipment, air control, hermetically sealed modular walls and a service agreement. So far Inoroom has only been launched in Finland, but Aherto believes it represents the future of the company: “We are increasingly​ looking at the software, system and concept side of the business,” he says. “Our growth comes from projects where we work with partners to deliver large concepts. We are now building the base for success in the market for another 100 years.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/good-vibrations-help-conexbird-prevent-cargo-loss/,Good vibrations help Conexbird prevent cargo loss,"Cargo damage represents a 50-billion-dollar annual problem for the logistics industry. But Finnish startup Conexbird believes it has the answer.   roots go back to a single newspaper article in 2011. In it a logistics industry chief discussed Nokia’s layoffs in Finland declaring, “We do not have any use for former Nokia engineers”. Little did he know this would inspire  , a former Nokia employee, to prove him wrong. “There are plenty of cargo surveyor services where a consultant is invited to check whether bindings are correct, but our system is much faster,” explains Niko Polvinen. “Teuvo got so aggravated by the comment he started to look into how his skills could be used to revolutionise the logistics industry,” explains  , business development officer at Conexbird. “He noticed the industry was introducing x-ray machines, which cost millions of euros, even though the same results could be reached with vibration technology.” Conexbird was founded two years later and today its patented vibration-based technology can be used instead of x-rays to examine the structure of containers, condition of their cargo and binding quality. Together with artificial intelligence (AI) and a cloud platform, these form the backbone for the company’s trio of data-driven products which are designed to prevent cargo losses and make the logistics process faster and safer. It is something the industry has not seen before, says Polvinen: “At the moment our only competition is people manually doing similar jobs.” A simple way to understand how Conexbird’s vibration technology works is to take a wine glass straight from a washing machine. Tap it with a nail and if the sound has changed, the glass has been damaged in the wash. This same principle underpins Conexbird’s electronic hammer, which gently knocks on container walls. “We have sensors measuring how the sound vibrates,” Polvinen explains. “Then we let our AI collect the data and analyse, for example, whether the lashing has changed since the last knock.” Conexbird applies this technology, among others, to create ‘virtual seals’ for closed containers. Unlike physical seals on container doors, which are the industry norm, the virtual seal cannot be cheated. Even if a kilo of the cargo is removed (or added), the vibration changes and the cargo owner is alerted through a mobile app. The same mobile app can also be used to ensure a load is secured correctly. A user takes photos of the load through the app and AI analyses whether the straps are the right type, amount and tightness to get, for example, a 20-tonne ship part safely to its destination. “If a part falls in the sea or is damaged, a ship or other big construction site may wait six months for a new one,” Polvinen says. “65 per cent of all damages to cargo are somehow related to how it is loaded. We can eliminate this by ensuring the lashing is correct.” The company is able to analyse and compare patterns from millions of shipments, which would be impossible to do manually. Conexbird launched its first product in late 2016 for the forest industry and now targets all types of shippers, harbours and warehouses. The company also looks to partner up with logistics operators, such as Finnish  , which can integrate Conexbrid’s products in their own service packages. The next step for the company is international expansion. Currently Conexbird is discussing licensing options with two global logistics equipment manufacturers, which could open the gates to harbours worldwide. For Conexbird, its ultimate aim is a safer and more environmentally friendly logistics chain, particularly as the industry moves towards automated harbours and ships. “My guess is the change is going to be much faster than forecasted today,” Polvinen says. “Autonomous ships are already developed in Finland and Tesla has said their cars will be self-driving by 2020. Maritime traffic will not be far behind.” Such developments mean only one thing for Polvinen and Conexbird: “We want to be part of creating the logistics chain of the future.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/global-success-pipeline-lvi-turva/,Global success in the pipeline for LVIturva,"Finnish company LVIturva, specialised in pipe renovation of detached houses, has developed a trailblazing technique for plumbing that revolutionises the whole business. All Finnish humility aside – this northern nation is one of the best places in the world to develop new ideas. The number of pioneers and innovations across various industries underline such hype:  ,   and now LVIturva’s new solution for renovating plumbing in detached houses, are but some of the many examples of Finnish ingenuity. An open mind has been key for  , established in 2010 as a regular pipe company. Its unprejudiced and solution-oriented attitude has brought the company unprecedented success. “The bright idea here is that we have managed to bring the cured-in-place pipe method to be used in smaller scale projects, such as in single-family house renovations,” explains CEO  . Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) technology is a widely used trenchless rehabilitation method in large construction and renovation projects, where a surface made of polyester resin and saturated with epoxy resin is installed inside old drainage pipes. Hence, old pipes do not have to be dug out, and sewer renovation can be successfully carried out quickly and efficiently. “Before our solution, a plumbing renovation could only have been done by demolishing concrete from the entire width of the pipes and replacing them,” says Kilpeläinen. “I am really proud of what we are doing,” states CEO Kilpeläinen. From the customer’s perspective, the revolutionary technology converts weeks- or even months-long nerve-wracking projects into an exceedingly cost-efficient three-day effort. “Traditional plumbing companies wait in their office for customers to show up once something is seriously broken and needs to be fixed,” Kilpeläinen observes. “We have established a sales organisation with the intention of selling information and scanning the condition of the customer’s pipes in order to evaluate the need for renovation.” However, for a regular Joe, it can be borderline impossible to spot any flaws in their house pipes. LVIturva has thus reinvented the whole industry by making owners of detached houses realise they should act proactively, before any serious or irreversible damage is done. The fast growing company had 10 employees in 2012. Today, LVIturva’s workforce comprises over 200 personnel, while this year’s turnover is expected to reach 20 million euros. The company’s success story began in 2014. After visiting various expositions around Europe, the representatives of LVIturva realised that no one was incorporating CIPP solutions for detached houses, where the pipe diameters are considerably smaller. “It became clear that only straight pipes were being cured in place, but not bends nor branches, which detached houses tend to have plenty of,” Kilpeläinen explains. “We began to search for suitable partners to seek solutions with. Soon enough we had a functioning technique ready and the world wide open.” Aside from the domestic market, LVIturva is currently also operating in Sweden. Next in the pipeline are the Norwegian and German markets, which both also have similar renovation needs. “The atmosphere of thinking outside of the box, combined with the guaranteed high standard of quality with everything made in Finland are great assets for us,” Kilpeläinen reasons. “For instance, our idea would never have occurred in Germany, as there is still high demand for old-fashioned concrete demolishing methods.” History has shown that Finns from different backgrounds are used to pulling together, so that within the bounds of possibility are things that might have been considered only as pipe dreams elsewhere. “I am really proud of what we are doing,” Kilpeläinen concludes. According to the company, LVIturva is the first pipe company in Finland to specialise in and focus on such proactive renovations."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/triplewin-manages-to-change-with-digital-solution/,TripleWin manages to change with digital solution,"Finnish company TripleWin is using digital collaboration and gamification to shift change management from consultancy jargon to an engaging tool for organisational transformation. The speed of digitalisation can feel overwhelming. Industries face disruption, companies adopt new business models and their employees need to keep up with constant change. But while a workshop on a company’s digital transformation can ignite an enthusiastic spark for change, it is easily extinguished when we return to our desks, facing a full inbox and unfinished reports. This is why Helsinki-based company   believes the traditional ‘top-down’ model of organisational change does not work in the digital world. “If a small group makes a plan, presents it on a slideshow and then says, ‘let’s implement this’, others are not able to learn from it and commit to it,” explains company founder and CEO  . “People are more committed when they can come up with things to do themselves, instead of just being told what to do.” The company’s answer is ‘NOOA’, the first online platform for change management. The cloud-based platform taps into collaboration and gamification tools to help engage the whole organisation, wherever they are located, in the change process. How this works in practice is by first splitting a company’s strategic goal (such as creating a more customer-centric work culture) into challenges. Its employees can then use NOOA on the web or mobile to join these challenges, create practical actions, give and receive feedback and be rewarded for being active, while their managers get measurable data on their progress. TripleWin’s approach seems to be hitting the spot. Since NOOA was launched in August 2016, it has landed customers both in Finland and the US and received the Finnish Quality Association’s international  , beating over 350 competitors from 11 countries. People are more committed when they can come up with things to do themselves, instead of just being told what to do. But technology has not always been the focus for the company. TripleWin was founded in 2009 as a traditional management consultancy firm and started to develop NOOA four years ago once it saw customers needed new tools to keep up with the fast-pace of digitalisation. Now TripleWin has morphed into a software company that helps corporations in the midst of transformation. “The speed and the need for change is increasing for companies all the time,” Grönstrand says. “Big industries, such as banking, are facing real disruption due to digitalisation and large companies need to renew themselves.” Next for TripleWin is expansion and the company has already signed its first customers in the US and launched a Chicago-based office in late 2016. Chicago might be a surprising choice for a small Nordic technology company, but its participation in the ‘LandInChicago’ internationalisation programme last year sealed the deal for TripleWin. The programme, organised by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation   and the City of Chicago, opened doors to potential customers across the Windy City. “We booked 200 customer meetings in a month through the programme,” Grönstrand says. “This huge amount of feedback really helped to take the company forward. If you are planning to go the US, you need to carefully define what is your offering and who are the customers it fits.” Grönstrand also emphasises the importance of being close to your customers, which is why he is relocating to Chicago in August to lead TripleWin’s market charge. It is all part of the company’s vision to become a thought leader in digital change management. And TripleWin’s ambitions are high, as it aims to reach 100 million euros in turnover within the next five years. With the market for change management estimated to be worth over 550 billion dollars in the US alone, TripleWin believes it has managed to be in the right place at the right time. NOOA received the international Quality Innovation Award in business innovation series in February. Grönstrand is pictured holding the accolade."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/combi-works-factory-concept-demand/,Combi Works’ factory concept is in demand,"Finnish company Combi Works is remodelling manufacturing by combining digital tools and the surplus production power of factories around the globe. Manufacturing is in dire need of modernisation, believes  , the CEO of  . Instead of owning their own production facilities or managing rigid sourcing agreements, companies require fast, flexible delivery and the Helsinki-based company is making this a reality with its ‘Factory-as-a-Service’ (FaaS) concept. The idea is simple: most factories have surplus production capacity, but it rarely gets matched with companies in need of it. Combi Works wants to harness this extra capacity on a digital platform which analyses where is the fastest and most efficient place to manufacture each of its customer’s products. This enables the companies to react swiftly to market changes, scale production up or down as needed and focus their own resources on product development. “If you can standardise and manage production through a digital platform, you can move production where the demand is,” Blomstedt explains. “This means you need less storage and shorter logistics chains. The production is faster, more efficient and scalable.” What makes the model particularly ambitious is the company’s plan to include financing and insurance in the package to create a one-stop-shop for all aspects of the production chain. The origin of Combi Works lies in the years Blomstedt spent in Russia as a teenager while his mother was helping to launch the country’s first mobile operator. “We made a deal with mum to move to Russia for two years; it cost her a few Nintendo games and a dog, but it turned into six years,” he recalls with a laugh. “At the World Economic Forum one of the main focuses was ‘Industry 4.0,” says Edward Blomstedt. “I see it as an important thing, the talk about automatisation and robotics, but it still mainly looks at how a single factory can digitalise its operations [not the whole production chain].” Today Combi Works describes itself as a FaaS company. Instead of factories it owns production capacity and uses partners to manufacture everything from windmill parts and greenhouses, to solar-powered street lights and consumer products for its customers. Over the years the company has built a network of partner factories which cover nine countries, including Estonia, China and India. This is the network Combi Works is now tapping into as its expands its FaaS concept into a digital product. This process is boosted by two million euros in research funding from  , the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation. Combi Works is also collaborating with Finnish software house   to develop its digital management platform and integrate insurance and financing elements. “Currently, for example, banks finance the buyer of a tractor, its manufacturer and the factory all separately,” says Blomstedt. “Instead there could be a single [financing] pipeline following the product throughout the process.” Combi Works is not the first to talk about FaaS, but Blomstedt’s vision is to expand it to cover the whole manufacturing process and make the term the company’s own. “No factory has a 100 per cent utilisation rate and we think it makes more sense to use them more efficiently than build new factories,” Blomstedt explains. “With our model, there will be less idle factories and futile factory construction.” While Combi Works’ digital FaaS model is still a work in progress, the company is expecting to release the first demos this autumn and launch the platform in 2018. Ambitions are high: “With good luck, we will disrupt both the manufacturing and financing worlds,” Blomstedt declares. “So, just your typical nine-to-five job.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/docover-gives-phone-protection-a-second-glance/,DoCover gives phone protection a second glance,"The world is full of smartphone screen covers, but none quite like the ones from Finnish startup DoCover. The company has found its niche in bringing together protection, branding and fan products in one holographic package.  How many six-month old companies can say they have landed a deal with one of the world’s most famous football clubs? Our guess is not many, but Finnish startup   achieved just that in early 2017. The company   with the Spanish multi-billion-euro football club Real Madrid to use the club’s logo on its products: tempered glass screen protectors for mobile phones. “It is quite a start. The company was officially founded in September and at the turn of the year we signed a contract with one of the biggest sports brands in the world,” enthuses  , CEO and founder of DoCover. “This will help us enter discussions with any brand, it is such a great reference. We are already negotiating with several other clubs in Europe.” What convinced Real Madrid was DoCover’s unique offering. The startup is the only company in the world capable of producing screen protectors featuring a holographic image, in this case the Real Madrid logo. When you use the device, the image disappears. It is a subtle way to combine protection and branding. Atso Toimela admires his handiwork. “People look at their phones a few hundred times a day, so when there is a brand on the screen you see it thousands of times in a month,” explains Toimela. “We want to introduce brands people really like. It could be any sports club logo or a character, such as Bart Simpson.” The early days of DoCover began far from big consumer brands. Toimela was helping an IT leasing company to expand the lifespan of its devices when he started to think about branded protective products. 
DoCover was born when Toimela found a manufacturing partner in China and together the companies developed a technology for imprinting holographic images on tempered glass. Soon the startup had both a new product in its hands and the rights to a patent-pending technology. And DoCover has accelerated ever since. It entered the Finnish market last year with a licensing deal for Finland’s beloved Moomin characters and now the company is building distribution channels in Spain, Portugal and the UK (which are covered by the Real Madrid licensing deal), while chasing new brands to add to its portfolio. But the startup has not forgotten its B2B roots. DoCover also works with corporate customers and has produced branded screen protectors for companies such as champagne house Moët & Chandon. It has been a flying start, but DoCover’s three-member team knows it is continuous sales that make or break a business. “Our idea is to build partner networks in different countries who can do sales for us [in both consumer and B2B],” says Toimela. “We already have our first partners in Spain and Sweden and are looking for more in other markets. We also have negotiations starting in Australia.” DoCover is also leaving a door open for expanding its product offering. Licensing is a huge business with big brands looking to make money on anything from pens to bed sheets, but it is a strict selection process to determine which manufacturers make the cut. “Some brands want one company to license a whole category of products, which in our case could be mobile accessories such as covers, power banks, chargers,” Toimela explains. “While screen protectors are our main product, we have the capability to manufacture all of these through our Chinese partner.” If ambition levels could be measured by clients, DoCover has already scored. DoCover’s licensing deal with Real Madrid covers screen protector sales in Spain, Portugal and the UK. The products will also become available in the club’s own stores."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/one-poncho-unwind-us/,One poncho to unwind us all,"Finnish Jouten towel ponchos are practicality, sustainability and comfort sewn into the one outfit. The most important ingredient is a laid-back, feel-good mood.  delivers exactly what it says on the tin. In Finnish, to be   means to do absolutely nothing: to kick back, to relax, to lounge around. As per usual, no direct translation exists, but deem being   the Finnish version of the trendy Danish   and you’re pretty much on it. Jouten towel ponchos never stretch, pull or chafe. “The whole idea is that the poncho is so comfortable people can just pull it on and not have a worry in the world,”  , the creative mastermind of the product, explains. Emmi Lonka is the creative mastermind of Jouten. A very Finnish moment of   could be spent at the summer cottage terrace on a summer evening, just having rinsed off the sweat from the sauna in the refreshing lake. Birds singing, a cold beverage in hand, not a sign of mosquitos anywhere… It’s time to step down from your pedestal,  , there are others in the queue. The idea occurred to Lonka in 2015. She, being into watersports and having travelled a lot, had seen surfers wear a similar piece of clothing on public beaches to get in and out of their wetsuits without exposing too much skin. Her idea was to make the poncho to look nice and be as comfortable, as possible as well as produce them from sustainable materials. “I figured I had nothing to lose. I already had the machinery and the skills, and all I needed was something to do with them.” The first collection was very well received. Most of the over 100 ponchos Lonka has made so far have been sold in Finland, but some foreigners have been really excited about the product, too. Jouten ponchos have been shipped all the way to Australia and Japan. One reason for the interest abroad might lie in finding a piece of Finland underneath each poncho. The image of a nightless night at a summer cottage wearing a soft and colourful towel takes its wearer, at least mentally, to the lakeside of Finland – even from a living room in the neon-lit bustle of Tokyo. Despite this, Lonka points out that Jouten isn’t just a thing for meditation and mindfulness. It can also be used before and after doing extreme sports – or absolutely anything else. “If you want to meditate wearing the poncho, by all means go for it,” she notes. “I hope people use it for what suits them best.” Lonka collects her materials from recycling centres and through donations. For her, using good quality second-hand materials is one of the essentials of Jouten. Many customers find it important too, and not only for environmental reasons, but for the fact that this makes every Jouten piece unique. In the future, Lonka might broaden the product range to beach backpacks or hats. There is plenty of playroom with the poncho itself as well: she has already received requests from people hoping she could expand to hoodies. A second-hand towel hoodie handmade in Finland certainly sounds like something that could get trending on the streets in places like Japan and South Korea. “It could become a thing of fashion,” Lonka admits. “  could probably wear one.” Although West is yet to place his order, Lonka is in the process of designing the coming collection. By the time the pieces will have been shipped to their new owners,   might have taken over the limelight from   for good. The soft and colourful towel takes its wearer, at least mentally, to the lakeside of Finland."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cloudbounce/,CloudBounce masters anyone’s music,"Have a band but no extra money in pocket for getting your tracks mastered? Fear not: Finnish CloudBounce can help you get your group’s good tunes sound great and ready for distribution for only a fraction of the cost of traditional mastering services. There are many obstacles en route to becoming the best band in the world. Firstly, not anyone can write a hit song; secondly, not all those who can have the coin to get their sounds recorded and mastered professionally.  CEO and co-founder   knows this. The people behind the company are musicians themselves, and they knew first-hand how essential – yet expensive – mastering a catchy tune can be. The company was set up in the summer of 2015. Fast forward to now, and CloudBounce’s instant digital audio mastering service is being used in over 60 countries worldwide, its main target group being amateur musicians, bands, djs and sound designers. Mastering is an important part of a song’s birth process. According to Uimonen, a musician would have to put up minimum of 100 euros for getting a tune mastered by a professional. CloudBounce’s automated cloud service that analyses and processes the audio track has a price tag of less than five US dollars – which is not only way cheaper, but also much more convenient for the band. CloudBounce CEO Anssi Uimonen “Mastering tools can be laborious to learn,” Uimonen says. “We wanted to solve the problem on behalf of the masses we care about, which is amateur musicians.” He claims that for the 99 per cent of musicians around the world, an automated service like CloudBounce is good enough. “If you’re   and have thousands to spend on a mastering, yes, then it makes a difference. However, an amateur doesn’t need that level of service and interaction, and the difference in price is at least 20-fold.” Amateurs aren’t the only ones who have sat up and taken notice. The tech startup was also selected as the member of the Abbey Road RED incubator, run by the legendary London recording studio, Abbey Road, which continues to host many of the world’s biggest music stars. Furthermore, CloudBounce recently raised a 250 000-US dollar seed round. The investors included the UK-based VC Ascencion Ventures and a group of business angels from Finland and UK. The money will give the company a kick towards its next goal: improving the cloud-based service even further and boosting its marketing and sales efforts globally. “The funding can be deemed an impressive achievement, especially in times like these when money for music startups is scarce,” Uimonen notes. “This, together with being chosen to be a part of Abbey Road RED, goes to show we’re onto something.” At the moment, the team is working on making the service even more adaptive. On top of that, there are some big things in the horizon, but Uimonen doesn’t want to spill any beans yet. “I could say that what’s coming up will radically change the way music is consumed and experienced in the future,” he states mysteriously. “What that means, will be seen later this year.” CloudBounce was founded by three people, and now the team consists of five people working full-time and an extended team in Finland and the UK. In addition to its own team, CloudBounce’s partners include other music industry tech-heads, like Tracktion T7 Digital Audio Workstation, which offers its users the option to get their recorded tracks mastered on CloudBounce with the click of a button. CloudBounce isn’t the only group in the music business bandwagon, but one thing that helps it stand out in the crowded confines of the industry is being Finnish. “We’re known as the nation of perseverance, high technology skills and education,” Uimonen points out. “What we’re building today is world-class in terms of quality.” The vast majority of the service’s users come from the US, and second on the list the UK. This is because the two countries are inundated with bands wanting to break through. Finland forms only a small percentage of the overall sales. What is universal is that CloudBounc suits all music styles. According to Uimonen, CloudBounce is particularly popular among electronic, hip hop, r’n’b and rock music. But what kind of music is most appealing to this front man’s ear? “We play anything,” he says laughingly. “From drum & bass to rock’n’roll!” CloudBounce brings mastering to home computers."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rathamn-city/,Rathamn City spreads its sewers around the globe,"Despite having zero experience in the field, the Kangaspeska sisters decided to go for their mobile game idea anyway – and now there’s a whole PeliClan team behind Rathamn City. Publishing a game is a walk in the park. One click, and it’s out there in the digital wilderness. However, if you want your game to stand out in the vast sea of competitors and succeed, you can’t just let it out of the door and hope for the best.   and  , the creators of   and founders of  , are going to launch their game country by country, preferably travelling to the spot in person. “Pushing the button isn’t a big deal. The big deal is to see how far we can go if we do this as well as we can,” the two sisters say. “We have ambitious plans to make   succeed. If we didn’t put as much effort into marketing as we put into making a great game, that’d mean all the hard work goes to waste.” , a game in which the player’s task is to save rats and eventually the whole city of Rathamn, has already been released in Finland, and it’ll soon be available in the rest of the Nordic countries. After that, the two sisters are planning on focusing their efforts on India and South America – and eventually their rodents will be unleashed on the rest of the world. Thankfully, they are not alone in their sizeable quest to spread the ratty love. Peliclan has a pool of people helping with localisation, translations and general things needed in entering new markets. Currently there are team members based in Canada, India, Spain and the US. After its launch in Finland,   landed over 2 000 downloads within the first 24 hours. Once all possible countries enter the rat race, the figure should be much higher. “A million downloads. That’s the goal,” Lina and Sandra say. In the male-dominated field of gaming, being inexperienced or a woman hasn’t hindered the Peliclan duo. If anything, other Finnish gamemakers have been of huge help. Sandra (left) and Lina Kangaspeska are the masterminds of Rathamn City. “The atmosphere and team spirit are really good in the field of gaming,” Lina says. “Others aren’t seen as competitors, as we all want to see Finnish games do better and better.” Developing a mobile game was initially just a caprice. Sandra wanted to get creative with graphic design, music has been a hobby for Lina all her life, and a game seemed like something where both of these passions could be put to use. Then the idea of rats came about, and things quickly got serious. The rats seen adventuring in the sewers of Rathamn City are drawn by Sandra, and the music is composed by Lina. Initially the Kangaspeskas wanted to create a rat version of the traditional Finnish game  . Very little is left of the original idea, however, as the new Peliclaners joining the team meant that the idea was developed further and further. With the expanding team and the help of skilled coders, Rathamn City was born. “Our WhatsApp group is still called Rat Payazzo. For old times’ sake,” Sandra says laughingly. A lot of ideas have been flying around the game, and some flushed down the sewer. Its core strengths, if you ask its makers, are its catchiness – you cannot stop playing – and nostalgia. It’s simple and quick to learn, and get a little addicted to, say on a bus journey or in a doctor’s waiting room. Lina Kangaspeska points out that Sandra’s handwork has received praise from players. Her sketching skills were inspired by the Disney films the sisters saw as children, when things were still two-dimensional and hand-drawn. The game is free for players, and some extra features can be purchased. The sewer’s revenue stream comes from adverts, which have been made voluntary to make sure they don’t annoy users. Although a hit game could eventually turn into a source of income, both Kangaspeskas plan to finish their studies. Sandra is studying architecture, and Lina studies medicine. Even so, Rathamn City won’t for sure be the last game to come out of Peliclan teamwork; especially considering how much has been learned in the creative process and how much smoother and faster things will be next time. “We get new ideas all the time and hear ourselves saying ‘should we do this next?’” For now, the focus is fully on bringing Rathamn City from the sewers to the surface."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gemic-goes-extra-mile-customers-shoes/,Gemic goes the extra mile in customers’ shoes,"It’s not business, money and profit that determine where society is headed – it’s people. This Finnish consulting company refuses to focus on the best practices of today; instead, it looks at what will work best tomorrow. What does the value of a product or a brand boil down to? Is it the most advanced technology in the market or the most appealing design? No, says consulting company  . The strategic consultancy company explores ways in which value is created in the ordinary, everyday life. “There are strong forces that move the world, and a lot of them have nothing to do with economics,” notes co-founder  . Gemic’s consultants, very literally, walk in the footsteps of potential customers seeing, hearing and experiencing their needs, wants and wishes. If their customer wants to know what it is like to be a middle-class Chinese mother, Gemic will go find out. That’s the idea Gemic is based on. The word emic itself refers to something specific to a certain culture, such as a belief or a practice, seen from the perspective of someone from within that cultural system. The company takes an emic approach to business and compresses it into a gem – and this emic gem is what Gemic sells to companies the likes of Procter&Gamble, Braun, Fiskars and Audi. The company was founded in 2008 by Tamminen and  . The duo realised that not only Finland but the whole world was lacking a consulting company that could offer in-depth expertise on cultural aspects. A lot of companies, no matter how big, haven’t incorporated these elements in their business strategies. Gemic’s co-founder Sakari Tamminen (left) doing ethnographic field work in India. “It’s no longer about who does things most efficiently or for the lowest price – there’s always someone who can beat your price,” Tamminen points out. “There are other things that add value and experience.” Gemic doesn’t go after short-term business opportunities; rather, it seeks disruptive ideas. The goal is to figure out ways to make a product or a service genuinely wanted and valued. In the customer’s eyes, the product isn’t a sum of its components. “For example, owning an iPhone can link a person to the creative class sipping lattes in Brooklyn,” describes one of Gemic’s partners,  . “Or even better – to the thought of a new and better future. What people want from it is culture-specific.” One thing that distinguishes Gemic from its competitors is that they are present in the market but can sell knowledge from anywhere. In the US, where Gemic also has an office, a lot of consulting companies focus their expertise on the huge domestic market, whereas Gemic can go meet customers and talk about China, Brazil or India. , a Gemic partner, points out that Gemic has been able to harness top-notch talent from all over the world and even managed to convince some of them to move to Helsinki. The two-man company has grown into a team of 20, and few are of the same nationality. A lot of ‘Gemics’ have multidisciplinary backgrounds, Leskelä himself being an excellent example, as he’s studied both theology and finance. Most of the team has studied social sciences, which makes it easier to shift the focus away from mere money. “The most important characteristic is the ability to think,” Leskelä says. “You need to be a creative thinker and able to convey your thoughts.” Gemic’s customers are global organisations. The biggest market exists in the US, but in the near future the company plans to cross a smaller sea and head to Sweden. “So far we’ve ignored our neighbour, but there are plenty of firms that could benefit immensely from our help,” Leskelä tells. “That’s what we’re fixing now.” A lot of multinationals are asking Gemic’s help with China. The growing Chinese middle class is of interest to numerous big companies, but due to cultural differences strategies need to be thought out carefully. To answer the demand, Gemic is planning to open an office in Shanghai at some point. Gemic’s help is requested all over the globe. “Where we go next depends mainly on us deciding where to focus our efforts on,” Leskelä notes. “Our approach is so new that we just need to choose where we want to grow.” Gemic’s reference list includes multinational corporations, and also fellow Finns such as Fazer and Fiskars."

When companies are mapping out their future, the possibility of war is perhaps not something that they typically take into account. Yet, when conflict erupted in Ukraine in 2014, local startup   saw the Russian-speaking customer base for its Internet solution practically evaporate overnight. “From the very beginning we had created promotions on social media, like contests, sweepstakes and lotteries,” recalls company co-founder  . “Suddenly, no-one was advertising on social media networks or doing fun stuff.” With its users consumed with writing and reporting on the escalating situation, the decision was made to revamp PromoRepublic’s offering, move west and eventually plant roots at Helsinki’s   accelerator. “Soon I was totally integrated into the startup ecosystem in Finland,” Pecherskyi explains. “Startup Sauna doesn’t take equity, and helps to accelerate traction. We quickly had Finnish angel investors onboard and learned about Tekes. Investors really trust Startup Sauna’s references.” The six-week intensive programme also saw Pecherskyi taken under the wing of coaches, as he tweaked what would eventually become PromoRepublic’s content marketing software as a service. “Startup Sauna is an instrument for the best people from the Finnish ecosystem, who have reached everything in their entrepreneurial career, to give back to society,” Pecherskyi recalls. “These really, really cool guys spent lots of time and soul to push us forward. All possible contacts are provided and positioning on the market. It really works.” CEO Max Pecherskyi PromoRepublic’s resultant solution is spearheaded by the Calendar of Content Ideas, software as a service that helps to create social media posts based on holidays, trends, events and beyond. “Your content calendar is never empty, it is filled with ideas based on the context of each day,” Pecherskyi explains. “It could be historical dates, some events happening right now or also trends and topics on social networks. Each of these post ideas is made by several templates, prewritten and predesigned by our team.” Alongside multi-posting, PromoRepublic’s solution also contains a tool that helps to create the optimal time for posting content. “It’s kind of a ‘schedule, launch and forget’ solution,” Pecherskyi summarises. After achieving good traction in Eastern Europe, the company recently announced it had   and is seeking to duplicate its success Stateside. Keeping its offices in Helsinki (business) and Kiev (R&D) for the time being, the shift in location focus has also resulted in one of strategy, as there are already ample social media marketing platforms existing in the US. PromoRepublic’s competitive advantage comes from filling a gap in automisation. Thus it has switched from serving small businesses owners to targeting the marketing freelancers and agencies that perform social media marketing services for SMEs. “We have created integration with Hootsuite and Buffer, two major players,” Pecherskyi explains. “The aim is to build relationships with those guys, so they can help us promote the content creation ad-on to their huge customer base.” Now, having already accumulated over 100 paying customers in the US, PromoRepublic is seeking to boost its employee base to meet demand. Along with an increase in personnel will come one of funding – the company is looking to raise another round at the end of the year. “We are on track in the US and are aiming for monthly revenues of 30 000 US dollars and 200-300 paid customers by the end of the year,” Pecherskyi outlines. “We believe having this traction makes us really interesting for investors.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sunit-cleans-vehicle-computing/,Sunit cleans up with in-vehicle computing,"The mobile innovations of this Kajaani-based company have been making waves worldwide for the past two decades. In terms of on-the-job danger, which professions do you think represent the greatest risk of sustaining personal injury? Interestingly, in the United States solid waste haulers rank third on the list, behind fishing and timber cutting. In fact, garbage collectors are injured around five to seven times more than the average worker. One obvious way alleviate this problem would be to remove any human contact between the truck and the garbage waste itself, right? Well, then perhaps a leaf could be taken out of Australia’s book. Thanks to the help of Finnish in-vehicle computer innovators  , local waste disposal company JJ Richards and Sons has already made such a change. Some five years ago, no less. These days, hundreds of garbage trucks Down Under are equipped with Sunit’s fixed-mount computers, which help do the heavy lifting along with an innovative software programme from an Australian customer. Amongst other things, the system can identify between various waste bins on the side of the road according to the allocated colour of their lids. Such is the efficiency of this approach that although drivers work unaccompanied whilst operating the hydraulic lifting arm, the company’s volume of collection has increased significantly since implementation. “They collect 600 bins per truck per day,” states  , Sunit’s head of sales and marketing. “The client designed a very rapid system. The application also takes a photo of the bin, what’s inside. It sends the picture and invoice to the customer and then sends customer statistics to the community.” Sunit has nine different multi-purpose models on offer. This extensive innovation is just one of Sunit’s many success stories over the past 20 years. However, its business focus has not merely been confined to waste disposal during this time. The company’s globally certified computers also tackle a wide range of applications tailored for the likes of fuel transport vehicles, public transport, ambulances, fire engines, police cars, taxis, mining and forest trucks. Currently, Sunit has nine different multi-purpose models on offer. Alongside meeting the challenges found on-road, off-road, in urban environments and industry, one of the main strengths of its offering is durability. “The medium lifetime is more than 10 years,” Suutari says. “It’s a very safe product, there is no risk for fire or personal injuries in case of an accident.” From its home base in the town of Kajaani, Sunit has consistently expanded its customer base over the past two decades. Alongside Finland and Australia, its customers can also be found across Europe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Chile and Canada. Given the fluctuations of the international market, the company is constantly broadening its scope, with one common thread. “We try to find customers who require special types of computers, mostly in the purpose logistic business,” Suutari explains. “This is a vehicle that does not know in the morning where it will end up in the evening.” And, as Sunit continues its quest for attracting further business abroad, this doesn’t mean that it will be making compromises in quality – or price – any time soon. “Our customers say, ‘you are good, but you are expensive’,” Suutari says. “But I say that, ‘yeah, but I’m looking for customers who are successful in their business.” Given the company’s longevity, it’s fair to say that it has been well and truly able to find such. “It’s better to have those kinds of customers, yes,” Suutari states. “They ask for quality and durability and they look for trusted partners.” The company’s globally certified computers are also used by police cars, fuel transport vehicles, public transport, ambulances, fire engines, taxis, mining and forest trucks."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arilyn-adds-new-dimensions-everyday-experiences/,Arilyn adds new dimensions to everyday experiences,"Arilyn, an augmented reality service by Finland-based Robust North, is not about creating new worlds; rather, it is about bringing new elements to the world we know. “The point is not to get people put on virtual glasses and go to another dimension. Rather, we want to add things into the reality they already are in, not as passive bystanders but active contributors,” says Emmi Jouslehto, CEO of Robust North. A singer steps out of the album cover to talk to the person who just bought the album; or the model posing in the cover of a magazine actually moves and speaks. Sci-fi, anyone? No – it’s augmented reality, seen through your mobile device with the help of an application called  . As brands are rushing to find new ways of engaging the masses of millennials,   provides them a new tool for adding value to their commercials and other content. CEO   describes Arilyn as a way of changing the way people see and interact with the world. “With Arilyn, any surface works as an invitation to virtual reality,” Jouslehto says. Arilyn consists of two products: the free mobile app Arilyn, which is targeted at consumers, who use it to see and interact with the virtual content made with Arilyn Manager, the online portal on which companies create and manage their content. According to Jouslehto, the product is mainly aimed at marketing, media, and entertainment industries. She believes augmented reality will soon be a similar business standard as mobile services. “Not all companies had a website in the 90s, but it did not take long for everyone to get there. Now everyone is on mobile, too, and the first businesses are using virtual reality.” Robust North was founded by Jouslehto, creative director   and CTO  . Jouslehto and Laurila have a background in IT and Kähönen has worked in music and film. The first version of the app was published in September 2014, and Arilyn Manager was launched in March 2015. The goal is to see augmented reality to move on from one-off campaigns to being a part of continuous communications strategies. “The point is not to get people put on virtual glasses and go to another dimension,” Jouslehto says. “Rather, we want to add things into the reality they already are in, not as passive bystanders but active contributors.” Jouslehto thinks new opportunities will rise when devices such as Google Glasses are comfortable and inconspicuous enough for consumers. The Robust North team members keep their eyes peeled for new innovations in the field. “The situation has changed radically from that of a year ago. People are much more familiar with augmented and virtual realities, which helps us in pushing it forward.” Jouslehto says that the AR/VR scene is very strong in Finland – and that the expertise is recognised internationally. In addition to its homeland, Robust North has customers in Hungary, Israel, Brazil, and Estonia, and more are on their way. Now Robust North has a team of six, including its founders. Jouslehto says the plan is to recruit technology and sales development professionals, and she estimates that the company might have about a dozen new employees in a year’s time. “It all depends on how the progress in augmented and virtual reality in general goes. It might surprise us, and if things take big steps quickly, we must be able to take the jump with it.” Brands are rushing to find new ways of engaging the masses. For example, it’s not unusual that a singer steps out of the album cover to talk to the person who just bought the album."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/meater-brings-timely-innovation-barbequing/,Meater brings timely innovation to barbequing,"A wireless smart meat thermometer is no longer on the backburner for this Finnish engineer. The night had begun quietly for friends and colleagues   and  a couple of years ago. Laughing and swapping stories over a few glasses of wine, suddenly they were interrupted by a piercing alarm coming from the barbeque. The cables of the meat thermometer had burnt through, once again. Nivala shrugged his shoulders. Over the years he had become the not-so-proud owner of numerous thermometers in various states of disrepair. It was now the perfect time to tell his business partner of a plan he had been cooking up for some time: the world’s first truly wireless smart meat thermometer. “  takes the concept of remote monitoring to cook perfect meat every single time,” Nivala explains. “It’s very convenient.” And then some: the only alert wannabe chefs are guaranteed to hear in the future is a notification sent to the Meater app on their smartphones, indicating that their meat has reached its desired internal temperature. Or, should they happen to miss it, the same notification is also automatically sent to a friend. As the summer grilling season is on full heat, the Meater team has been covering all their bases in readiness for its July shipping date. “We have additional features that know the right temperature to cook different types of meat,” Nivala explains. “It also gives an estimated completion time.” Meater thermometer indicates to the Meater app when meat has reached its desired internal temperature. Additionally, Meater can accurately estimate the resting temperature, for the final stage of the cooking process. Along with a rechargeable battery lasting around 48 hours, basically now all you need to do is find the cut of meat that you want to enjoy. Many have agreed ­– the product has already attracted two million US dollars in crowdfunding. “It’s been wonderful to get feedback from Kickstarter and Indiegogo,” Nivala states. “Obviously it was a good place to get some presales and cash into the company, but more importantly to validate the idea, so when we finish it’s going to be exactly what people want.” And which markets are salivating the most for Meater? The US is by far the most enthusiastic, with considerable interest also coming from Australia, Canada, Germany, the UK and the Nordics. Originally from the northern Finnish town of Raahe, Nivala currently resides in Leicester, UK. Although Cruz is based in Los Angeles, the geographical distance between the duo is nothing new for their working relationship. Indeed, earlier they were colleagues for eight years at a well-known electronics company, producing over 40 products together whilst living in separate countries. Nonetheless, even when stationed outside its borders, Nivala hasn’t forgotten his Finnish roots. “A fair share of the work for the Meater project has been done in Finland,” he explains. “Many of the people involved I know from my engineering days in Tampere. I lean back to contacts I have and use them for freelance work.” The international group behind Meater also shares something else in common that’s decidedly Finnish. In celebration of their Kickstarter campaign exceeding one million US dollars, Nivala recently invited the team to northern Finland for a winter’s dip in the icy lake water of Pudasjärvi. “It was a fun thing,” he recalls, with a laugh. “Hopefully it was exotic enough for our Californian backers and my business partner.” One thing’s for sure: if the swim was followed by a traditional Finnish feast of grilled sausages, there’s little doubt that the meat would have been cooked to perfection."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sharper-shape-finds-solution-sky/,Sharper Shape finds a solution in the sky,"Flying well ahead of the competition, this fleet of drones is cutting costs for the electricity industry. Either way you approach it, Mumbai is a breathtaking experience. A vibrant commercial hotspot, teeming with life, the Indian metropolis is home to 20 million people. Each of these residents has their own unique story. Many too have stars in their eyes, for here resides the birthplace of Bollywood. Fittingly, there was no shortage of star power on hand last spring when Finnish company   signed a collaboration agreement in Mumbai with Sterlite Grid. This contract with India’s largest developer of private transmission systems was inked in the presence of Finnish Prime Minster  , who was in town to promote Finnish business opportunities. “Going there together with the Prime Minister really pushed things forward,” recalls Sharper Shape chairman  . “The guys at Sterlite Grid were eager to do the signing.” Such enthusiasm is being increasing met by this Finnish company. “We apply unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), advanced sensor systems and analytics for power line inspection,” Salmenlinna explains. “Our focus right now is on electricity transmission and distribution. Other assets such as railroads, bridges, roads, oil and gas infrastructure are very relevant for us as well.” Widely known as drones, Sharper Shape’s UAVs use advanced algorithms to significantly reduce inspection and maintenance costs by identifying potential hazards and weak points in the power distribution network. These include the likes of trees posing a risk to power outages during storms, along with broken insulators and infrastructure corrosion. The company has taken off quickly since it was established in 2013. Collaborating with the Finnish power industry early on in the piece was a shrewd move, giving it unprecedented foresight to the industry’s prospects. As a result, plans for manned helicopters and foot patrols were quickly scuppered in favour of drones. Sharper Shape then worked with the Finnish Civil Aviation Authority to explore ways in which they could maximise the potential of propeller power. Its big breakthrough came when Finland began to allow commercial flying of drones beyond visual line of sight – one of the first countries worldwide to do so. “This created a competitive advantage for us here, which we have now been able to utilise when opening other markets,” Salmenlinna comments. Sharper Shape signed a collaboration agreement in Mumbai with India-based Sterlite Grid. Pictured from the left: Janne Jussila, Director Sales and Marketing, Sharper Shape, Juha Sipilä, Prime Minister of Finland, Samuel Salmenlinna, Chairman of the Board, Sharper Shape, Aapo Pölhö, Ambassador of Finland to India, Pravin Agarwal, Chairman of Sterlite Power Grid Ventures, Shreyas Kirtilal Doshi, Honorary Consul of Finland in India and Pratik Agarwal, Vice Chairman of Sterlite Power Grid Ventures. Alongside its ballooning success in India, Sharper Shape is also eagerly awaiting the green light from another significant marketplace: the USA. The regulation for flying drones beyond the visual line of sight is set to open there later this year. “We are applying the very same concept as we did in Finland,” Salmenlinna explains. “We are working together with the Federal Aviation Administration and the power industry there to enable flight beyond visual line of sight in the context of electricity transmission and distribution.” Such familiarity gives the company a significant competitive advantage over the competition. Local offices have already been established in Palo Alto and North Dakota in anticipation of a bright future. “We have a real chance to be the US market leader in a very short period of time,” Salmenlinna admits. A breakthrough Stateside will open the floodgates for a wave of drones disrupting the way utility and asset owners do business. For Salmenlinna this is in keeping with theories of the imminent Fourth Industrial Revolution, one where robots assume many of the tasks that humans currently undertake. “One core part of this revolution is advanced algorithms, analytics and self-learning systems,” he states. “We are at the forefront of this major megatrend.”"

Amidst the feverish fan frenzy of promotional duties for   late last year, star   often told the story of how he used to be a carpenter before becoming Han Solo. In fact, had he not won the iconic role back in 1976, Ford may very well be professionally putting hammer to nail this very day. Interestingly, he is not alone in the completely-different-jobs-before-my-career department. Did you know that   was once a high school gym teacher and   a janitor, for example? Not to be outdone, the CEO of positioning technologies platform provider  ,  , also had a very different focus when opportunity came knocking a few years ago. “I am actually an archaeologist,” she explains. “I did my master’s in museum curating – modern art. My thesis research was on how applications are used inside museums.” For this Koskiola sought a tool that could guide visitors around the museum and react to their physical location. However, when researching the necessary tech, she came up empty-handed. “I called my sister’s husband, who’s our CTO now, and asked him why aren’t museums using indoor positioning technologies,” Koskiola recalls. “He said it’s a really complicated field; it’s not as easy as outdoor GPS. That’s where the whole idea started rolling.” And roll it did. Straight past the idea of a single app into a much wider playing field. Annina Koskiola, CEO of positioning technologies platform provider Proximi.io, was facilitating the launch of the platform at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Proximi.io is a technology-agnostic platform that embraces a variety of positioning technologies via a single API. Free to begin using, the platform caters to Indoor Atlas, Ibeacon, Eddystone beacons, Wi-Fi, GPS and cellular navigation. “During the last three years there have been a lot of new indoor navigation technologies popping up, but the field is also really confusing,” Koskiola says. “We make it really easy and simple for developers who want to use location awareness on their apps.” The platform enables a variety of rich geo-targeted action flow chains. Position data in complex interactions is leveraged easily, including push and fetch information from external databases, as well as adding shifts and rules, and automatising IoT devices. Furthermore, Proximi.io can be used to collect anonymous analytics about each specific app user’s movements. Unsurprisingly, many have sat up and taken notice. Most notable among these was Nordic business angel syndicate NordicBAN, whose members last year invested 300 000 euros in the company. With this capital boost facilitating the launch of the platform to overwhelmingly enthusiastic receptions at SXSW in Austin and CeBIT in Hannover, the future is looking very bright for Proximi.io. Above all, the biggest interest group for such location-aware app development comprises retailers targeting passing shoppers and tracking customers in store. “Indoor mobile marketing is really big in the States,” Koskiola observes. “One-third of the biggest retailers there have already started piloting with beacons, or are planning to do so. Research has said that 3.5 million beacons will be installed in various retailers by the end of 2018.” Even so, Koskiola remains reluctant to limit Proximi.io’s relevance to one specific sector. She lists gyms, events and tracking one’s assets as some other potential uses for the technology, also making note of a university project charting attendance and a workplace app for monitoring employee movements. Situated among all this potential, Koskiola also remains hopeful of realising her original vision. “I still have thoughts on museums,” she states. “It is a sector that could really benefit from indoor positioning.” Proximi.io doesn’t want to limit its relevance to one specific sector; for example gyms, events and museums could use the indoor navigation technology."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/helsinki-central-library-emerges-from-the-needs-of-the-city-residents/,Helsinki Central Library emerges from the needs of city residents,"Already dubbed the new cradle of citizen engagement, the new Helsinki Central Library will rise in the city centre with the power of its citizens’ ideas. The new Helsinki Central Library, due to open in 2018, was designed for the urban dwellers of Helsinki by the residents themselves. That’s the reason why the new library will have, among other things, a movie theatre, music studio, restaurant, open workspaces and a “citizen balcony” – not to forget the traditional library space, of course. “If you think of a library as a space, it’s one of the few places people can meet and interact openly and across all the levels of society,” says Virve Miettinen, participation planner of Helsinki City Library. The participatory planning of the Central Library began with a “megaphone invitation” to all citizens: opinion leaders and celebrities encouraged people to come up with fresh and groundbreaking ideas that the new library could adopt. Once the open and cooperative planning had gotten off to an impressive start, it continued in different ways, such as with participatory budgeting, an architecture competition, and policymaker networking activities and workshops directed at partners. In autumn 2014, a developer community called the Central Library’s Friends was founded, and the library was envisioned as a place for experimenting, learning, 21st century civics and peer learning, along with the enrichment of ideas and thoughts, and acting as a service provider for immigrants and tourists. For the Central Library, service design means designing the premises and services together with the library users while taking advantage of user-centric methods. In recent years there has been a shift in thinking; user-centredness used to mean examining users as focus groups and targets of design but nowadays users themselves participate in planning by brainstorming. The new Helsinki central library, designed by Finnish Ala Architects, is a masterpiece of timber construction, eco-efficiency and almost zero-energy building. “We noticed that visitors feel a stronger ownership of the library and visit it more when they have been included in the planning,” notes  director of Helsinki City Library. The participation of residents in generating ideas for the Central Library will not be a one-time thing, but instead the doctrine is to be applied to the whole of Helsinki’s library network. One of greatest challenges in participatory design is finding the right balance in the plurality of participants’ voices. “You cannot lose the spectrum of voices,” Miettinen says. “Even though participation is open, it mustn’t lead to uniformity.” One participant, for example, wants a quiet, traditional library, while another would like plenty of open space for activities and the newest technology. Thanks to its design, it is possible to incorporate almost everything. “For too long, organisations have been looking inwards at their own functions”, says  , head of development at Helsinki City Library. “The users come to an organisation from the outside, and see things which the organisation does not. The organisation would do well to listen to these fresh new thoughts.” The new library will have, among other things, a movie theatre, music studio, restaurant, open workspaces, and a wide sun terrace."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/risu-gets-root-beard-grooming/,Risu gets to the root of beard grooming,"Finland’s first premium beard oil specialists seek to change the global manscape for the better. Beards are seemingly everywhere these days. Whilst this sea of hairy faces is nothing new in the stylish scheme of things (see ZZ Top,   and even Santa Claus), the rise of the hipster has nonetheless seen men worldwide embracing their facial follicles in a rapidly growing fashion. Here in Finland, wearing a beard is as much about the look as it is practical, with a layer of fur providing protection from the often-bracing elements. Nonetheless, regardless of one’s motivation for cultivation, even the most wild and carefree growth needs a little maintenance sometimes. “I always had a beard since it started to grow: it’s an essential part of me,” explains  , CEO of  . “I used to order beard oil from Amazon UK. Then one day I thought, why am I doing it like this – why is it not easier?” The simple reason was that there was nothing suitable on shelves from local producers. So, teaming up with his sister,  , the siblings set out to become Finland’s pioneering premium beard oil producers. Drawing on his background in finance and IT and his sister’s expertise in product development, the fruit of their labour arrived in the Risu webstore and Finnish barbershops earlier this year. Currently, three varieties of oil are on offer – two with fragrance and one without – along with a seasonal option, depending on what’s available at any given time. Risu beard oil’s Finnish touch comes from sea buckthorn oil. “The main ingredient for all is argan oil from Morocco,” Weckström explains. “The Finnish touch comes from sea buckthorn oil. Other essential oils are there too to make the beard soft, shiny, groom easily, and also treat the skin underneath.” Yes, bearded types out there rejoice – it’s time to bid farewell to embarrassing rashes and flakes of ‘beardruff’. And it’s not just Finns with a smile on their well-groomed faces. Risu is currently targeting the EU market, in anticipation of going global. So, in lieu of prospective customers’ lack of Finnish language skills, what does the name mean, exactly? “A   is a small stick, and also refers to your beard when it’s messy,” Weckström offers. “It’s a double meaning, reflecting how we value things: Finnish nature and quality.” The company has also embraced a slogan to ‘Finnish your style’, suggesting that its beard oil is merely the first of many offerings to come. Sitting under the summer sun in southern Helsinki, Weckström is affable company, talking enthusiastically about the business of beards and Risu’s worldly potential. Yet, there is one topic that makes his smile temporarily dip below the horizon: shampoo. More specifically, when it emerges that this writer’s own beard maintenance consists of using what should only be applied to the top of the head, without further ado, I am sent home with a bottle of Risu. The next morning I wash my beard with water, using the bottle’s Pasteur pipette to squeeze a couple of drops onto my hands. Rubbing them together to warm up the oil, the pleasant resin fragrance is in welcome contrast to the aggressive hyper-masculinity of many products. After spending a moment applying the oil and massaging the skin, I stand back to admire my handiwork. The effect is pretty much instantaneous: my beard is softer to the touch, replete with a healthy sheen. Needless to say, with Risu subsequently becoming a prominent part of my daily routine, my   has yet to be seen since.

You might be able to see what the clothes look like, but you can’t see what they would look like on your type of body. Finnish startup   has created an online styling room to solve this problem. They turn a simple webstore into an interactive shopping experience. “I was at home with my two kids struggling to buy clothes online,” says  , the company’s founder and CEO. “There were only static pictures with no interaction. I thought that the experience should be centred on the user. So the idea started from my own personal frustration.” Stylewhile allows a shopper to find an appropriate body type and then mix and match different items to see how they would look either singly or in combinations. Playing around with the service is entertaining, and that is no surprise: Haaramo spent many years at gaming powerhouse Digital Chocolate. “My background in gaming definitely helped,” she says. “Games are fun and interactive for users. I believe that the online shopping experience can be like games.” Stylewhile’s business idea came from CEO Jutta Haaramo’s own personal frustration with buying clothes online. Stylewhile received a significant boost in 2013 when it partnered with Saks Fifth Avenue. Working with a recognised fashion brand name gave the company a lot of publicity, such as a glowing mention from   magazine. “We learned a lot from working with Saks Fifth Avenue,” Haaramo continues. “For example, we learned how to make the buying process simple. We also realised that you can’t be tied to one device or platform.” One reason why Stylewhile is attractive to such retailers is that the technology uses their clients’ existing images of models and products. “From the very beginning we wanted to use the pictures without the physical products,” Haaramo explains. “We use the images, not the products, so there is no need to ship sample clothes to us or reshoot new pictures.” Although the Saks deal garnered attention in the US, Stylewhile’s main customers at present are European retailers. These stores don’t have the resources to build an interactive shopping experience on their own, so instead they partner with Stylewhile. Stylewhile allows a shopper to find an appropriate body type and then mix and match different items to see how they would look singly or in combinations. The company continues to turn heads in the industry. Stylewhile was named a finalist for the Topshop Challenge, a competition to find the best startup technology to enhance the shopping experience for customers. While all of the other contestants were from either the UK or US, the eventual winner was Finland’s Stylewhile. “It’s great to see such responses both from individuals and the fashion industry,” says Haaramo. Major venture capitalists like Finland-based   and Lifeline Ventures have backed the company, allowing them to continually refine their solution. Haaramo says they are fine-tuning their experience and learning from customer feedback. “I love this challenge of entrepreneurship,” she concludes. “There are so many opportunities around the corner. I can’t wait to see where it will take us.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/stupid-stupid-games-makes-name/,Stupid Stupid Games makes a name for itself,"Why start small, when you can introduce a world filled with games, books, comics and endless stories? A few years ago, as aspiring fantasy and speculative fiction author  ’s fourth decade of existence was drawing to a close, so too appeared a brick wall of reality. “I was progressing as a writer, but I wasn’t as good as I hoped I would be,” he recalls. “Basically every time I should have been writing, I was playing games. I really wanted to do games. I loved them, but I didn’t have the confidence. I figured you had to do technological mumbo jumbo and know people.” Nonetheless, taking to heart the old adage that “life begins at 40”, Kyrönseppä figured it was now or never. He promptly enrolled to university to pursue his dream. As fate would have it, Kyrönseppä met some of his future   colleagues during the first week of his studies. Brought together by the common goal of founding a company, they began tapping into the vast expanses of his imagination. However, it soon became apparent that the ideas within couldn’t be restrained by a sole format. Rather than focus their creative energies on one game or book, they decided to emulate the likes of Marvel, DC Comics and Star Wars and create a universe. Or, in industry terms, intellectual property (IP), that would encompass characters, stories, names, places and the brand itself. Yet, whereas these franchises gradually prised open the possibilities created by success in a particular format, their world would be immediately renderable across practically any type of game or story platform. But, whenever the students sought guidance for which step to take towards building their IP, they repeatedly came up empty handed. “There’s nothing, not a single book or article on the topic,” Kyrönseppä states. “So, I ended up doing the research myself, studying comic books, toys and stuff.” Listening to Kyrönseppä describe the end result, it’s clear his quest for knowledge was worth it.   intertwines elements of Heaven and Hell, rebirth and reincarnation, and a ian monster. One intriguing story arc sees Satan’s son, dubbed Johnny Graves, spurning the family trade and living a simple life of leisure. Needless to say, Dad’s not too impressed with this turn of events. “Life begins at 40”: a few years ago Jussi Kyrönseppä quit his career as a writer and enrolled to university to pursue his dream. Soon enough Stupid Stupid Games was born. On the contrary, many have been very enthusiastic about what Stupid Stupid Games is setting out to achieve. Now graduated, the company boasts over 20 employees and has successfully closed an equity crowdfunding round at  . Meanwhile, their first game is being released, having received the green light from Steam. As the wind fills the company’s sails, Kyrönseppä is adamant about breaking new ground with this all-in approach. “If you have a scalable IP you need to prove that it can be scaled,” he declares. “If it’s something innovative, something that others have not figured out yet, how would you prove it if you don’t actually do it? Finally, in the face of all this bold trailblazing, one has to ask: What’s up with the ‘stupids’? Whilst the word itself holds few positive connotations, when presented back-to-back, one begins to ponder the possibility of harnessing the power of double negatives. “The name is ironic,” Kyrönseppä admits, with a smile. “It’s a safety valve as well. We can do stupid stuff, because we don’t call ourselves stupid for nothing.” [laughs] Could it also be that ‘Pioneering Pioneering Games’ just doesn’t have the same ring to it?"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/small-business-success-tale-two-finnish-stores/,Small business success: A tale of two Finnish stores,"As Finland’s economy emerges from several years of recession, it is small businesses that have traditionally lead such recoveries, and which could change the way the economy functions in future.  In a gleaming stainless steel Espoo kitchen, Master Chocolatier   carefully pours tempered chocolate into truffle moulds. A few minutes later, cooled on a marble slab, the organic chocolate shells are ready to be filled with taste combinations like gin and juniper, or balsamic strawberry. A few kilometres away in downtown Helsinki, 1950s rockabilly music plays in the background as   carefully draws her cutthroat razor against the taut skin of a customer’s lathered-up neck, giving him a traditional shave as he reclines in a vintage, up-cycled barbers chair. Bryn Phipps moved to Finland from London two years ago and made his dream come true: an organic chocolate business. The two small businesses seem worlds apart, but in fact have much in common. They both launched during the worst years of Finland’s economic slump, and they both expanded already in 2016: Phipps’   moved to new premises, adding a showroom, storage space and a bigger kitchen. Walden opened   in Helsinki’s Töölö neighbourhood, focusing on high-end grooming products and accessories, to compliment her nearby original Classic Barber Shop. These businesses are not isolated examples of intrepid entrepreneurs taking a gamble during a recession. In fact, small businesses make up the largest share of enterprises in Finland. “You can find small businesses everywhere, because Finland is a country of small enterprise, and small employer enterprises,” says  , a senior statistician at Statistics Finland. “Most of the jobs are created in small enterprises,” he adds. According to official figures, there are more than 350 000 small businesses operating in Finland – employing one to ten people. That’s 1.4 million people in total, with 30 per cent of them in the service industry. And that makes small businesses a powerful engine at the heart of the Finnish economy. So what sort of businesses are these? It could be sole traders or limited companies. It might be someone with a fixed job, and a second job for extra income, or someone working from home sitting at their kitchen table. It can be people employed in tourism or construction; manufacturing businesses or artisans; family businesses that have been passed down through several generations; agricultural workers on farms; coffee shops in rural towns and villages; software developers and graphic design collectives in the city…or bespoke chocolatiers and on-trend barbers. Phipps and his partner   moved to Finland from London just two years ago with a dream to start their own organic chocolate business. Brynn had worked in a   restaurant, and also in Helsinki’s fashionable restaurant Gaijin. But it took a leap of faith to launch Arctic Choc. Arctic Choc offers even dairy-free milk and white chocolates, as well as organic vegan chocolate where the company spotted a gap in the market. “It was challenging to start our own business,” says Phipps, a 26-year old who grew up in South West England. “It took us six months to get everything organised, and all the paperwork. We had to have a plan of how and why we were going to do stuff. And obviously it was a lot of pressure on Tiia because it all had to be done in Finnish, and she had to translate it all. It was a long process.” Arctic Choc got its initial financing for specialist equipment and kitchen rental from Finnish banks, and the business has continued to take bank loans in order to expand, and keep up with demand for their products. “The main benefits are to be our own boss, to make all our own decisions,” explains Phipps. “But the main challenge is making yourself known and unique, to stand out from the competitors.” With products now stocked in more than 60 Finnish supermarkets and boutique shops, their business plan seems to be working well. Arctic Choc is expanding its offerings with dairy-free milk and white chocolates, as well as organic vegan chocolate where they spotted a gap in the market. “We have to keep up with trends,” says Westman. “We have to keep things new, and not stay the same.” Nina Walden took a totally different route to setting up her businesses, financing her stores herself without taking bank loans. Walden took a totally different route to setting up her businesses, financing her stores herself without taking bank loans. She wasn’t really aware if there was any official government help to launch a small business, and the ongoing recession wasn’t something she thought about too much either. “The economy is not great, but I don’t think of it as a risk to expand the business,” explains the 34-year old. “But then again, I didn’t have to take any money from anywhere, I had my own money,” she adds. Inside her new gentlemen’s grooming shop, niche products from Finland and abroad sit on old wooden shelves. The razors and mustache wax, badger bristle shaving brushes and beard oil might be specialist products – and priced accordingly – but the second shop has been a success since opening in April. “My business is blooming… and the economy always picks up,” says Walden. “And anyway, I am not too scared to fail.” , who teaches entrepreneurship at Helsinki’s Hanken School of Economics, says that the nature of small businesses differs across Finland, from urban areas to rural. “If you look at cities, there are simple businesses like shops,” Stenbeck explains and continues, “But in the countryside someone might run the local post office, they are the local transportation company, they rent out their summer cottages and things like that” Stenbeck says that the way small businesses operate is also changing, as people adapt to new ways of working, and the new opportunities that technology brings. “In Finland we see Wolt and Foodora who do transportation for restaurant – students might do that, and at night drive for Uber. Small businesses, how they influence the Finnish economy, that will gradually change. It will become a more multi-faceted entrepreneurship-driven, small business economy.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/robbo-s-code-learning-no-limits/,Robbo’s code of learning has no limits,"This Finnish-Russian company has developed robotics that enable users to develop their coding skills in the classroom and beyond. Next time you are standing at the traffic lights, try and resist the urge to restlessly push the button more than once. Contrary to what your instincts may tell you, this actually won’t speed up the process. “It doesn’t help,” confirms  ’s program manager  . “It just confuses the system. Pressing the button sends signals to a timer that will only switch on in two minutes. It won’t start another cycle until the first one is done.” Delving beneath the surface of such everyday mechanics is part and parcel for the Robbo team. Whilst its roots stretch back to the dawn of the century, it was in 2012 that the company began training its focus on robotic devices and tutorial materials to meet the needs of the current age. “Our world is built on technologies,” explains Karkkonen. “Most of the appliances at home are robots, like the microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and toothbrush. We are surrounded by these technologies, but only a few people know how they work.” Thanks to Robbo’s pedagogically designed tools, users are now able to develop relevant problem-solving skills as they explore life from a programming perspective. Helping to untangle the coding process, two different types of Robbo are currently available: ‘laboratory’ and ‘robot kit’ (pictured). Helping to untangle the coding process, two different types of Robbo are currently available: ‘laboratory’ and ‘robot kit’. The former is self contained, with the latter more adjustable, allowing the user to build their own robot with sensors. “Components in both products are programmable,” Karkkonen states. “They start working with a piece of code that you come up with yourself. It’s based on open source technologies.” Robbo has developed the robots together with the University of Helsinki’s Department of Teacher Education, as well as schools in Finland. This collaboration is a timely effort, as coding is set to become part of the Finnish primary school curriculum this coming autumn. “Finland understands that this is the real skill that children will need in future,” Karkkonen says. “Personally, I haven’t been using things like algebra in real life since I finished school. But with programming, you can apply it right away.” Combining Finnish tech and education in such a way is just the beginning for the company, which was originally founded in Russia, and currently has an office in Helsinki. “We have two lines of development,” Karkkonen says. “One is programming and the other is engineering. As soon as kids have enough knowledge of physics, they can start building for themselves. Children are intuitive; they have their own logic that works quickly and don’t need guidance.” Having been anchored by angel investor funding up until this point, Robbo is looking to open an investment round in the near future to enable further growth. “Next year we are expanding to more European countries,” Karkkonen says. “Now, we have 60 per cent of our sales from Finland, and 40 per cent from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the US.” Finally, if all of this technology talk has piqued your curiosity, but you find yourself more young at heart than young at age, Karkkonen is keen to emphasise that Robbo is intended for all. “We are designed for children between the ages of six to 99,” she says with a smile."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-project-shapes-schools-of-tomorrow/,Finnish project shapes schools of tomorrow,"Schools are a fundamental building block in our society, but they can struggle to keep up with the fast changing world around them. A new project in Finland, a country that is renowned for its education system, has set out to find out how schools can stay relevant and exciting for the next 100 years. “  is part of a celebration programme for Finland’s centenary of independence in 2017 and one the biggest projects focused on Finnish basic education,” says  , head of operations at  , the educational company running the non-profit project. “It examines what the world’s best education should be like in 100 years’ time.” The Hundred team taps into both Finnish and international expertise to answer this question. They will interview 100 changemakers in education, create case studies of the 100 best education projects around the world and trial 100 Finnish education innovations in schools across the country. “When the world is changing fast, schools need to be able to change with it and preferably do so proactively,” Leponiemi explains. “But very often in education development people only look at what they are doing themselves. We want to invest heavily to going into the world and learn together how we can reform education towards a better direction.” “The best educational practices aren’t always found in expensive private schools or the ones with biggest resources, you learn by looking elsewhere,” says Lasse Leponiemi. The biggest push in Hundred is real-world testing of new education methods in hundreds of Finnish schools. During 2016 and 2017 these projects, selected from over 500 applications and developed by Finnish teachers, explore how children could be best provided with the tools they need in the future. The projects focus on five key areas in education: skills, teaching, assessment, learning environment and management, but each takes a very different approach. They vary from building a startup high school to organising the world’s largest parent-teacher night. One family will even sail around the world to research the use of digital tools and new ways to learn in a homeschool environment. Another project, led by   nominee  , experiments with more functional, project-based and student-centric learning methods to make maths more fun and engaging. Rossi sees Hundred as a great way to focus attention on the need for change in education. “The teaching of maths has not really been reformed in the past 100 years,” Rossi argues. “It is one of the most hated subjects, but one that is very important and gives great basis for different life skills. I want to move from a teacher centric to a student centric approach. Also the content needs to be more meaningful and relevant to the kids. Not just numbers and formulas.” All the projects are chosen by an advisory board and supported by Hundred’s main partners, the Federation of Finnish Technology Industries, Finnish telecom operator DNA, OP Financial Group and Finland-based mobile gaming giant Supercell. The goal of Hundred is not only to gain knowledge and experiences, but to inspire educational change. All the project findings will be collected into what Leponiemi describes as ‘the world’s largest education database’. It will be free for teachers and educators worldwide to use and find ways to transform education in their own schools. The project findings will also be documented in a book, several short documentaries and a series of seminars. While these are not scheduled to launch until late 2017, Leponiemi already has ideas where the education sector is heading. “I believe education will go through a similar transformation to many industries,” he says. “It will become more transparent and global. This can already be seen in higher education where there are iTunes universities and such, which anyone can use access for free. The world of education will open up internationally in a completely new way. “ And Hundred aims to ensure Finland’s future is at the forefront of it. The findings from global case studies, trial projects in Finland and interviews with leaders in education will be turned into a free database open to teachers and educators worldwide."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sparta-secures-successful-future/,Sparta secures a successful future,"After initially focusing solely on information management, this Finnish company now gets to the source for cyber security. Thanks in part to the 2006 hit film  , these days the word Sparta conjures up images of scantily clad warriors, armed with sculpted abs and a shouty disposition. Needless to say, Finnish company   is seeking to create an altogether different impression. Unconcerned with butting heads with Persian foes or being trampled by oversized elephants, there is a significantly more modern enemy to tackle circa 2016: “Our fight is with the major ICT and consultancy corporates; a battle of ethics, of proving that ultimate customer satisfaction is good business,” explains  , the company’s founder and chairman of the board. “Unlike the Spartans, we’ll prevail in the end, and not just provide a heroic battle for the history pages.” First starting out in 2012 as information management consultants, Sparta soon cottoned on to the fact that the upkeep of data quality is quite a powerful thing when combined with cyber security. Indeed, with the global cyber security market tipped to reach 101 billion US dollars by 2018, a slight shift in focus has seen Sparta entering a land of opportunities. “We still have our consultation business on the information management side,” Antikainen states. “But more and more we are transforming into an information security and cybersecurity company, with a twist of information management.” “Our mission is to ensure that public and private institutions, as well as nation states, can trust the information that they operate with,” explains Jani Antikainen. The company’s background gives it a unique leg up in the cyber security domain. Sparta first ensures that the data being protected has a relevant business function and meaning that reflects reality. This is needed to counter information sabotage, the next push of ill will for the cyber security envelope. “We build trust in information,” Antikainen says. “It makes sense to ensure it isn’t tampered with before it is transmitted somewhere.” Furthermore, whilst many cyber security companies harness firewalls to protect against outside threats such as hackers and malware, Sparta is also alert to the dangers lurking within. “It could be like in the case of United States Office of Personnel Management, where there actually was an insider already in the company who copied 22 million personal records,” Antikainen explains. “Much confidential and security classified data was copied and taken away.” Whilst considerable interest in Sparta has come from the finance and energy sector, Antikainen also points to military threats and terrorists harnessing IT attacks as other information sabotage concerns countered by Sparta. “Top US intelligence officers are underlining time after time that the threats to information trustworthiness are the cyber risks they are most worried about,” Antikainen says. “Our mission is to ensure that public and private institutions, as well as nation states, can trust the information that they operate with.” Having raised some 750 000 euros in funding, Sparta is backed by an advisory board that includes  , the founder of cyber security company Codenomicon, which was sold to Synopsys in the US last year. Sparta currently has three ongoing pilots and is launching its first product in Finland in early autumn. The international market is also beckoning as the year draws to a close. “We need a better world and world peace,” Antikainen confirms. “We are working on that, doing our best. We have something very innovative; there’s definitely huge potential here.” The global cyber security market has tipped to reach 101 billion US dollars by 2018."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/fibion-takes-stand-sitting/,Fibion takes a stand against sitting,"These days there are a multitude of gadgets on hand that measure everything from the steps you take to the time spent exercising. But, how about seemingly insignificant daily activities such as sitting or standing? Think about the comfiest seat you know. It may be the sofa, your office chair, or even the swing seat outdoors that forms the focal point of your summer. Altogether, how much of your day would you spend sitting down? Well, the reality may surprise you. According to  , partner and PhD (Sports and Health) at  , the average amount per person is around 10-11 hours every day. “In developed countries, millions of people are suffering from a sedentary lifestyle, obesity and resulting health problems,” Tikkanen explains. “Sitting is associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and even premature mortality.” In fact, such inactivity has swiftly become the fourth leading cause of premature death in the West. Finnish company Fibion is seeking to make a difference, with its Fibion Analysis solution measuring and assessing people’s physical activity routines throughout the whole day – regardless of whether they are on foot or on tail. Designed to support the work of health and fitness professionals, the Fibion measurement device fits easily in the pocket. The reasoning behind this is not only convenience, but also practicality. By resting next to the thigh, Fibion can accurately detect the full spectrum of physical activity, including any previously untraceable time spent sitting and standing. Designed to support the work of health and fitness professionals, the Fibion measurement device fits easily in the pocket. Needless to say this gives it a significant competitive edge over wrist-worn devices, which are limited in their scope when recognising such things as cycling or utilising a standing desk at work. The resultant data is accumulated during waking hours over seven days, helping determine whether the person meets sitting time recommendations and how well they can interrupt harmful long-term habits. Relevant professionals can then provide evidence-based advice to change the person’s lifestyle towards the direction that also encompasses healthy sitting. “Fibion visualises how sitting and physical activity are in balance for health benefits in a form of a balance board,” Tikkanen states. “It also includes a goal-setting tool. The underlying algorithms are based on hundreds of research papers.” The Fibion story stretches back to the formation of a research group at the University of Jyväskylä’s Department of Biology of Physical Activity in 2009. An active member of this collective, Tikkanen would go on to become the world’s first PhD studying the health impacts of everyday activity using long-term electromyography studies. As the research group gathered momentum over the years, eventually it was decided to spin a company out of its findings in 2014. Together, Tikkanen and fellow researcher   teamed up with  ’s information technology know-how and Fibion was born. Releasing its landmark product onto the market earlier this year, the company has already attracted considerable attention in the short time since. “The Aava Medical Centre, a leading medical service provider in Finland, is using Fibion in their type 2 diabetes prevention programmes,” Tikkanen says. “Also, Cambridge Weight Plan has taken Fibion into use, to help customers on their weight loss journey.” Fibion’s global impact is set to increase further in future, after recently being accepted to the Amazon Launchpad programme, which seeks to give startups a successful boost. Thanks to this Fibion will soon be reaching fresh markets in several new languages. Also refraining from resting on its laurels is Fibion’s R&D, with future scientific discoveries to be incorporated into Fibion Analysis. Looking ahead, an online service is also being rolled out later this year, facilitating customer management and group reports with ease. All of this current ‘get up and go’ for Fibion mirrors that of the company’s hopes for its end customers. “From an individual’s point of view, already standing up from the chair regularly helps in losing weight and keeping blood sugar levels stable, and thus improves mood, vigour and concentration,” Tikkanen says. “From a behavioural point of view, it is important to show people how small things matter for their health.” Fibion visualises how sitting and physical activity are in balance for health benefits in a form of a balance board. The board also includes a goal-setting tool."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/futurefly-visualises-a-new-approach-to-messaging/,Futurefly visualises a new approach to messaging,"By enabling the use of personalised avatars, Rawr Messenger unlocks a treasure trove of emotions to help enrich communication. With Rawr messenger app users can create their own 3D avatar, using editable body and face shapes, hair styles and skin tones. The lion’s share of university graduates would be satisfied if their first job after completing their studies was not only a great place to work, but also paid a tidy sum. As icing on the cake, how about a brand new Audi A4 – replaceable every six months – thrown in for good measure? So, just why did   turn his back on Microsoft after 3.5 years working there, exactly? “I felt that if I stay at this company any longer I’m going to become complacent and be there for the rest of my life,” he recalls. “I was at a junction of everything that most people would want, but I realised I wasn’t learning anything new anymore.” Häkkinen bravely jumped ship, joining Electronic Arts before finding himself at  ,   and   developer Remedy Entertainment. It was here whilst researching the challenges with acquiring users in free-to-play games that his gaze fell upon messaging. Surveying the success enjoyed by the likes of Snapchat, Wechat, Line Messenger and Whatsapp, he came to a quick realisation. “All of these brought something new to the messaging space that hadn’t been seen before,” Häkkinen recalls. “But, when I looked at the innovation of the chat experience in recent years, there is emoji, then animated emoji, then stickers, then gifs. That’s the limit of expression available.” But, as Häkkinen increasingly pondered, could the introduction of 3D characters successfully break down the walls of self-expression in the messaging space? A team was swiftly assembled in 2014 with backgrounds at Habbo Hotel, Sulake, User Intelligence, Grey Area and Rovio, prepping a demo together in their spare time. The end result caught the attention of US investors, closing a 500 000 euro funding round by year’s end. In quick succession, day jobs were quit,   was founded, and a further   in capital was rustled up last summer. After some final tweaks were made, the fruit of their labour has now been unleashed on the public. In short, Rawr Messenger takes everything that’s familiar about messaging and gives it a nudge into the unknown. “First you create your own 3D avatar, using editable body and face shapes, hair styles and skin tones,” Häkkinen explains. “I think it’s fair to say that it’s the most advanced avatar creator available on mobile. After you’ve created yourself, you go to the wardrobe and dress up. There are plenty of clothing items and also extras, like boxing gloves and headphones. When you change these, your look registers instantaneously across all your chats.” You can dress up your avatar in Rawr messenger app and add even boxing gloves or headphones to perfect your look. Alongside hosting standard chat features like photos and sharing video, Rawr Messenger has many other unique and customisable features, such as changing chat backgrounds and adding weather elements. Each avatar also has no shortage of animations on offer. Häkkinen punches in a handful of hashtags to a chat to demonstrate, and his avatar begins to dance, switches to playing basketball and finishes up by wolfing down a few emoji burgers. “We’ve also tagged all emojis, so each of them is going to do something,” the company CPO enthuses. “See, simply by adding a bunch of emoji now I’m waving a Finnish flag, blowing a kiss, drinking champagne and putting a crown on my head.” Whilst all of this is undeniably entertaining from a user standpoint, how exactly is Futurefly set to generate revenue, given that the app is free to both download and use? The quick answer is in-app purchases. Though, parents needn’t fret, snapping up new clothes and accessories from the Rawr shops isn’t likely to result in a shocking credit card bill at the end of the month. By way of example, Häkkinen selects a new shirt, with the price tag translating to 20 cents (approximately 22 US cents). Response to Rawr thus far has been positive. It has gained traction in the US and UK and during its first weekend alone some 1.2 million chats were held via the app’s chat function. Known as Globe Trotter, this space offers a modern-day spin on pen pals by connecting random users worldwide. Looking ahead, with the team now hard at work on the Android version, there is still much innovation to come. Mini-games are on the Rawr roadmap in the not too distant future, such as rock-paper-scissors and flipping dice with your friends. “We fill a void, I believe, bringing a deeper level of expression to chat,” Häkkinen says. “Whether we can break habits, however, remains to be seen.” “We’ve also tagged all emojis, so each of them is going to do something,” enthuses Oskari “Ozz” Häkkinen, CPO and founder of Futurefly. “See, simply by adding a bunch of emoji now I’m waving a Finnish flag, blowing a kiss, drinking champagne and putting a crown on my head.”"

The key to its success? People. “It is all about the team,” Alapaattikoski says. “Success is not built by the management alone. We have a great team that strongly believes in working together towards common goals. Our management has not been raised onto a pedestal.” It is also from working together that Anders’ latest venture stems from. Two years ago the company saw a need for scalable online store platforms and a year later its open source e-commerce product ‘Shoop’ was born. Shoop makes it easy to build online stores of all sizes and offers integrations with most major e-commerce players, such as Amazon and Ebay. Crucially, the platform is free to use as its revenue comes from a partner network offering additional services, including marketing and resource management. “This is an unique model, a free platform for online stores,” Alapaattikoski explains. “This would not have been possible a few years ago, because e-commerce platforms tried to do everything themselves. We offer the core functionalities in the best possible way and all additional features come from our partners through integrations.” “You need to research the competition and see what works in the US. In Europe, and in Finland particularly, we have used to very different style of marketing,” says Tomi Alapaattikoski, CEO of Anders Innovations. To separate the product from the consulting business, Shoop was first launched as a spin-off company in the US. In year one Shoop attracted over 2000 customers and localised for Finnish, North and South American markets. Next year the company plans to expand to Asia, where Anders already has operations. And this is just the start. “The goal for Shoop is to become the world’s most used online store platform by 2020,” Alapaattikoski says. “For Anders the aim is to gain more customers internationally and become a stock listed company within the next three years.” Alapaattikoski stresses entering the US market is not easy and he has a few tips to share. First is to have a local presence. Alapaattikoski himself moved to California last year to set up Shoop, which now employs 11 people locally. “People here like to buy from American companies or at least you need to have local references,” he explains. “When you get the first major reference, you have been accepted. You need to be able to show you are here to stay, not just visiting. You cannot do that properly if you are flying back and forth between countries.” Secondly Alapaattikoski highlights the importance of personal relationships. You need to be ready to speak with everybody and follow up on all leads. “[The US] has 350 million people interested in new things, but it is also one the world’s most demanding markets. You need to be prepared to work hard to stand out,” Alapaattikoski concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/trip-republic-makes-travel-personal/,Trip Republic makes travel more personal,"These days, organising a journey abroad yourself is more possible than ever before. Now it’s time to cut down the time it takes to do so. Traditionally, the travel experience is seen as everything that happens to occur between the moments of departure and return. Whilst here resides the lion’s share of sun-kissed memories, monumental photo ops and tacky souvenir accumulation, for many the time spent organising beforehand also forms a big part of the adventure. “You spend a lot of time thinking about the trip before you leave and planning it,” states   CEO  . “It’s part of the inspirational stage and gives huge value. One of the high points is anticipating something fun, which is as fun as the fun part itself.” Nonetheless, while the Internet may have freed up the possibility of do-it-yourself trip planning, this can often be a time consuming affair spent juggling between different websites. “I don’t see the limited search options that we currently have as really working,” Schauman continues. “I think this is a legacy from travel agents. Now everything is online, so you don’t have an agent, but you are still searching the Pegasus/Remedy database.” One-stop social travel planner and booking tool Trip Republic aims to remedy this by creating seamless travel experiences across transport, accommodation, sightseeing and activities. The social nature of Trip Republic also facilitates easy organisation and communication of group travel. “We have integrated a lot of travel supply which wasn’t possible five years ago,” Schauman says. “The whole idea is that travel should become more personal. You should be able to make sure that every traveller gets the right kind of information in front of them.” And so, once users have created a Trip Republic profile, the service tracks their moves on the site in order to tailor future searches according to their preferences. “Say someone is interested in going to Paris,” Schauman explains. “If they want a romantic experience, with a three-star hotel and some hipster stuff, we can also recommend going to this museum, and checking out that particular restaurant.” Trip Republic’s roots can be traced to Friday Flats, the vacation rentals service that was snapped up earlier this year by Finnish serviced apartments provider Forenom. Once the deal was closed, the six-person team based in Helsinki and Tallinn immediately turned their focus to Trip Republic. Propped up by a 200 000-euro seed investment from business angels, the free-to-use service has been continuously adding to its list of sports events, hotels, flights, transport, museums, tours and restaurants around the world. An app is also about to be launched, meaning added convenience is soon at hand. One frustrating thing about travel is that try as you may, in time many details of your trip will eventually fade from memory. Not so with Trip Republic. The service acts as a concrete memoir of every journey that users take, down to the very last detail planned online. Being as the Trip Republic’s focus is also social, alongside facilitating easy organisation of group travel, these memories are also shared by all of the participants of the trip. “Members communicating with each other is where we are seeing the most interest,” Schauman states. “It’s seen as an efficiency tool, as you can invite people to contribute when planning.” This personal touch is just the beginning. Looking to the horizon, Schauman believes that the next 10 years in travel will see huge changes. “We are entering a new period where we see the pace getting a lot faster,” Schauman says. “It’s all about getting the right suggestions to the right people.” Trip Republic, it seems, is planning to be right smack in the middle of this. Trip Republic’s team based in Helsinki and Tallinn has been propped up by a 200 000-euro seed investment from business angels."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-democratises-wealth-management-with-automation/,Finnish startup democratises wealth management with automation,"How do you feel about receiving financial advice from a machine? Finns are about to find out as Helsinki-based startup Evervest will launch the country’s first fully automated wealth management service. Wealth management has traditionally been built around strong personal relationships, but not for long if you ask  . The year old startup is on the frontline to bring an era of fully digital ‘robo advisors’ to Europe. “We want to democratise wealth management, which previously has been available mainly for the very wealthy,” says  , co-founder and CEO of Evervest. “Evervest is a next-generation digital, automated wealth management platform.” Instead of a Terminator-type robot, Evervest’s robo advisor is intelligent software that automatically invests, tracks the market and rebalances investments based on their customers’ goals. When a new user signs up for the online service, they answer various questions on their background, investments goals and attitude towards risk. Evervest’s proprietary software then tailors a portfolio suggestion to match the user’s profile and, if the customer gives the go-ahead, completes the investments and monitors the portfolio. This represents a new age in financial services. Customers get 24/7 access to their robo advisor and transparent view to their portfolio. For Evervest it is all about making investing more accessible and affordable for everybody, even those without any previous investment experience. “We have focused strongly on making a service that is really easy to approach and use,” says Jussi Kallasvuo. However, Evervest is not completely without a human touch. The backbone of the software is data provided by Kallasvuo and his two co-founders  and . The trio have put their financial industry and management consulting backgrounds to use in building risk profiles, choosing investment instruments and models and making sure Evervest really understands its customers. “It is a complete turnkey solution,” says Kallasvuo. ”The customer can focus on living their life and leave worrying about investments to us. Our job is to understand the customer’s background and goals as well as possible.” If a user adjusts their risk profile or investment goals, their portfolio is changed accordingly. The key for Evervest is transparency and this applies to its revenue model as well. Unlike often in traditional wealth management, the company does not have separate transaction or banking fees nor does it receive any kickbacks for recommending a specific financial product. “We choose the best possible products for each case and take a very transparent procentual [management] fee,” says Kallasvuo. The cost of the automated service is up to a one per cent of the value of the portfolio, which covers all expenses. Robo advisors are fast gaining traction in the US but Evervest is among the first companies in Europe (and the first in Finland) to tap into this fledgling market. Kallasvuo believes demand for more digital and automated services will grow rapidly. “There are three major factors driving the change,” he explains. “Consumers want to use these kinds of easy-to-use services, there is a need for improved cost-efficiency in the industry and digital advisors are easy to control, which fits well with tightening regulation.“ Evervest is confident its focus on building a service that is both simple to use and accessible to all gives it an upper hand compared to competitors. Furthermore the ambitious startup, whose platform will soon be launched, already has European expansion in mind. “Our goal is to be an international player,” says Kallasvuo. “We will first build a great service here and then take it abroad. We will have to see what the exact timetable is, but if we are not operating in at least one other market by the end of next year, we will be disappointed.” “We were frustrated with some of the current practices in wealth management and wanted to build a service we would like to use ourselves,” says Jussi Kallasvuo, Evervest CEO."

Now Finnish event Ultrahack is taking the concept a step further with a hackathon tournament focused on creating new social and economic innovations. “Ultrahack is a combination of hackathons, accelerator services and an open innovation platform,” says Mikko Järvilehto, co-founder and CEO of Ultrahack. In Ultrahack there’s even a chance to build a drone using a 3D printer and take part in a drone racing event. Last year around 50 per cent of all Ultrahack participants were Finnish, but the event is expected to attract an even wider international crowd this time. The goal is to eventually build a European league of hackathons."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-colouring-book-app-for-adults-storms-the-market/,Finnish colouring book app for adults storms the market,"Colouring books for adults have become a huge hit, but you do not need pens and paper to enjoy the experience. Finnish startup Sumoing has brought the same immersive experience to mobile. Over nine million downloads, one million new users every month and a steady place among the top ten entertainment apps in the US. The success of the ‘Recolor’ colouring book app since its launch one year ago has taken even its creator   by surprise. “We have done quite a few creative apps prior to this and it has been a surprise how massively big audience love colouring,” says  , Sumoing co-founder and CEO. “And we are only getting started. We have focused on iOS so far and just started on Android. What makes colouring on a mobile app so appealing? A key factor is its ease of use. You can choose a picture from over 900 illustrations, pick a colour and just tap the area where you want it to be applied. Naturally it is a different feel from pen and paper, but Teppo says the digital world also expands the experience. Colours can have animated effects and pictures can come in 3D. “Colouring fits how people use their mobile phones very well,” Teppo describes. “You colour for a moment when waiting for the bus and continue when you have another free moment. The experience is similar to gaming. It is entertainment, but with a more creative touch. It is not about competition, but creativity and relaxation.” “With a colouring app everybody can get a feeling that ‘Hey this looks really good, I did this’. Mass market appeal requires that sense of achievement,” says Sumoing CEO Ilkka Teppo. Recolor has found its audience particularly among 18 to 44 year old women in the US and UK. It is far from the only colouring app targeting this market, but Recolor stands out with its focus on variety. “We want to offer something for everyone, no matter if you are a child or a grandparent, whether you like cats or mandalas,” Teppo explains. “There are no limits for content in the digital world. If a CD fits twelve tracks and Spotify has two million tracks, then our goal is to be the latter one.” While a selection of the illustrations are free to use, access to the whole library requires a subscription fee. At the moment most of the pictures are sourced by Sumoing, but the goal is to open up the service to all aspiring illustrators to upload their pictures for others to use. Teppo expects to reach 10 000 pictures by the end of 2016. While Recolor is in the league of its own, it is not Sumoing’s first dabble with success. Since the company was founded in 2012 it has launched four photography apps and gathered a total of 25 million downloads. Most of users have come from the US, which is not an easy feat for an eight person startup based in Finland. Teppo does not have a simple recipe for how to make it across the Atlantic, but he believes geographic distance is not an issue. “We use Apple and Google stores for distribution so we don’t have to worry about distribution channels,” Teppo explains. “We don’t need face-to-face selling, but reach consumers organically and through digital marketing channels.” Sumoing has started to eye wider markets, but for now its focus is on app development. The plan is to expand Recolor into a fully-flexed platform where users can upload illustrations, turn their photos into colouring pictures, share their creations and interact with others. “We are nowhere close to being ready, but we have a clear vision for where we are headed. There is no global digital colouring brand yet, no ‘Spotify of colouring’ and that is what we want to become,” Teppo concludes. Sumoing wants Recolor to become the ‘Spotify of colouring books’ with millions of illustrations. The next step is to build the app into a platform where people can add and share their own creations and interact with others."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pole-bicycle-company-roll/,Pole Bicycle Company is on a roll,"This Finnish high-end bicycle producer boasts a growing range of two wheelers, which go to great lengths to provide a superior experience. Ever since he can remember, biking was all about freedom for  . “When I was a kid, my bike took me places,” he recalls. “You can jump, have wind blowing through your hair and everything like that. When you grow older some people might think it’s kid’s play. But for me, I still escape on my bike from all life’s worries and stress.” Kokkonen decided it was time to share this sensation a few years ago. A professional downhill biker himself, he teamed up with logistics engineer   “to design high quality bicycles for all cycles of life.” Embracing the Finnish word for ‘pedal!’ as its name,   has been based in their hometown of Jyväskylä since 2013. And power forward they have. The company has since released over 15 models of bikes, with tweaks in design that accommodate cross-country, trail, enduro, downhill and urban. “When it’s my own designed bike, that feels really good,” states company co-founder Leo Kokkonen. “Everything is as I want it to be.” Now, the rule of thumb is that if an innovation is truly progressive, it will swiftly agitate opposing opinions. Such has been the response for Pole Bicycle Company. On one side people have raised an eyebrow at its range of long and slack two-wheelers. On the other, glowing reviews from the likes of UK website Bike Radar, have lauded ‘ ’. Certainly, the booming wheelbase measurement of 51.7 inches (1 312 mm) dominates first impressions of Pole’s Evolink 140. Closer inspection reveals it’s not only a stylistic choice, however. Having also founded a successful industrial design company a decade ago, Kokkonen’s patent pending suspension design is a prominent feature of Pole’s bikes. “We test everything and try to be scientific with product design,” Kokkonen admits. “We are also thinking differently and openly; we have not founded the company based on secrets or a simple-minded stubborn way to think.” Alongside making good business, the company’s motto is to produce safe, effective and easy bikes. And let’s not forget about convenience, with Pole’s Evolkink downhill, cross-country and enduro bikes easily foldable. Whilst everything is currently rolling very nicely indeed for Pole, Kokkonen is keeping an open mind about potential developments down the path. “I would like to try electric assistance,” he admits. “You can go anywhere you want with an e-bike. But, the technology is still a bit debatable for my ideology. If we can find a good motor that suits our bikes, we can definitely try it out.” Not so fast, though – Pole Bicycle Company’s four-person crew is currently finding ways to keep up with surging demand for their pedal-powered offering. “We run out of stock quite often,” Kokkonen says. “People are looking for higher quality from us. As our new evolving bikes get really good reviews from reporters, they are almost sold out.” Thus, having initially bootstrapped, the company has recently launched a second round of crowdfunding to help alleviate the situation. “The problem is we don’t have enough funds to produce enough bikes,” Kokkonen admits. “We could sell loads more than we can currently produce.” And so, as they continue to gear up in future, the company’s approach is set to remain the same: creating bikes that they would like to ride themselves. “When it’s my own designed bike, that feels really good,” Kokkonen reflects. “Everything is as I want it to be.” Alongside making good business, Pole’s motto is to produce safe, effective and easy bikes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/talentadore-humanises-job-hunt/,TalentAdore humanises the job hunt,"In contrast to the radio silence that so often permeates the recruitment process, this space can now be filled with communication and personal feedback. A job search has a typical order of events. After finding a suitable vacancy, you spend hours tweaking your resume and sculpting a cover letter just so, in order to maximise your impact. Then, once it is polished and ready, you finally submit it in a giddy mix of nervousness, excitement and hope. Impatiently, you wait for a response. And wait. And then, quite often… nothing. “Recruiting is full of crazy customs and takes hours of your time,” states  , CTO of  . “It’s pretty inefficient and we want to fix that.” Thanks to this Finnish solution, if 100 people apply for a job, 99 will no longer be left in the dark when that one person is successful. “The key feature we have is that, as a candidate, you can get feedback about what is good in your application, or the areas you need to develop in order to be relevant in this job in future,” Latvala says. “There will also be automatic status updates in the next version of our product, so you will always know how the recruitment process is going.” TalentAdore’s solution relies on neural network technology-based algorithms that generate clear and fully personalised feedback. “We are making recruitment more human by using natural language processing,” explains company CEO  . “That’s why we say we are bringing the human touch back into recruitment.” TalentAdore’s logo shows they have their heart in the game. Whilst TalentAdore’s appeal is obvious for candidates, the service also brings significant value to the other side of the fence. “We believe that if we serve the needs of the candidate, then that’s the best way to serve the needs of the employers,” Valkama continues. “Candidates are customers – if you don’t treat them well they stop buying your products.” What’s more, these alienated applicants could very well then also spread the negative word of their experience to others. “Many companies today put customers at the centre of their business, saying, ‘the customer is king’,” Valkama continues. “But, if candidates are also customers, why do they treat them this way?” Well, perhaps the chief culprit is lack of time. Thus, TalentAdore’s patented technology drastically reduces how long it takes employers to process significant numbers of applications – from hours to minutes. After closing a 700 000-euro funding round in the spring, the company is now readying itself for its next great push. “We now have the service available in Finnish and English,” Valkama says. “But, if we can make an algorithm for these languages, we can make it in others as well. We are aiming for really strong, rapid growth and going where the need is greatest.” Talking with the TalentAdore duo, it is abundantly clear how passionate they are about trying to make a difference. It could even be said that they wear their heart on their sleeve at times. However, upon closer inspection, TalentAdore’s logo actually reveals its true location: a heart is symbolically connected to the company name. “When we call customer service somewhere and their answer is ‘I don’t know, I’m just working here’, this kind of treatment means that the employee doesn’t have their heart in the game,” Valkama observes. “But, every person can find their dream job.” With this in mind, it’s fair to say then that TalentAdore’s heart is definitely in the right place. “We are making recruitment more human by using natural language processing,” states company CEO Saku Valkama."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jongla-merger-social-networks-instant-messaging/,Jongla makes instant messaging more social,"Social networks and instant messaging used to be very different services. One Finnish company is helping those two phenomena join into something new. Finns know a thing or two about messaging. They created Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and were the prime developers of Short Message Service (SMS). But now the Finnish company   thinks it is time for yet another evolutionary leap. “Our mission is to shake up the world of instant messengers,” proclaims Jongla’s CEO  . Salminen and his cofounder   started working on their idea in 2009, back when Symbian remained the main operating system for Nokia’s mobile phones. They knew SMS and MMS messages were limited and expensive in the new age of smartphones and wanted to improve the service. “Instant messaging started off as a cheaper and more convenient replacement of MMS and SMS,” Salminen explains. “That basically meant sending text, emojis and images to the closest people in your life.” But don’t think Jongla is just a messaging service. Salminen says that social media gives you the ability to create and share content, as well as build and be part of larger social networks. What if you could merge the two into something new and better? “What we mean by blurring the lines between social networking and messaging apps is that social features are becoming part of instant messaging,” Salminen continues. “These features are large networks of people, profiles, status updates, events, interest groups, rich content sharing, making friends, dating and even customer service.” Jongla already has a host of features which sets them apart from the crowded messaging market. The community named “People” helps users find and meet others nearby. “Reactions” are ways to express emotions, like smiles, thumbs-up or hearts. “Disruption and innovation is at the heart of Jongla,” states Jongla’s CEO Riku Salminen. Users can also record a voice message and add filters to the sound. “Jongla Out” allows a user to chat with someone regardless of their messaging platform. Another important feature is how little data it uses. According to internal studies Jongla uses 80 per cent less data than Viber and 25 per cent less than Facebook Messenger. It also takes less space to download and install compared to major competitors. This is particularly important for the users in their main markets. “Since the early days of Jongla we have seen strongest organic growth in Southeast Asia, especially in  , Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia,” Salminen says. “Now we are seeing growth all over the globe, but due to our strategy the strongest response is coming from emerging markets.” Jongla continues to develop their offering by adding new social features. In the coming months they are planning to add a layer of gamification to make it more fun, and they are also studying data-efficient calls. Yet their long-term plans are even bigger. “Our plan is to become a ‘Platform of Things’, to go beyond messaging and become a platform that features new services,” Salminen concludes. “We want to keep on disrupting the market with new innovations which will make messaging possible for the next billion people around the world who will be connecting to the Internet for the first time with a personal device. “Disruption and innovation is at the heart of Jongla.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cleantech-challenges-solved/,Cleantech challenges are Solved,"As the rapidly developing world is met with a growing number of environmental red flags, this Finnish solution is bringing relevant experts closer together.  The abundance of trees in Finland has ensured that forestry has remained the local economy’s chief focus for centuries. Now, as digitalisation depletes demand for paper, a recent   suggests that clean technology, or cleantech, has taken the mantle of Finland’s biggest industry. “When you look at the big trends in the world, such as urbanisation and climate change, these challenges are very complex,” explains  , executive vice president of advisory service and digital collaboration platform  . “Cleantech is a big market opportunity when it comes to energy, water, waste and mobility. You need a systemic approach to deal with these complex challenges.” Solved meets them head-on, by connecting customers and their stakeholders with a global network of over 1 500 leading multi-disciplinary sustainability experts. “In order to tackle the issues in an optimal way you need to access the best people and talent around the world and bring them quickly together,” Hulkkonen continues. “We have built a big expert network and have a collaborative platform which enables our clients to get the best possible team across company borders.” Initially launched as  ’s online service in 2012, Solved was founded as a standalone company the following year by Hulkkonen, CEO   and vice president  . Currently with offices in Helsinki, Bratislava and Oulu, the 10-person team has already overseen more than 60 projects, predominantly in Europe. Solved was founded by (left to right) Santtu Hulkkonen, Janne Hietaniemi and Radoslav Mizera. “The three key areas we focus on are cities, industries and resorts,” Hulkkonen states. “Of these, the main customer group at the moment are cities. These include projects connected to urban planning, such as sustainable city districts, energy systems and real estate developments.” The one common thread between these is that the Internet’s lack of geographic discrimination means there are no longer boundaries to acquiring suitable expertise. “Even as a city major or economic or environment director of small city, you have access to the best possible knowhow in the world at your fingertips,” Hulkkonen says. “They work for you in a very modern, efficient way. It is very exciting; almost too good to be true.” Elsewhere, besides smart city solutions, some of the environmental, energy and industrial challenges solved by Solved include co-creating bioeconomy- and circular economy-based business concepts and sustainable ski resorts. The Solved platform is based on design methodology developed at Stanford University, which has been digitalised. The business model emphasises that users should also establish their own projects and tap into the expert network. Thus, in the midst of Solved’s scaling up and increased self-containment, this in turn diminishes the necessary involvement of its core team. “As more and more projects are generated by experts in the network, the platform enables growth with no boundaries,” Hulkkonen underlines. The company is thus on the cusp of bigger things. Much, much bigger. Whilst Solved is set to post one million euros in revenue this year, its projected turnover for 2020 is 100 million euros. “A bigger investment round will take place in 2017 from the US and Asia,” Hulkkonen states. “Our scalability is developing nicely, and we are very confident about the situation in future.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/high-speed-rail-transportation-vacuum-tubes/,Finland primed for world’s first Hyperloop transportation,"Hyperloop, a high-speed rail transportation system based on vacuum tubes, has raised interest all over the world for its efficiency and sustainability. But it is the Finnish city of Salo which could be home to the first station for this super-fast technology. Imagine travelling between Helsinki, Finland and Stockholm, Sweden in just 28 minutes instead of a one-hour flight plus waiting at airports. This bold vision may become reality thanks to a proposed Hyperloop link between the two capital cities which is estimated to bring annual savings of 321 million euros from the reduced travel time. These are the results of the world’s first pre-feasibility study of a full-scale Hyperloop system produced by US-based technology specialist Hyperloop One, consultants KPMG and Finnish company  . FS Links was founded a year ago to facilitate the building of a fixed link between the two Nordic countries. “Hyperloop One is currently looking for a ‘proof of operations’ facility, so a research centre and rails, and they have already decided it will be in Europe,” says  , partner at FS Links. “Many places are competing for it, but Finland has the lead as a we have made the first actual business case and are also the first company Hyperloop has invested in.” Key to these plans is the Finnish city of Salo. The city, located 115 kilometres from Helsinki, has signed a ‘letter of intent’ with Hyperloop One to become the first test station along the proposed Helsinki-Stockholm route. Salo officials believe the super-fast connection would be a great opportunity for growth and new jobs in the high-tech city. “As a city planner I believe the impact of this kind of a new system will be so huge you do not want to miss being in the front row,” explains  , city architect at Salo. “If it happens, it will change the nature of living in the Nordic region.” The basic idea of Hyperloop technology is to transport passengers and goods in levitating pods which travel up to 1 200 kilometres per hour inside a tube with close to zero air pressure. Tunnel vision: Helsinki to Stockholm in under 30 minutes. While this may sound like science fiction and questions still remain about the system’s viability, Fröjdö and Heimo are both confident the technology can work. “None of the key technologies are novelties by themselves,” Fröjdö argues. “Tubes, magnetic levitation, evacuating air with pumps, are all in common use. Switching of pods at full speed and the transport electronics system are new innovations.” At least three companies are working to be the first to get a Hyperloop system running. Of them Hyperloop One is well positioned to have a full-system test by the end of 2016 and a test station construction could start as soon as 2017. If Salo is chosen as its location, the first stage of a Hyperloop link between Finland and Sweden is predicted to be complete in six years’ time. The next steps in FS Links and Salo’s plans are to find partners to fund the public-private initiative (the total cost is estimated to be 19 billion euros) and then secure a final agreement with Hyperloop One. “There are still many things that need to be solved. But the pre-feasibility study shows the connection between Stockholm and Helsinki is not impossible,” Heimo says. “The challenges are money and execution.” While the proposed Helsinki-Stockholm route could take 12-15 years to build, Heimo is genuinely excited by the potential of the plans. A fast way to transport goods would open up completely new business opportunities, while people could quickly and easily commute from one country to another. “It would mean Southern Finland and Sweden would be like one city. If you can go from one to the other in half an hour, you could go to Stockholm for business discussions as easily as for a cup of coffee in your own neighborhood cafe,” Heimo concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gamelayer-seeks-game-changer/,GameLayer seeks to be a game changer,"Gamification is a buzzword that attracts many but is seemingly understood by few. This Helsinki-based startup aims to change that. Think about the last game that you played. What were the things that kept you coming back for more? Well, these mechanisms can also be leveraged for business services, engaging and motivating user activity. “Gamification is not about creating a game at all, or even fun,” states  , CEO of  . “It’s about creating long-lasting loyalty to an app or service.” Clarifying the gamification buzzword has been one of Judge’s chief aims ever since he founded the company in 2012. After leaving his post at Nokia, he sought to further develop the work he had started whilst at the Finnish communications giant. “I wanted to continue this idea of creating a new and flexible platform for app developers and service providers,” Judge says. “This would leverage the kind of things we find in games that catch your attention and keep you motivated.” The end result is Snap!, a SaaS platform providing cloud-based mechanics that can be integrated into any app or service to motivate and engage users. GameLayer sets out to challenge a common misconception many companies have regarding their customers. Given the omnipresent free-to-play model of games these days, Judge emphasises that it’s important for app and service providers to consider moving beyond merely an acquisition focus. “Acquiring customers is obviously still very important,” he says. “However, keeping them is even more so. Most acquisition is lost in the first month. Something like 80 per cent of apps are downloaded once and then deleted. It’s really about speaking to your existing base, keeping them happy and coming back for more.” GameLayer helps to create long-lasting loyalty to an app or service, states CEO Steven Judge. To illustrate the point, Judge opens his laptop to show how the Snap! platform has been used for the past 12 months by Veikkaus, Finland’s state-owned betting agency. “We have been powering a gamified loyalty programme for them,” he says. “Almost 150 000 users have signed up. Veikkaus publishes missions for its users to complete, which can be anything that adds business value such as watching a video about a new product, or following the brand on social media.” All the while users accumulate ‘experience points’ as they familiarise themselves with various aspects of the company, and can redeem those points for rewards provided by Veikkaus. “Users are also able to level up and compete with other players on the rankings,” Judge explains. “It’s going really well so far.” Indeed – users have completed over 8.5 million missions in around ten months. Having designed Snap! to be as flexible and open as possible, GameLayer is also attracting interest from airlines, hotel chains, banks and insurance companies, along with education service and retail providers. Other potential avenues include public transport and  -inspired location services. Not to be outdone, health and wellbeing is also on its radar. “When I set up GameLayer we had a few ideologies,” Judge says. “One of the underlying principals is that we can use these game-like experiences to make a positive impact on society, or a group of people or simply just a handful of individuals.” Now, with its first significant customer under its belt, the company is looking forward to a day when the gamification buzzword becomes somewhat obsolete and has evolved to become just another part of the service design process. “We have proven the technology and approach – it is stable, scalable and secure,” Judge explains. “It’s really just about building up the distribution now.” To do this, the company is currently seeking to attract investors. “We are currently looking for funding opportunities, so we can hire a couple of critical resources to capitalise on the opportunity and make the product offering more broad.” Finland’s state-owned betting agency Veikkaus has used the Snap! platform for the past 12 months."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ruuvitag-beacon-light-open-source/,RuuviTag a beacon of light in open-source,"A year ago this Finnish company set out to create a superior open-source sensor beacon platform that fulfils the needs of developers, creators, hobbyists, students, IoT companies and also regular, everyday people. They have succeeded. Given Finland’s global status as educational pioneers, it’s little surprise that tech innovations from up this way can also support future developments in learning. Stand-alone Bluetooth 5-ready sensor beacon platform   is one such example, making its presence known in the midst of this increasingly hands-on space. Containing integrated environmental sensors such as temperature, humidity and air pressure RuuviTag can thus be deployed as a weather station, teaching children about the conditions around them. “Imagine one Tag, with a several-year battery life, broadcasting sensor data outside a school,” says  , CEO, Ruuvi Innovations. “Students can check their phones for real-time weather information and learn of the possibilities that technology enables. It’s both fun and educational.” Preaching the prevalence of precipitation in Finland is hardly the final word in education for RuuviTag. In fact, the fully configurable and easy to use technology forms the basis of its bigger plan to make the IoT accessible for everyone. “Older and more advanced young minds could learn by creating similar applications themselves, or even create totally new, innovative hardware products,” Jämsä says. “We have a passion for beautiful open-source electronics,” declares Lauri Jämsä, CEO, Ruuvi Innovations. “RuuviTag can be used as a standard Eddystone / iBeacon proximity beacon, but it has the potential to be so much more because it’s 100 per cent open-source and filled with sensors.” Aside from other everyday uses, such as keeping tabs on your valuables, the company also offers a customised design process for those tasks that may be a little out of reach. Jämsä also points out that the technology is powerful enough to suit the needs of demanding business customers. The Physical Web is a good example of the tech’s potential application. “The idea behind the Physical Web is that every object can have their own website,” Jämsä enthuses. “These objects are basically beacons that use Google’s Eddystone protocol to broadcast URL addresses everyone can find. The technology is new and we are one of the first ones taking advantage of it.” RuuviTags can also be used to create large mesh networks of up to thousands of sensor nodes. “They can be connected to the Internet through a single gateway,” Jämsä states. “It’s a great choice for industrial customers.” Whilst many proximity beacon products are already available on the market, RuuviTag distinguishes itself by being open-sourced. In fact, this approach proved to be the impetus for the RuuviTag team to start developing their product at the beginning of last year. “Open-source hardware is a direction most companies don’t feel comfortable venturing into,” Jämsä says. “But at Ruuvi this is not the case. We have a passion for beautiful open-source electronics.” Having bootstrapped during its initially phase, the next step in the RuuviTag plan saw the company seeking to attract some wider attention and funds, via Kickstarter. Reaching their desired amount of 10 000 US dollars in less than four hours, the beacon ended up attracting over 170 000 US dollars. The funds are to be used for mandatory certifications and manufacturing the devices for backers. “Ruuvi aims to be one of the top open-source hardware influencers in the IoT market by the end of the decade,” Jämsä outlines. “This will be achieved by creating innovative and powerful open-source products that individuals and companies actually need.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/huone-meets-international-market/,Huone aims to meet the international market,"This Helsinki-based company is looking to provide global customers with innovative spaces where they can hold memorable meetings and events. Looking back over your career, how many CEOs have made an impact on you? Whilst some may have been kind and others fearless, perhaps there may have also been a few leaders who are memorable for less than pleasant reasons. Whatever the case, how many do you recall that have actually burst into song, with their vocal gymnastics matched only by the blur of their fancy footwork? No one come to mind? Well, a glance at Finnish company  ’s website, and this is exactly what you will discover. The joy emerging from their self-produced music video   is not only palpable, it is infectious. “I am the dancing CEO,” says  , with a laugh. “My sister is the singing chef and   is our rapping investor. We have the entire staff dancing at the end. It’s just a normal day at the office.” Striving to offer a fresh approach is Huone’s  . Taking the Finnish word for ‘room’ as its title, Huone is a hotel that offers different meeting spaces, filling a much needed gap in the market in the process. With 12 different themes on offer, guests can choose from the likes of wine, library, sport and cellar rooms. Unsurprisingly, given their music video, this is far from a stuffy business idea devoid of inspiration. Depending on the room, facilities on offer can also include anything from a Playstation to a sauna (this is Finland, after all), with a fully stocked bar also close at hand. The formula has struck a chord. Having worked their way from the ground up over the past four years, the Huone team has gone on to host more than 4 000 events. Now, it’s time to head abroad. In fact, this Finnish innovation has plans to expand the concept to the world’s top 10 meeting cities by 2025,  . Indeed. Currently 12 different types of rooms are on offer. “Singapore is the number one meeting city in the world for the sixth year in the row,” Söderlund states. “It is also a hub for the whole of South-East Asia and APAC in general. A lot of regional meetings are being held there. The infrastructure and airlines and hotels and other things are well established. It is basically top of the top.” With Huone Singapore set to open its doors by February 2017, Söderlund hopes to tap into the city’s dominant Chinese business culture. “Going to Singapore we are actually trying to find out what the differences between the East and West are and whether or not our concept will work,” she explains. “If it goes well, who is to say we can’t go to China and to the USA.” In order to help facilitate its growing ambitions, the company is currently looking to raise up to 800 000 euros via a  . Heading abroad seems a natural step for the company, with the growing number of awards accumulating on its mantelpiece reflecting its expanding customer base. “There is nobody focusing on what we are focusing on,” Söderlund says. “Nobody is trying to revitalise the meeting experience as a whole through meeting design. We are not just selling you a space, we are bringing you a solution to maximise your meeting.” And if the earlier-mentioned music video is anything to go by, Huone is leading by example by getting people to work better together. “We are a group of very young people,” Söderlund says. “It’s a family business. We are not driven by money – we are driven by the happiness of our clients.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/olento-life-can-save-marriage/,Olento Life can save your marriage,"This Finnish startup has created a mobile solution that helps to steady the ship when relationships sail into choppy waters. Some years ago cracks started to appear in the relationship between   and his then-wife. Whilst both of them worked hard to get the spark back with and without therapists, nothing seemed to help. They ultimately decided to file for divorce. In a way, the first product launched by Lange’s company,  , is a story of his personal growth. After his family fractured, Lange started to ponder the concept of relationships and their DNA. Having already spent the previous decade building digital consumer services for a living, he began to look at relationships as a process-like method. The result is  , an app that helps people understand where their relationship is at and provides tools for improving it. The method was not born overnight; instead, a considerable amount of research has been conducted over the course of its development, including a large-scale project with   and  . The app will soon be available outside of Finland. The free app consists of a basic questionnaire that enables couples to determine the status of their relationship, and a three-week fee-based programme that helps them give their relationship a boost. If further assistance is still needed, users can continue with additional programmes by paying a monthly fee. We Did It also provides users with interesting statistics and allows them to compare their relationship to others in various areas. “The aim is to change the relationships through action,” Lange explains. “The app will help people realise what is important for them and what is important for their partner, and how to merge these things together.” Just as the unique nature of every couple represents a summary of the individual needs and dreams of two people, each We Did It session mirrors the specific duo in question. Studies have shown that the app’s greatest impact is made on communication and sex and intimacy. The ways in which We Did It approaches these specific problems can be divided into awareness and actions. “The analysis makes people aware of the situation, and actions bring the change that is needed,” Lange outlines. Although We Did It is currently only available in Finland, the next version slated for release in a few months’ time is targeted at the international market, and will be localised into different languages. The app is designed to serve everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or culture. Initially, the main target group will be in the Western market, though Lange also points to Asia and Arabic-speaking countries as additional regions of interest. With all of this in mind, the CEO still underlines that the app is not a substitute for therapy. Rather, it offers couples a chance to become hands-on healers of their own relationship. For some, booking a therapy session might be too big a hurdle to overcome, therefore downloading an app and dealing with the issues at home in a more comfortable environment can suit them better. “I’d say We Did It is a more intimate, fun and straightforward way to increase health and happiness in a relationship,” he states. “When both commit, the effects are immediate.” After founding Olento Life in 2013, these days Peeter Lange is joined by two employees and a wide range of mentors. The team is set to double in size by the end of the year."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/familings-finnish-startup-mattress-innovation-babies/,No more tears: Innovative Finnish mattress rocks babies to sleep,"It is said the best innovations stem from a real need. This is the case with Familings, a Finnish startup whose mattress innovation is helping babies –  and parents – sleep better. A good night’s sleep is top of the wish list for most new parents, and   was not an exception when her first child was born four years ago. During the countless hours spent rocking her baby to sleep, Sissala started to wonder if there were any products that could help. “Our baby cried a lot and everybody was stressed so I started to research products that could help rock the baby and allow the whole family to sleep better,” Sissala recalls. “I found different baby rockers, but they were meant for living rooms and are not good for babies to sleep in.” Not one to shy away from a challenge, Sissala decided to solve the problem herself and soon the concept for a mattress that is safe, comfortable and gently rocks a baby to sleep was born. She found a three-member team to develop the product, named the company ‘ ’ and finally launched the baby mattress in early September. Early results are promising. “I have used the mattress with my second child. Before the mattress he slept only 10 minute naps, but afterwards he started to sleep for 45 minutes,” Sissala says. “I have experienced first-hand how much easier everyday life is when a baby gets enough sleep.” So how does the mattress work? A motor in the mattress gently tightens and loosens the top fabric creating a slow up and down rocking movement. This means the whole mattress does not need to move so there is no risk, for example, of a baby getting their fingers trapped. Sissala came up with the idea for a self-rocking baby mattress when her first born would cry for hours without falling asleep. “We went through all the EU guidance on electrical and children’s products and furniture to consider all possible risks,” explains Sissala. “It was not easy to find a very safe way to create the rocking movement, but we did it.” In addition, the mattress fits any standard size crib and its breathable mesh fabric allows air to pass through, even if a baby turns to sleep on their tummy. “You can see a mother has been involved in the design,” Sissala laughs. “There have not been any compromises.” And praise for Familings is growing. The mattress was chosen as the best kids furniture at the ‘Kind + Jugend’ trade fair in Germany immediately after launch and it  has attracted over 100 000 euros in funding from Finnish angel investors and the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). Currently the mattress is only sold online, but Familings is in discussions with a number of potential retailers in Finland. After Familings has ensured production works seamlessly with larger volumes, it will look at expanding to other European markets starting with Sweden. But word has already started to spread. “We get international enquiries every day and we have already been contacted about licensing deals in Australia, South Korea and the US,” Sissala says. “Almost 50 per cent of babies have trouble sleeping, no matter the country, so this is truly a global problem.” Familings is a rare startup today in that it has a physical product instead of a digital one. While the road from an idea to the market is never easy, Sissala recommends everyone gives entrepreneurship a try if they truly believe in an idea. “Do not give up if one door, two doors or even ten doors close. When you find one investor who believes in the product, it will give you a major boost going forward,” Sissala summarises. Or, in the case of Familings, a major boost moving gently from side-to-side."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/s-game-mygamez-china/,It’s game-on for MyGamez in China,"A growing number of international games developers are lining up to access the lucrative Chinese market. Now they can boot up faster than the competition. Since its release in 2012, Finnish developer  ’s   has become one of the most successful mobile games in the world. Not only have more than 400 million users traversed its various undulating surfaces, but the game has also managed to crack the fickle Chinese market. And it has done so in style,  . Thanks to  . MyGamez is a Finnish-Chinese company that facilitates a smooth road for international game developers seeking to bring their titles to China. Given the prevalence of unforeseen hurdles that could potentially snag companies along the way, MyGamez has had no shortage of demand for its service. “Together with my Chinese co-founder we are able to provide the partnership and communication interface and company culture that our Western partners are used to getting in Europe,” explains CEO  . “A lot of differences in business culture often cause problems in interaction, even when intentions are good. We definitely have the advantage of bridging the gap.” Aside from tiptoeing around cultural misunderstandings, there are a number of other factors to consider for developers. Firstly, the casual games market in China looks very favourably on uncomplicated gameplay, with titles containing little or no back-story proving to be very popular. Oh my! MyGamez gets games companies off to a flying start. Once this box is checked, then its time to proceed to the next level, where some important adjustments are required. “Changes to monetisation and design are needed, as most Western free-to-play games use both advertisement revenues and in-app purchases,” Leinonen says. “In the Chinese Android market you have to remove advertisements and often have to make the in-app purchase monetisation design more aggressive to lure consumers to spend more.” This can often be the deciding factor whether developers can actually access the market. MyGamez reluctantly has to turn away certain games, if their core needs to be tweaked too drastically. But, for those who pass this stage, the next step is clarifying what’s required of gamers. “Chinese players are used to very comprehensive tutorials that walk them through the gameplay hand-in-hand,” Leinonen points out. “In the beginning there should be concrete steps to ‘press this’, ‘follow that’ and ‘click here to purchase’. You don’t really see this in Western games.” MyGamez offers unparalleled security for its customers, with companies not required to hand over their game’s source code when the solution is being integrated. Another significant advantage Mygamez has over similar service providers is speed. Its single SDK model of billing means the game is live in all major Chinese Android stores as soon as one month after the localisation project has commenced. “The publishing model we provide to foreign, non-Chinese companies is so much better than what our competitors offer,” Leinonen underlines. “Other companies need something more like four-to-eight months.” Having already accumulated revenue of two million euros during its first year of operations, the team of 26 is now looking to expand its future even more rapidly. Thus, MyGamez recently teamed up with China’s largest telecommunications provider, China Mobile, to launch the International Mobile Gaming Awards (IMGA) programme in China. This highly visible partnership also means that MyGamez gets the first look at games that apply for IMGA. Enabling them to spot the Next Big Thing before the rest of the crowd, the company is poised to swiftly start bringing in a lot of new games. “We are in a position to quickly grow into one of the leading publishers in China,” Leinonen enthuses. MyGamez CEO Mikael Leinonen and China Mobile gaming subsidiary Migu Interactive CEO Wang Gang signed the IMGA China cooperation agreement in Nanjing."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-usetrace-joins-prestigious-us-accelerator/,Finnish startup Usetrace joins prestigious US accelerator,"Usetrace has developed its cloud-based test automation tool for web developers since 2012 and is now on the verge of a big breakthrough. In July it became only the second Finnish startup to join renowned US accelerator programme ‘500 Startups’.  “We believe this is the best accelerator programme for a company like us,” says  ,   co-founder and CEO. “They have highly qualified staff and a strong portfolio of past successes.” Heino has reason to be excited. 500 Startups is ranked as one of the top five accelerators in the world and has worked with hundreds of ambitious companies. The four-month programme gives Usetrace (and its test automation software with the same name) access to world-class mentoring, workshops and a wide contact network. Furthermore, all accepted startups will receive a 100 000-US dollar investment. “The fact we can learn how to better explain our vision, to plan efficient growth trials and expand our reach in our main target market [is very valuable],” Heino explains. “The biggest names in our sector have already been speaking here.” To fully benefit from the experience, three of Usetrace’s five-member team moved to San Francisco in July to join the programme. It is major feat as under four per cent of applicants get accepted by the accelerator. Usetrace was born in 2012 when Heino and co-founder   grew tired of laborious test programming slowing down digital product development. Today the startup counts over 60 companies in eight countries as customers, including a major Finnish digital learning solution provider, Sanoma Pro. “When one customer shows Usetrace how a certain test is done, the same test is available to all our customers. The learning speed is huge,” says Heino (right), explaining how the company’s test automation tool works. “Usetrace was founded to enable as fast product development as possible so software engineers can focus their time on creating added value for their customers,” Heino says. “We have helped Sanoma to speed up their development 12-fold and achieve annual savings of 220 000 euros.” How does this work in practice? The artificial tester doesn’t require installations or coding, but learns its tasks automatically. All a developer needs to do is use their app or website like their customers would (fill in forms, browse the site) and the cloud-based software learns to repeat these actions over and over again. Any faults in the user experience are revealed quickly. This is particularly helpful after updates and [SMS] alerts can be sent if problems are detected. The end result is time spent on testing is reduced and developer resources are freed up for other tasks while end-users get faster access to the latest services and upgrades. While Usetrace has had a good start, a great product alone is not enough to crack the global market and this is where 500 Startups steps in. Usetrace is particularly looking for help to boost its marketing skills and online growth. This is also where Heino sees the biggest differences between startup cultures in Finland and the US. Both are full of enthusiasm and hard-working people, but the starting points can be miles apart. “Technological expertise is very strong in Finland and many people start programming at a young age. My dad and grandmothers are programmers and I have always been surrounded by computers,” Heino describes. “In the US the strength is storytelling. People seem to learn at birth how to talk about something in a way people can relate to.” Usetrace is already practicing the latter as Heino paints a picture of the startup’s future. While its current focus is on automating processes in software development, this is just the start. “First we will expand to other tasks and areas in the digital world and then we will move to the physical world,” Heino summarises. “With artificial intelligence and automation we can make physical processes more efficient and leave more time for creative work.” Usetrace is ready to think big."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/named-clothing-lets-anyone-fashion-designer/,Named Clothing lets anyone be a fashion designer,"Two sisters decided to turn their passion for fashion into career, and in doing so, they created a sustainable brand that encourages creativity. Ever seen the perfect coat – but in the wrong shade of yellow? Or a skirt that would be just right – if only it was an inch longer?  and  , the two sisters behind  , share a passion for sewing and design. Four years ago, they were on their way to have dinner with their parents and started to contemplate alternatives to their then-careers. Saara has a degree in clothing, Laura is a shoe designer, and they both worked in design – but not quite exactly where they wanted to. Both agreed that ready-made patterns that would’ve suited them were few and far between. Once they reached their parents’ house, the idea was born: the sisters would start designing clothes and, instead of selling the clothes, they would sell patterns. A lot has happened since that dinner, however not exactly from the get-go. In 2013, Named Clothing opened a webstore. The first weeks were almost dead quiet. “Occasionally a friend of ours would order a pattern, just to support us,” Laura says laughingly. The jackpot came by accident when a UK-based blog published   about the budding entrepreneurs. Suddenly orders were almost flooding in, at least in comparison to, well, the day before. Talvikki sweater is part of Named Clothing’s winter collection Evolution Theory. Now the Huhta sisters host their own office and showroom in Alppila, near central Helsinki. Before the white-walled, Scandinavian-style office was opened, the headquarters were a room in Saara’s flat. Named Clothing releases two collections per year. Initially the plan was to offer fabrics and other sewing materials alongside with the package that includes the pattern and a detailed instruction sheet. That proved to be far too much work for the duo alone, so for now the focus is on designing and delivering patterns. The vast majority of Named Clothing’s retailers are abroad in places like the UK, the US, Australia, France, Switzerland and Portugal. Almost all online orders come from outside of Finland; mainly women between 20 and 40 years of age. Saara and Laura Huhta believe people are growingly interested in the origin and ethical aspects of their clothes. Money is another factor. “Sewing your own clothes might not be cheaper than buying them from high street shops, but by choosing the right materials self-made clothes last longer,” the sisters note. “And you’ll never see someone wear the same thing as you.” Since the launch of the first collection in 2013, the Huhtas have encountered various learning curves. Customer feedback has been essential, as too the help of other professionals. Numerous freelancers and government officials have helped Named Clothing to take its first steps, beginning from modelling for website photos and the sisters’ mother assisting with everything from sewing samples to basic bureaucracy. “We do pay our mom when she works for us!” Laura adds hastily. With the help of an intern who recently started working at Named Clothing, the two women have a little more time in their hands for developing the company. They are hoping to find a sales and marketing professional in the team as soon as possible. “There are so many ideas we would love to follow through. Right now all we’ve got time for are the essentials, but hopefully that’ll change.” Using patterns leaves room for customer’s imagination, as there are plenty of possibilities for customising the end result."

Tune in this week to discover what’s going on with learning music and belting out your favourite tune. Doing away with the need for chord lexicons, chord generators and learning irrational “dots on diagrams”, this musical app offers a simple approach to becoming nimble on the six-string. “Our company is all about providing a guitarist the best possible tool for guitar chords,” stated brand manager   . Suitable for every level, genre and style from very early stages onwards, the app gives all the theory and practical info needed for forming the right finger configuration, in order to find the sound you are looking for. No need to despair if you weren’t born a child prodigy, this jamming and scale discovery tool has come to the rescue. Diluting music theory into an easy-to-grasp form via a unique onscreen wheel, users can start playing along in their favourite musical style in seconds. “We wanted to make a new way to teach and learn music,” creator    . “It’s a completely fresh approach to how scales and chords work. Swiftly becoming the App Store’s number one paid music app in nine countries, MusiClock’s offering has since extended to a wooden version and a piano scaler tool. You can’t rack up over 20 international awards without having some kind of finger on the pulse of innovative ideas. In the case of this Finnish startup, more surprising perhaps is the candid attitude of those who come up with them. “You need a good number of dumb ideas in order to generate one great idea,” company CEO    , “and we welcome all kinds of ideas.” For now, they have settled on four: three learning games and a tuner app. Thanks to these over 25 million people in 154 countries – and counting – have successfully negotiated the fretboard. Wondering what the guitar, ukulele, phone camera and karaoke all share in common? Well, ponder no more, as this Finnish startup is a meeting place for all three. “As much as 85 per cent of people who start to play the guitar let it go because they can’t get past the first stage [of learning the chords],”   . “Our number one goal is to help people start jamming and to play their own favourite songs as soon as possible.” To achieve this goal, the startup has so far released three mobile apps, which assist with playing tunes on guitar and ukulele. Singa is the easiest way to sing karaoke. What else would you expect from person who organised the annual   in Finland for years? “Not many would consider karaoke to be a very sexy industry. But few people know that it is a 10 billion-euro-a-year business,” CEO    , back when the company was known as Singster. Now, with a playlist boasting over 20 000 hit tunes from a wide range of artists, it’s time to exercise your vocal instrument whilst utilising your desktop, smart device or Apple TV."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/hostaway-makes-life-easier-airbnb-hosts/,Hostaway makes life easier for Airbnb hosts,"A small Finnish startup has developed technology for the holiday rental industry that prevents booking clashes when utilising multiple booking platforms. If you start looking you never know what you might find.   was researching the holiday rental industry one day when he came across an important discovery. “I interviewed almost 30 companies that managed Airbnb apartments for a living and they had a big problem: managing their sales channels,” he says. Airbnb is one of several online marketplaces which allow people to rent their homes to travellers. This industry is rapidly expanding, but the popularity causes problems. If a host lists a home on multiple websites it is a chore to keep track of them all and avoid double bookings. “In the beginning I was sceptical, because airlines and hotels had solved this issue already in the ‘80s and ‘90s,” Räder continues. “After testing 40 solutions I agreed with my interviewees: there was no software for managing sales channels that worked. That’s why I decided to start  .” A world of accommodation opportunities is in the palm of your hand. The Finnish startup Hostaway connects multiple platforms such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Flipkey, Expedia and HomeAway. Through them a host can rent their homes more efficiently and profitably. “Our service takes a few seconds to set up, and allows a current Airbnb host to sign up and manage multiple sales channels,” Räder says. “There are many benefits to this. You get more bookings. Airbnb is not the only channel out there. You get diversification, so you aren’t relying on just one company. You also get ease of use.” Imagine the hassle it would be to continually monitor multiple channels. If you rent your place through one service, you would need to immediately go to the others to say it is no longer available. If you are too slow you risk annoying customers who tried to rent your home which was listed as available. “It takes a lot of effort to sign up on various channels and keep rates and availability updated,” Räder continues. “We have automated this so the user just has to sign up and choose the desired channels. We automatically create an account, upload the property and synchronise the calendars by the click of a button.” The big rental services have taken note of Hostaway and understand the Finns can help their businesses. Expedia even awarded the company for their innovation. “Many of the bigger companies have tens of thousands of employees, rely on old computer architecture and their processes need to adapt to the realities of the sharing economy,” Räder explains. “It takes time, but the industry is changing. We are working closely with our partners to ensure their business requirements are met and our hosts get more bookings.” Currently Hostaway is focusing on markets which have an oversupply of short-term rental units where hosts struggle to get bookings. Western and Southern Europe are big markets, while Asia is growing rapidly. North America is also open to new technology. The company is now in the midst of a massive update based on user feedback and couldn’t be happier how Hostaway has developed. According to company CEO Marcus Räder (left), Hostaway’s strength comes its ease of use: “We have automated this so the user just has to sign up and choose the desired channels.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/el-site-illuminates-construction-sites-around-world/,EL & Site illuminates construction sites worldwide,"With an original product in a highly competitive industry, this Finnish company aspires to light construction sites globally. Innovation can take many forms. Sometimes it’s a question of creating a product that is so radically new that it upends the industry. But it can also come down to taking an existing product, and improving on it so dramatically that it takes the concept to a new level. The latter was the road chosen by   when it embarked on developing its signature product. “ , who founded the firm, used to work at an equipment rental company,” says the company’s marketing and export manager  . “He noticed that site lights they rented out were fragile and had to be constantly fixed. So, he figured that there just has to be a better way.” Lamberg built a team and set out to develop an improved site light intended to withstand the rough conditions of a construction site. The resulting light, MBerg, has since become the key product for EL & Site. Unlike regular, fluorescent, temporary construction site lights, MBerg is a LED light, which makes it very robust, maintenance-free and gives it a longer life time. “All our products have something special about them that makes them stand out,” states Kati van Heerden. The MBerg is almost entirely a made-in-Finland product: it was designed in the country, and nearly all its components are produced in Finland. The lights are assembled in the Helsinki suburb of Pitäjänmäki where the company employs eight under 25-year-olds. (All-in-all the company has a staff of 12.) In addition to its self-produced lights, EL & Site offers other products related to temporary lighting and electricity solutions, such as switchboards and transformers. “All our products have something special about them that makes them stand out. For instance, our switchboards are the ‘Rolls-Royces’ of that category,” van Heerden says. “Generally, our approach is to offer high-end products rather than to compete with pricing.” Some of the biggest construction sites in Finland that EL & Site has provided lighting for include the new children’s hospital being built in Meilahti, the Tripla complex in Pasila, and Hotel Torni in Tampere. But abroad, even bigger opportunities are emerging. The French market has especially been auspicious: Bouygues, one of the largest construction companies in Europe, initially used MBerg lights when building an Ibis hotel by the Paris Orly Airport. Impressed with the product, the company currently uses them at various other sites all around France, and EL & Site is also in talks with a major French equipment rental company, van Heerden says. Not to be outdone, the company was also   at the European Rental Awards in Stockholm back in June. As for further plans, EL & Site already has on-going projects in Iran, Spain, Italy, and other parts of Europe – but it may head out to new markets even farther away. “Lighting is a seasonal product, and it’s always a dark period in some part of the world. That’s why we’re thinking about the southern hemisphere, and there’s already been some interest in Australia,” van Heerden says. “Our products are in demand in Finland during the dark wintertime, so the coming winter will be a busy period for us. But once the darkest season is over it will be a good time for us to take stock and reflect on where to go next.” Let there be light. Alongside France, the company already has on-going projects in Iran, Spain, Italy, and other parts of Europe."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/enfucell-offers-supple-power-every-sensor/,Enfucell offers supple power for every sensor,"If this Finnish company’s flexible solutions are not under your skin yet, they may well be on it before long. Whilst it may seem difficult to channel notions of Atlanta when looking out an office window in Vantaa – the Nordic October weather having well and truly set in – comparisons can nevertheless be drawn between a certain beverage giant based in the Deep South and a battery technology innovator from Finland. “We’re a bit like the Coca-Cola Company,” explains   CEO  . “They sell the concentrate that is mixed with water at the bottling plant. The bottlers cannot get the job done with any other producer’s concentrate. We have a similar situation in what we do. In essence, we’re a chemical company, preparing inks for our clients in the printed electronics industry, and their printing machines turn this ink into battery power.” Enfucell’s all-printed power source, SoftBattery, is both flexible and thin, which comes in handy in IoT-related applications in different fields like health care. “Adhesive smart patches powered by Enfucell batteries offer a supple solution in places such as against human skin, without making the experience uncomfortable for the user,” Ellilä says. One area where the company has made significant impact is that of the quality of life for the more mature members of society. Staff at Kauniala Hospital in Kauniainen, Finland, had been looking for a remote monitoring solution for their predominantly elderly clients living at home, and they found one with the battery innovator’s help. Golf club heads have smartened up their act, thanks to Enfucell. “By applying an Enfucell-powered monitoring patch on the client’s body, it is possible to prolong independent life for many people, and if something alarming happens, the care personnel at the hospital will immediately be alerted through the Internet,” Ellilä says. The batteries in the skin patch have enough power in them for a week’s operation, and the patches are replaced by a roaming nurse on scheduled home visits, and the electronics are reused. The field of sports is another budding application area. “We collaborated with the electronics giant Qualcomm in the development of light and inconspicuous smart labels for golf club heads, to measure things such as club head velocity, clubface angles and swing speed and transmit the data via Bluetooth to devices for coaching purposes,” Ellilä pours on with measured clarity. The solution has attracted plenty of interest among developers of smart sports tech, and there are application scenarios for other sports as well, tennis and ice hockey included. Amidst all this technical wizardry, one can’t help beginning to imagine high-tech in future sports: “Hey, you know our dads had   smart tags on these things back in the day – what Neanderthals!” Who knows if Enfucell’s power will one day bring life to inanimate flying objects like baseballs or discs in that other golf game so beloved by the hoodie-wearing members of society? Whatever sensors are used, they all need a power source. The company is already getting the crowd involved. Aiming to broaden their investor base before potentially going public on First North, they set up a crowdfunding round with  , attracting over 400 000 euros. “The funds now acquired will find good use in international sales and marketing,” the CEO continues. “Several promising projects are ready for a monetisation phase over the coming years. These are expected to generate a significant amount of revenue by 2018.” What’s the pet project for the CEO, heading the currently six-strong team? “One field I got my sights set on is industrial maintenance,” Ellilä enthuses. “I see potential in smart stickers placed in factory equipment for diagnostic purposes to speed up and facilitate troubleshooting.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/confidence-begins-bottom-danish-guy/,Confidence begins from the bottom for The Other Danish Guy,"A burning sensation in your buttocks doesn’t generally tend to lead to pleasant things. For The Other Danish Guy, it did – but only after a good recovery. , a man with about 20 years of consulting and expert level experience in marketing, always knew he wanted to create his own brand from scratch. After having “helped some brands succeed and contributed to some failing”, he had a clear idea as to what works and what doesn’t. Thus it was time Lähde and his long-time friend and colleague   to put their thinking hats on. Three things were essential. Firstly, what is for sale has to be a consumer product people actually need, want and pay for. Second, no price regulation allowed. Third: a strong brand should put the product ahead the competition. The men kept on working as consultants whilst planning their next step. One of the business trips took the duo to New York, where Pesonen found out he was wearing an ill-fitting pair of underwear. Long story short: a few days and a lot of lotion later he ended up in a Wall Street bar ladies’ loo trying to soothe his wounds, and ended up severely scaring some innocent women – whom the bartender then comforted by saying “the other Danish guy is having a problem”. [Curious to hear the whole story? Watch it at the end of the article.] Witnessing your colleague’s tail end in pain might not be a turning point for many startups. Yet, to The Other Danish Guy, it’s essentially where everything started. After this incident, two more rules were established. “Never again would we share a hotel room. I’d seen enough – or too much,” Lähde says with a grin. The other one was about underwear. Every time Lähde and Pesonen travel together, Pesonen would have to wear comfortable undies. Tommi Lähde wishes people had more courage and less cynicism. “What would you do if you stood no chance of failing?” Lähde made sure of this by marching him into the flagship store of a brand he liked and forked out 800 euros on dozens of pairs for Pesonen. Then it dawned on them: comfortable underwear, as daily and essential as it is, was hard to come by. Also, underwear as a product ticked all of their three boxes: a consumer product, no price regulation, and branding matters. Also, the witty name: The Other Danish Guy, in the need of fresh undies in downtown New York City. “At first it was all a joke. Then I happened to come across some business intelligence data and noticed athletic leisure clothing market was skyrocketing. That’s when new players can step in the game,” Lähde explains. After researching fashion and sport businesses, the duo spent about a year building strategies for sales, marketing and distribution. The resultant brand belongs to Lähde & Co, a company jointly owned and run by Lähde and Pesonen. Although the fashion industry is one of the most competitive in the world, men’s underwear scene is dominated by big names. Lähde and Pesonen weren’t afraid to stand up to the likes of Calvin Klein. “People in general should have more courage. What would you do if you stood no chance of failing?” Lähde asks – rhetorically. The Other Danish Guy sells underwear for both men and women. Currently The Other Danish Guy sells underwear for both men and women. The focus is strictly on “things that touch the skin” and keeping them classy and comfortable at the same time. That, Lähde has found out, is the source of confidence. “In our discussions with customers, we’ve learned that particularly for women confidence begins from underwear – including in situations where no one else sees it.” Contrary to the norm in clothing industry, the duo wanted to keep production in Europe. The products are manufactured in a factory in Portugal, where there’s no cutting short when it comes to environmental or other ethical issues. “We visited the factory and wanted to get to know the process from meeting employees to seeing what happened to water after it’s used for dyeing,” Lähde notes. As underwear is worn all over the globe, The Other Danish Guy is facing a huge crowd of potential buyers. The first target is in Germany, where negotiations with retailers, distributors and brand ambassadors are at full steam. Lähde deems Europe as the core market, at least for starters. One country in particular has proven interested. “We’ve received plenty of messages from Denmark,” Lähde says and laughs. “They ask if we’re Danish – and where they can get our products from.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-s-helsingo-makes-quality-and-design-affordable/,A.S.Helsingö makes quality and design affordable,"A Finnish company thrives with a unique blend of old world craftsmanship and an innovative digital business model that harnesses the reach of Ikea. Practically everyone would like a quality design kitchen, but few are willing or able to pay the costs. Now a company has come up with a solution which combines traditional craftsman quality with modern affordability. “  was founded on the belief that everyone deserves beautiful homes which are pleasant to live in – with an affordable price tag,” says  . “We want to make design more democratic. A beautiful home should not depend on the thickness of your wallet.” Schauman and his co-founder   had a simple yet revolutionary idea. They would provide high-quality made-to-order doors and handles to fit Ikea cabinet frames. This way A.S.Helsingö could offer kitchen cabinets, wardrobes and sideboards which have a true design feel but are much more affordable. The selection is designed by Scandinavian designers and made by Finnish master craftsmen. Man’s best friend is also chummy with these two Helsinki-based businessmen. “The response has been overwhelming, especially online,” Jokinen continues. “Younger people in the creative industries have been particularly excited to see a new, fresh alternative on the market. They also find it more natural to purchase fixtures online instead of a traditional brick-and-mortar store. All our products are purchased online.” Although until now their business has been housed on the Internet, A.S.Helsingö will soon open a showroom in downtown Helsinki. Clients can visit the showroom to see products and compare colour samples before making their orders online. But the real work the company does is far from the metropolitan area and is instead found deep in the Finnish heartland surrounded by pine forests and blue lakes. “Quality plays a central role in what we do,” says Jokinen. “Our doors are made with traditional methods and quality materials in the Finnish lake district. Our factory has been known for high-quality woodwork for several generations. We want to continue this tradition.” The process of purchasing a kitchen is straightforward. A client measures her space and makes design choices. Next, she orders Ikea cabinet frames from the METOD or PAX range, followed by the order to A.S.Helsingö for doors, handles, table tops, sinks and taps. Finally, the products are delivered and assembled. “As living space shrinks and gets more expensive, incorporating kitchens seamlessly into the interior décor become increasingly important,” Schauman says. “Our selection allows for letting the customers create their own unique products that fit their personality and taste.” There is a lot to choose from. A.S.Helsingö offers a customised style with a menu of options that can be combined in multiple ways to create a personalised product. “In recent months we have received serious interest from the other Nordic countries and Northern Europe,” says Schauman. “Sales to Stockholm have especially picked up and we’re looking into opening a showroom there next year.” They consider the Nordic region as their home market and plan to expand to continental Europe in the next couple of years. “We also offer affordable and great-looking updates to Ikea kitchens and wardrobes which are already installed: you can get an upgraded new style with our designs,” he concludes. “This is sustainable and smart.” Quality plays a central role in what A.S.Helsingö is about. Case-in-point: hand-polished handles."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/22260/,Five for Friday: Finnish Spirits,"The times they are a-changing in the world of Finnish spirits. This week it’s time to discover what’s going on with startups (and some familiar faces) who are plying the distillery trade. Located in Teurastamo, Helsinki’s former abattoir and current epicentre of food culture, this distillery has expanded its offering since becoming operational in 2014. As co-founder  , their success comes from sourcing locally: “For excellent whiskey, you have to start with the best raw materials you can get. It is not like making wines where you are so dependent on soil type and climate. In Finland, when it comes to making whiskey, we can compete with the best in the world.” Earlier this year, three of Kulinaario’s liqueurs were recognised at the New York International Spirits Competition. “This is a major acknowledgement of Finnish alcohol production and of our small company,”  . “What is particularly great about this is that our Liqueur Master   received international recognition for his expertise and his career of more than 45 years.” All of Kulinaario’s products are made with pure wild berries from Northern Finland and are aged at the Lepaa Winery. Whilst you probably may have heard of a certain company that produces scissors under the same moniker, rest assured that the village of Fiskars has a long and rich history. “Fiskars was actually one of the biggest mining industries in the area over 300 years ago,”  . “Nowadays our target is to be the biggest handcrafted alcohol village in Finland.” Spearheading this ambition is this distillery. Sourcing local hand-picked wild herbs to create its beverages, its initial focus is on aquavit. Not content with being recognised last year for  , this Ostrobothnia-based distillery also   in 2016 with its single malt rye new make. Running operations from an old dairy, the company is set to unleash its first batch of malted rye whisky onto the public next year. This Finnish stalwart has been spreading its wings of late, diversifying its offering and heading abroad with renewed vigour. Testament to this is its arrival on the shelves of UK retail chain Marks & Spencer last month. “Koskenkorva Vodka has undergone a significant rebranding work, and the vodka itself has received several international awards,”  . “Recent investments in Koskenkorva vodka have brought our key export brand positive attention, which also led to the deal with Marks & Spencer.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-shapes-new-kind-job-marketplace/,Finnish startup shapes new kind of job marketplace,"Digitalisation and the rise of ‘gig economy’ are transforming the way we work. Now Finnish startup Treamer is tapping into this market with a mobile app that anyone can use to find a job or become an employer. Does this situation sound familiar? You quickly need somebody to take care of an easy task at the home or around the office, but do not know who to ask. At the same time you know there will be plenty of people in close proximity who could do this task, but have no easy way of reaching them. Well now you do: “With our mobile app anyone can find help when they need it and easily take care of the employment process,” explains  , founder of Helsinki-based startup  . “When you need a babysitter or someone to fill in Excel sheets, the right person could be just a few clicks away.” How Treamer works is simple. Both individuals and businesses can use the Treamer app to broadcast a task they need done quickly. The app then scans available workers within a 20-kilometre radius, notifies them of the task and can match the job to the right worker in the matter of minutes. A review system ensures both parties are happy with the results. “After the job has been done, the employer can pay the salary using their bank card. We automatically ensure all taxes and obligatory employment fees are handled from that single lump sum,” Mäkitalo adds. The tasks advertised on Treamer can be anything from dog walking to graphic design, but they are strictly limited to jobs that will take a maximum of one day. And this approach is having success. According to Mäkitalo, Treamer has doubled its (currently undisclosed) user numbers every month since launching in April and shows no signs of slowing down. The Treamer app uses location scouting to match workers with the closest jobs available. Although anyone can sign up to Treamer, the role of worker is proving particularly popular with students and young adults looking to increase their work experience and boost their income. It is a group Mäkitalo knows well. The now 20-year-old entrepreneur got the idea four years ago when he had just started college. “I had done different kinds of temporary jobs and gigs for a few years and I really liked it as a student,” he recalls. “It was a great way to find out what you are good at and what you might like to do. At the same time you were able to define your own schedules.” But Mäkitalo quickly realised that finding these jobs without previous connections was not easy, even when companies were struggling to find enough helping hands. “I thought, ‘everybody has a phone in their pocket and they use it everyday so what if I take the work and the workers there’. That is how Treamer started to take shape,” Mäkitalo says. Finally a year ago Mäkitalo found experienced partners to accelerate development and Treamer was born. Today the company has four full-time employees and 500 000 euros of backing from private investors. Mäkitalo believes the key to Treamer’s speedy start is solving a real need, and the need is not limited to Finland. Treamer is already scouting international markets, and while Mäkitalo remains tight-lipped on the details, he promises there will be news next year. One thing is clear: the plans will be ambitious. “There is a global need to better connect temporary work with workers,” he offers. “We are building the world’s largest marketplace for them.” “When you need a babysitter or someone to fill in Excel sheets, the right person could be just a few clicks away,” states Treamer founder Matias Mäkitalo."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-taste-of-the-arctic/,A taste of the Arctic,"For superfood startups Love Arctic and Arctic Warriors, the clean Arctic nature is an overflowing source of inspiration – and pure ingredients. Once you have been there, you know it. The scarcely populated northernmost corner of Europe, enveloped in imposing wilderness, leaves its mark. There just seems to be something mufflingly unique in Lapland. For  , founder and CEO of  , love for the region was ultimately the reason for coming back to Finland, after spending half of her life abroad, and founding a superfood online store, which focuses on Arctic specialties. “In my view, Finnish Lapland is the world’s best kept secret,” Rinkinen says with a slight grin. That is certainly a bold statement, but Rinkinen seems to be convinced. Otherwise, she would not have left behind a decent career in Central Europe. Aside from honey shot, all of Arctic Warriors’ products are dairy-free, gluten-free and vegan-friendly. For Rinkinen Lapland has always been a special place; for rest, for sport, for fun and above all for clean natural flavours, the focus of her startup, Love Arctic. The likes of organic berry powders and dried berries, as well as flaxseed and berry mixtures compose the main menu of the company. “All the way, purity and quality have been Love Arctic’s core values,” she underlines. “They are in high regard among our key customer groups, who consist mainly of European town dwellers. Up to now, feedback has been encouraging.” At first, internationalisation within the European single market was more or less an easy move. Nevertheless, these days Love Arctic also targets more distant countries, where similar city residents value clean and organic superfood. “These are the kind of people who know what they want,” Rinkinen comments. “They are aware of their own consumer behaviour, demanding high-level, clean and ethical products. That is exactly what I want to provide.” Also extending their reach abroad is  , located in the village of Narkaus near the Arctic Circle. Recognised as the most innovative rural startup in Finland last year, the company specialises in boosts of locally sourced herbs such as angelica and rose root. “Angelica is a very antibacterial herb; it boosts your immunity,” explains co-founder  . “It’s very good for your digestion as well. Rose root is called the ginseng of the north. It balances the body. If you feel worn out it gives you more energy; if you are wired, it calms you down.” This is just merely the tip of the iceberg for harnessing the best of the Arctic, with Finnish companies   and   also embracing the power of the north. Given the superpowers inherent in the products on offer, it’s fitting that each product bears an individual cartoon character; the eponymous warriors. “The company name tells about the strengths and function of these herbs,” Kauppinen outlines “The warrior of defence protects the body, endurance keeps the stress away and energy is natural energy. Also the name is kind of a mission statement: we want to keep Lapland alive.” Actions also speak louder than words. Arctic Warriors has its own network of farmers and wildlife pickers from whom they source the raw material. Patience is a virtue, mind you, as angelica is harvested every two years, and roseroot every five. “Traditional farming doesn’t pay off in Lapland,” Kauppinen continues. “We have been able to give them new means of livelihood when they grow these special herbs.” “In my view, Finnish Lapland is the world’s best kept secret,” says Love Arctic founder and CEO Saara Rinkinen."

You are in luck: here are five more local fashion houses worth a look. Taking its name from a Thai word meaning ‘fine art’ and ‘elegance’, Vejits boasts patterns and designs that are emboldened by bright Asian colours intertwined with Nordic minimalism. “We are trying to find something new – angles, cuttings, silhouettes,” Turunen  . “Our ideas come from the colour of nature and the seasons; from leaves, snow, seas and so on.” Having produced workwear collections for companies such as Finnish fast-food giant Hesburger and British cosmetics chain The Body Shop, Touchpoint took an ecological left turn and launched a collection made from recycled materials. “We created a collection that is really fancy and sustainable,” the company  . “What we did is putting together the fashion world and ecological materials […].

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cyberlightning-shows-muscle-internet-things/,CyberLightning shows its muscle in IoT,"This Finnish company is an expert in gathering and analysing massive amounts of data from connected devices. It seems simple. You’re cold, so you turn up the thermostat and in no time at all you’re warm. What you don’t see is all the work done in the background to keep infrastructure like energy networks working. The Finnish company   makes sure such infrastructures work efficiently, but they aren’t an energy utility. Instead they specialise in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data. The IoT is a network of connected devices, while Big Data refers to huge and complex data sets. CyberLightning creates solutions to control and monitor IoT networks. In essence, they gather massive amounts of information from many connected devices, analyse it, and then display that data in an easy-to-visualise format which customers can then act upon. Their clients are large industrial companies which manage large networks. The energy industry is a prime example, as they need to control the complicated generation and transmission of power to millions of people. Things have been heating up since the company   a couple of years ago. “Our energy sector offering is expanding,” says CEO  . “We have helped solar energy management and developed smart grids offerings with our partners. We see big potential in Russia and are working on a case there now. We have also already deployed with the energy company Fortum for Espoo’s district heating system.” We’re already thinking beyond the Internet of Things to the Internet of Everything, which includes not just things but people, data and processes. The district heating system in Espoo, Finland includes a CHP power plant, nine heating plants, 13 pumping stations and 800 kilometres of underground piping which delivers heat to residents. The energy company wanted a wealth of information: production and network flow, operational data and even the location and status of maintenance teams in the field. Additionally, they needed weather data and predictive analysis: will it get colder tonight so we need more heat? Using their CyberVille platform, CyberLightning integrated all the data sources into a single processing engine. Data is displayed in a multi-layered 3D view, allowing efficient management of energy production while potential problems are swiftly identified and fixed. It is used with a simple point-and-tap interface just like a smartphone. And most importantly, when you turn up your thermostat you get heat. “CyberLightning’s software platform allows for distributed intelligence – using the cloud or small, embedded computers,” continues Mickelsson. “When you combine that with our analytics and communications our IoT platform is in its own category, a unique solution.” The Oulu-based company licenses their platform and software development kits to third parties who then build their own solutions. This method gives them a far greater reach than they would have otherwise. “We have a white label, commercial software solution which relates to large-scale deployments,” Mickelsson explains. “Then we also enable digital platform as a service, which anyone can set up for the masses.” The company has joined the Industrial Internet Consortium and the European Commission’s Future Internet project (FIWARE) and are deeply involved in how the technology is developing. “We’re already thinking beyond the Internet of Things to the Internet of Everything, which includes not just things but people, data and processes,” says Mickelsson. “There have been huge investments in the industry and more are coming. We have such a great opportunity for the future.” The company’s solution has already deployed with Finnish energy firm Fortum for the city of Espoo’s district heating system."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-pop-school-takes-nevada-desert/,Finnish pop up school takes over Nevada desert,"Who else but a group of Finns would build a pop up school for peer-teaching in the middle of the Nevada desert.  Every autumn the Black Rock desert in Nevada, USA, is transformed into the week-long festival ‘Burning Man’, celebrating art, community and self-expression. The core of the event is Black Rock City, a temporary metropolis of 75 000 participants (called ‘burners’) built just for the duration of the festival. This year one of its prime spots was taken over by Finnish educational project ‘ ’. “Burning Man is not your typical festival but a kind of a temporary society experiment,” says  , part of the project team. “At Koulu on Fire, burners were able to spread their learnings, knowledge and skills which fit well with the principles of the festival.” Run by a group of 20 volunteers (many of them from Finland’s Aalto University), the aim of Koulu on Fire is to make education accessible to everybody. The project is based on the ‘Koulu/School’ peer-learning concept developed by Finnish think tank Demos Helsinki in 2012. It is a simple and easy to disseminate teacher training system founded upon the idea that everybody has something to teach. “Behind the concept are various learning theories, including that people learn best from their peers,” Koivisto describes. During the Burning Man week, the Koulu/School concept was put into practice and Koulu on Fire offered thousands of people a first-hand experience with Finnish education expertise. A 120 square meter space in the desert was converted into a pop up school where anyone could learn to discover their inner teacher. The next step for Koulu on Fire is to take its peer-teaching method to refugee camps. Short teacher training workshops were used to help people find the thing they would could teach and learn the ‘Five Finger’ method of teaching. “In simplest terms it is based on a five finger rule,” Koivisto explains. “The hand is an easy cheat sheet we always have with us and every good lesson contains five elements around which it is easy for even an inexperienced teacher to build a class.” After learning these elements (activation, theorisation, motivation, creating dialogue and practical application), the new peer-teachers were helped to create their first classes. They were able to use the Koulu on Fire space to collaboratively create their own curriculum and teach classes based on their skill set and knowledge. “You do not have to be an expert in something to teach it. Instead it can be something you are really interested in or passionate about,” Koivisto says. “The class topics varied from bondage to healing a trauma. There was even one on Finnish sauna culture.” The Koulu on Fire space at Burning Man was created with limited resources using recycled local materials. This was to trial and tweak the concept so in future it could be easily set up anywhere in the world, particularly in areas of low infrastructure or temporary settlements where there is no access to formal education. Currently the project team is working with Finnish humanitarian assistance provider Finn Church Aid to see how Koulu on Fire could be used at refugee camps. “Later this year we might go in Nepal and then next year to refugee camps in Greece or Jordan,” says  , co-creator of the Koulu on Fire project. “We still need to do more planning and further hone the concept, but [Burning Man] will not be our last project.” But Koulu on Fire has an end to goal: to teach the Koulu/School method to as many people as possible so eventually the teaching method spreads organically. “We hope locals will adopt the method and we offer a tool kit they can use if it feels right for them,” Laurila explains. “The idea is not for us to teach it forever, but to get people excited about it and spread it to their peers.” The Koulu on Fire pop up school was built in the Nevada desert out of recycled materials. At the centre of the space rose the ‘tree of knowledge’ which took many hours and plenty of sweat to create."

How about inviting graffiti artists, surf-wear designers, illustrators, fine artists, tattooists, typographers and fashion designers to contribute designs which are digitally manifested via printing on-demand. “We’re three ex-advertising people who’d had enough of selling ideas to make children eat chocolate cereal,”  . “So we jumped from our day jobs to focus on the things we actually care about – art, big ideas, design, craft, having our socks knocked-off, originality and art [again].” Encompassing the entire flat and not limiting its interior design, this smart floor is targeted at elderly residents, using sensor technology to identify their location and movements. “The strong points of the system are automatic alarms and customisation, such as the possibility to adjust the sensitivity of the man-down alarm,”  . “The system also provides precise information concerning changes in the daily routines of the resident and assists in diagnosing illnesses.” Spatial design concepts, interior and exterior renderings, and product and catalogue visualisations are the order of the day for this company, via its photorealistic 3D renderings. “We combine interior design and digital technology in a way that the end result looks like a real photo,” founder    . “People can’t usually differentiate between a photo and our 3D rendering.” Housed in a similar domain, users of this platform can experiment with different pieces of furniture in different locations around a home via a 3D visualisation of furniture in an interior environment. “Our main customers are in the furniture industry,”  . “These are both manufacturers and retailers. In Finland we have all the major chains and in Sweden we have companies like EM.” Combining traditional craftsman quality with modern affordability, this company provides high-quality made-to-order doors and handles to fit Ikea cabinet frames. “We want to make design more democratic,”  . “A beautiful home should not depend on the thickness of your wallet.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-education-solutions-finland/,"Five for Friday: Education, part 1","Finnish education is the currently the talk of the town – all over the globe. This week we take a peek at some of the ways that Finland is broadening its scope of learning even further. Thanks to this Finnish-Russian company, robotics in the classroom are a thing of the present, enabling students to develop their coding skills. “Finland understands that this is the real skill that children will need in future,”  . “Personally, I haven’t been using things like algebra in real life since I finished school. But with programming, you can apply it right away.” It’s been quite the year for this Finnish education tech startup. A collaboration with Catholic Schools of Western Australia (CEWA) and Indian training and consultancy specialists Vinsys made headlines, but it was the deal inked with the United Nations that really got tongues wagging. “Claned is a great solution for collaborative learning and this agreement is yet another proof of the versatility of our platform,”  . In keeping with Finland’s ‘free education for all’ approach, this online platform allows instructors to create, share and teach courses without a single cent exchanging hands. “Access to education really should be our basic right, but it is true only for portion of humanity,”  . “We want to be a one-size-fits-all platform that doesn’t force you how to teach your course. Instead it just gives you enough flexibility and essential tools for teaching.” Helping lift smart devices out of students’ pockets and make them useful in the process, mobile application Flinga’s communal blackboard is seen as a tool for exporting Finnish expertise in education. “Flinga makes learning a shared activity,”  . “The teacher isn’t just preaching and pupils listening, but they can together add questions, photos, comments and whatnot onto Flinga.” A one-stop shop for textbooks, videos, assignments, educational exercises and a game, Keeduu seeks to cover all learning bases in the one concise and convenient digital package. “The response has been really good,”   in February. “Teachers like it; it’s easy for them to use. They don’t need separate clouds, for example, as there is everything in the one app. Children love it; they find it easy to learn.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kotkamills-shows-best-things-come-recyclable-packages/,Kotkamills shows that best things come in recyclable packages,"This Finnish company wants to tackle the growing piles of disposable dishes that are increasingly littering the horizon. Think about all the festivals you have ever attended. After the final band left the stage, and the crowd started shuffling home, inevitably their path is paved by a thick layer of discarded plastic pints and single-use plates unceremoniously left on the festival ground during the revelry. The carton board with barrier properties can be used for the likes of coffee cups. Of course this scenario is not confined to festive gatherings. How many disposable coffee cups turn into litter and waste during every day in any given major city? Thankfully, this mounting problem is being solved with an innovative approach in the eastern Finnish city of Kotka.  has recently developed a water-based dispersion solution that could be used to create fully recyclable virgin fibre based carton board suitable for food packaging. The end result resists the rigours of water, heat, grease and alcohol and can be recycled like paper or composted. “If all goes well, in the future we will only be producing recyclable food service board,” states company CEO  . “It’s a growing and profitable business.” This breakthrough represents another stage in the company’s long and eventful history. Kotkamills was founded in 1872 on Kotkansaari island as Finland’s most modern steam-powered sawmill. Subsequent decades have seen the company mine the deep well of Finnish forestry knowhow, before the factory landed a new owner in March 2015 and received over 100 million euros in investments. With Hämäläinen at the helm, Kotkamills set out to transform its approach from a printing paper machine to producing folding boxboard and food service board. CEO Markku Hämäläinen is leading Kotkamills to a sustainable future. “The thought of being capable of producing an eco-friendly product customers had been asking for, for so long, convinced investors,” Hämäläinen tells. Hämäläinen says the technology itself isn’t particularly new. So, why can Kotkamills do something others haven’t been keen on trying? “The reason is probably simple: machinery,” he admits. “The carton board with barrier properties needs several layers of the material, which means the paper machine needs to be dozens of metres longer than usual. Very few facilities have the room to extend their production facilities like this, but in Kotka it was possible.” The technology has understandably caught the eye of the big food chains. Yet, as the approval processes of these companies is so lengthy, Kotkamills decided to produce folding boxboard to keep its machines running whilst its food service board materials are developed further. Nonetheless, Hämäläinen hopes to see its eco-friendly alternative for plastic eventually take over the production completely. Others think so, too:   chose Kotkamills on its list of the most interesting companies contributing to circular economy. Elsewhere, Finnish Huhtamäki   a paper cup made entirely from plant-based materials. It isn’t only for the goodwill of food producers that Kotkamills wants to make packaging more sustainable. Hämäläinen believes that consumers are increasingly aware and demanding when it comes to their ecological footprint. A lot of people would prefer buying their lunch salad in a box they can recycle between newspapers to throwing a plastic container into a bin. Although the material is compostable, Hämäläinen would prefer seeing the virgin fibre back in use over and over again. When composted, the fibre will disappear, whereas when recycled with paper, the same fibre can be used to make paper for up to six times. This has particular relevance for fast food restaurants, where packaging materials containing plastic are a big problem that brings about expenses. Manufacturing packaging using Kotkamills’ material could turn this upside down significantly. “When restaurants now have to pay for someone to pick up their waste, they could instead sell the recyclable materials,” Hämäläinen explains. And so, looking ahead to festivals of the future, the path home might still be paved with discarded pints and plates; but instead of trash, they’ll be raw material for something new. Big packaging manufacturers could make use of Kotkamills’ product not only in food retail, but also in pet food and detergent containers."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/23136/,Supermetrics brings efficiency to business analytics,"Not many startups can say they have thousands of global customers globally and day one profitability, but Finnish analytics software specialist Supermetrics ticks both boxes.  Collecting online data is increasingly important for companies, but managing its many different sources from online advertising and social media to website traffic, is time consuming. Helsinki-based   has developed an easy way to tackle this: aggregate all the data into a single service. “Our solution saves time as you do not have to log into different services the check the data, everything is collected into a one view,” explains founder  . So how does this work? Supermetrics’ data collection tools tap into selected online services (such as Google, Facebook and YouTube), pull the data to either Excel or Google Sheets and turn them into a business reporting system for web analytics, social media and online marketing. All information updates automatically and visualisations and reports are easy to create. The tools are free to trial after which there is a monthly subscription fee. While many rival services offer predefined data sets and visual dashboards, Thuneberg says the strength of Supermetrics is the scope of data it provides. “We bring in the raw data and our customers can spin it anyway they want, it is a very flexible tool. If you want in-depth access to the data, you have it. You can decide exactly what you want,” he argues. “A couple of companies are doing something similar, but I would say we are the strongest player in this market.” So far this sales pitch has convinced thousands of companies around the world (including Dyson, Greenpeace and BBC Worldwide) to sign up and almost 35 per cent of Supermetrics’ clients are based in the USA. Pictured left to right are Dawit Nida, Harri Lampi, Zhao Hanbo, Mikael Thuneberg, Clinton Deacon and Minh Hoang. Supermetrics was born from Thuneberg’s own frustrations with data collection. Seven years ago he was working at Sulake (creator of online community Habbo Hotel) and in charge of reporting data from 20 different country editions of Habbo. “It was very time-consuming, a lot of copy-pasting, and frankly felt like a fool’s errand,” Thuneberg recalls. “I thought this should be automatised. I do not have a background in programming, but I created a few simple automation scripts and shared them online for free.” This caught the eye of some people in the Google Analytics team who highlighted the scripts as the best solution for accessing Analytics from Excel. As a result, Thuneberg was flooded by messages from interested users and six months later (early 2010) he started a one-man operation to develop analytics tools. As demand grew Thuneberg decided it was time to think bigger. Supermetrics was born in 2013 and today has six employees in Helsinki. The company has been profitable from the day one and built a global clientele entirely through word of mouth. For this Thuneberg gives a big nod to an influential supporter. “People in the Google Analytics team have been excited by our tools and blogged about us often. I have also invited to present to their biggest advertisers at annual Google Analytics conferences,” he explains. “This visibility has been a huge help.” Supermetrics is now looking to expand its team and introduce new tools. A key addition will enable direct data import to user’s own data warehouses, something the startup is now testing with one of Finland’s biggest media agencies. “[Our aim] is to become a service that brings together all possible data sources and combines them with all the places where data is used,” Thuneberg says. He admits he has come a long way from starting a software company without any previous entrepreneurial or even programming experience, but only speaks highly of his experiences so far: “I never thought I would become an entrepreneur. I made all sorts of silly mistakes at the start and it has been a great learning experience. But I would recommend entrepreneurship to anyone.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-breaks-new-ground-eco-friendly-icebreaker/,Finland breaks new ground with eco-friendly icebreaker,"With 1 100 kilometres of coastline and winter temperatures which can plummet below -30, it is not surprising Finland is known for its icebreaker expertise. This knowhow is now showcased in Polaris, the world’s most environmentally friendly icebreaker. Polaris is the first new icebreaker to be launched in Finland since 1998. Commissioned by the   (TFA) and owned by the state-controlled  , Polaris has been a four-year long project tapping into the expertise of various Finnish companies. The result is the world’s first icebreaker powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which significantly reduces carbon emissions. Alongside the technological achievements that the ship represents, it is also making a splash for its timely arrival. Polaris is ready to start operations in early 2017, just in time for Finland’s centenary of independence. With the theme for Finland’s centenary year being “Together”, the project stands as an excellent example of what is possible when Finnish knowhow comes together for a common, innovative goal. In keeping with this spirit of collaboration,   talked with three of the companies that have contributed to making Polaris.  fingerprints can found on over 60 per cent of the world’s icebreakers. The Helsinki-based company was part of the Polaris project from the beginning, first consulting on early planning and later taking charge of the vessel’s conceptual design with support from FTA and another Finnish marine engineering specialist,  . “This is a typical role for our company,” says managing director  . “We create new concepts, new ideas, develop new technologies and use them in technologically advanced vessels.” Polaris fits the bill as the most environmentally friendly diesel-electric icebreaker to date. A key part of this are its low emissions thanks to the capability of using both LNG and ultra-low sulphur diesel. “[In addition] we were able to reduce Polaris’ ice resistance and consequently its energy consumption by 40 per cent compared to older icebreakers,” Suojanen explains. “We achieved this through technical improvements, [a new kind of] propulsion system, material choices and hull design.” Aker Arctic is as busy as ever since the conclusion of the Polaris project. Notably it is designing icebreakers and ice-going vessels in France, China and Russia as well as working on a potential major project in the US.

Aker Arctic’s partner in creating this design was Turku-based  . “All major decisions were done together, but all features regarding multi-purpose operations, such as open water functions, emergency towing and model testing in open water were our domain and Aker handled the icebreaking side,” explains  , managing director at ILS. ILS has been designing icebreaking vessels (including the world’s first multi-purpose icebreaker) for almost 30 years. Lehtonen laughs as he explains customers always have impossibly high requirements – and Polaris was no exception. “The order was to make a better icebreaker than any previous ones and one which is also capable of open water operations,” Lehtonen says. In addition, TFA wanted this powerful icebreaker to produce practically zero emissions, but the teams pulled it off with LNG. It is a great reference for the 16-person company and ILS is gathering speed as a result with multiple global design projects on its books. Aside from icebreaking, Polaris can perform emergency towing, rescue operations and oil spill response operations all year round. Its in-built oil recovery system was provided by Finnish environmental solutions specialists  . The system also includes a storm boom, which even enables oil recovery in rough seas, as the vessel can be operated sideways. In this unique application model the vessel stifles the majority of waves making it possible to recover oil from the water surface. “It is quite unique for an icebreaker to have an oil recovery system, particularly an in-built one,” enthuses  , COO at Lamor. “This is the first one for an icebreaker of this level. The equipment has all the necessary heating systems to ensure it is fully operational in Arctic conditions and temperatures.” Lamor has developed a wide range of oil spill response and recovery equipment and services, but its Arctic knowhow is where the company believes it is significantly ahead of its competitors, and why it likes to target these regions. “Our biggest projects are currently in the Arctic region of Russia,” Högstrom says. “Furthermore we do oil spill response as a service and there is a lot of demand for this in South-America. In total, we handle around 300 projects per year.” But for all this internationalism the Polaris project is what remains most dear to all three companies because it stands as a Finnish showpiece. “All the significant elements in Polaris come from Finland, including the dual-fuel engines, propulsion units, building and design,” Suojanen says. “Finland is clearly the leading country when it comes to designing and building icebreakers.” Polaris, the world’s first LNG powered icebreaker, has been designed and constructed entirely in Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/emfit-reads-your-sleep-loud-and-clear/,Emfit reads your sleep loud and clear,"This Finnish company’s sensors analyse sleep effortlessly for a healthier life. Remember the fairy tale about the princess with the pea under her mattress? In the story, the pea ended up in a museum – and that is where it belongs, as its place in the bed can now be taken by a measurement sensor developed by the Finnish company   hoping to slip one under every mattress by the late 2020s. These sleep fairies are not just daydreamers: their sensors are already sold across the globe. While the Emfit QS sensor may not reveal a princess like the pea did, its numerous features can help people sleep their way to feeling like kings and queens, bed size aside. “Using it is easy: you place the sensor crosswise under your mattress, under the area where your heart is whilst sleeping,” says Emfit CEO  . “The sensor registers things such as your breathing, heart rate and even heart-rate-variability in real-time as well as your motion in bed.” The data is also transmitted to the cloud for further use, and with the Wi-Fi or mobile data connectivity, users such as elderly persons do not need any certain terminal device on them. Physiological sleep research has attracted major interest over the past years. Emfit has been involved since 1991 by developing purpose-specific technology. “Our bed sensors have been commercially available for over 15 years, and more and more people globally are finding Emfit’s solutions helpful in improving the quality of their life through measured sleep data”, Räisänen states. Some findings can be crucial, as in the case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common type of sleep apnea typically resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness plus functionality and memory problems. The most serious consequence of untreated OSA is to the heart. Persons with sleep apnea have a 30 per cent higher risk of heart attack or death than those unaffected. “OSA is a serious matter and an underdiagnosed one as well,” Räisänen explains. “We at Emfit currently put in a lot of work related to OSA as well as IRR, Increased Respiratory Resistance. Our unique sensor is in the pipeline for official registration under the Medical Device Directive to be used by doctors making OSA diagnoses, expected in the second half of 2017. This seeks to facilitate a quicker and easier discovery of OSA than before, which can translate into prevention of many other ailments such as strokes in OSA patients. Sports-minded people also benefit from Emfit QS. A good number of top athletes globally already rely on it. “With our algorithms, we can calculate heart rate variability (HRV) from sensor signal,” Räisänen says. Emfit QS-based HRV measurements during sleep provide athletes and coaches with information on recovery and recent physical strain, to assist in the planning of training. “For example, close to 400 NFL players are currently using our sensors through a specialist sleep coaching company, RiseScience,” Räisänen says. “Triathletes, bicyclists ,as well as exercise-minded laypersons are exploiting Emfit QS data gathered during sleep to know when they can go all out and when to rest.” Räisänen practices what he preaches. “There was a time when I sacrificed sleep on account of work for too long, until my body couldn’t take it anymore,” he says. “I learned the vital importance of sleep the hard way. Today, with our own products, I am able to maintain better resting habits.” By way of collaboration with mattress makers, Emfit wants their sensor in connection with every decent mattress sold in the future. Then more of us would get a better idea of our sleep just by turning in. The sensor registers things such as breathing, heart rate and even heart-rate-variability in real-time, as well as motion in bed."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/industryhack-disrupts-businesses-within/,Industryhack disrupts businesses from within,"Startups have the ideas and agility corporations need to keep up with tomorrow’s world. Through Finnish Industryhack, industry leaders open their doors and data to tech companies and startups, who then do their best to show what could be done more and better. Ever tried figuring out why your TV remote isn’t working or why your bike is acting up? Then a friend walks in and spots what’s wrong – in a heartbeat. Often an outsider, with no fixed patterns regarding how things should and shouldn’t be done, can offer useful insights – provided he or she understands the matter in question. Finnish   is based on this very idea: it brings together established large corporations from traditional industries and top teams from technology companies that can shake and stir them with disruptive ideas and innovative solutions. , Industryhack CEO, used to work at  , where he saw small startups come up with big things all the time. With this experience in his back pocket, two years ago he took part in a public discussion, where participants were contemplating how to push Finland to the forefront of the Internet of Things (IoT). “I felt like everything focused on producing reports and organising seminars and sending suggestions to the government,” he says now. “I’m not against reports and surveys; however, I felt like more actual action was needed.” Another important aspect, in Vilén eyes, was to make IoT attractive to innovators themselves. “Developers can choose to go work in sexier fields, such as gaming or mobile apps, so things like waste management or water pumps need to be rendered appealing to top talents.” Right there and then, Vilén suggested giving a bunch of developers access to APIs (application programming interface) and a weekend to come up with innovative solutions. That was the opening shot for Industryhack. Since the beginning of 2015, Industryhack has collaborated with various large corporations and almost 300 teams in facilitating hackathons and open innovation challenges. According to Vilén, Industryhack is continuously developing its product together with its customers. He points out that all businesses, regardless of their field, will have to start leaning on software and analytics to stay in tune with the world. That’s where Industryhack and its innovation task force, as Vilén calls it, step in to the rescue. “Companies realise they lack the expertise to innovate new practices, but they know their current systems inside out. When we bring along outsiders with technological skills, we promise to deliver approximately six prototypes or pilots within the space of three months.” The four founders: Mikael Hautala (left), Pekka Sivonen, Petri Vilén and Ville Riikkala. An example of a hackathon could be an energy company opening the APIs of their water turbines to developers and letting them figure out how to better control them remotely, or how to spot potential malfunctions quicker and more accurately than before. Then they create new, disruptive solutions, building on top of the company’s pre-existing platforms. Normally the participating teams get to know the company and its industry in the beginning of the challenge on a company excursion. The two- to three-day hackathon is where the magic happens. At the end of the challenge, final demos are presented to the experts, customers and decision-makers of the company for their consideration. The goal is to see at least one to three projects taken further. Sometimes all participants are paid a reward, and sometimes the teams are competing for a significant sum of money. The biggest incentive lies further in the future. “Most of the companies are motivated, because there’s a prospect of continuing collaboration. Even if they don’t win a deal in the end, they’ll have learned a lot about the industry and expanded their networks,” Vilén explains. There’s no worries of ideas getting stolen, either. Industryhack makes sure that the IPR developed during the innovation challenges stay in the hands of their makers. Initially Industryhack was started by four people. Now the company team consists of three founders, Vilén included, and a staff of five. The company is funded mostly by its customers, together with funding for product and community development from partners Samsung and IBM and Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation  . In Finland, Industryhack has served customers such as Konecranes, Fazer, Rolls-Royce and the City of Helsinki. In November, Industryhack organised its first challenge in Germany, hosted by  , and next year some Swedish companies will be on the hacking list. Sooner or later Industryhackers will be exploring further afield, but Vilén says that first Industryhack is testing the waters from Finland. Opening offices outside of the motherland might be on the cards, but there’s no immediate rush. Hopefully one day the methods cultivated by Industryhack will be business as usual across various industries. “Open innovations and digitalisation are universal phenomena. In small countries like Finland, industrywide changes can happen very rapidly when needed,” Vilén points out. At the same time, Industryhack offers Finnish startups an excellent opportunity for growth and internationalisation. The hackathon in Germany saw six Finnish teams travel to Hamburg together with Industryhack. There’s plenty more talent in the pool to scoop from. Vilén describes Finland as a very fertile soil for new innovations and ventures. He should know – he’s been an entrepreneur since the age of 15, and he started learning coding when he was just eight years old. “Right now, I feel like Finland’s mindset is really open for renewals and innovations,” he states. Things are moving and will move even further in the coming years. We might not have as much as money as Silicon Valley, but we’ve got the mood for making things happen.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tinder-meets-airbnb-fashion-app-ivalo/,Tinder meets Airbnb with fashion app IVALO,"Fashion is a three trillion-US dollar global market which is dominated by major brands. But if you are looking for something more individual, Finnish startup IVALO has found a way to bring new designers straight to your fingertips. On paper IVALO sounds like every fashion lover’s dream. Instead of competing with big brand retailers, the mobile app is a treasure trove of independent and up-and-coming designers wrapped in an intuitive user experience. IVALO has a Tinder-like user interface. Swipe right to buy a product, left to see more. “IVALO is a curated fashion marketplace and all the brands are handed-picked by us. You can find designers you will not see anywhere else,” says  , Founder and CEO of IVALO. “If you use startup lingo then IVALO is the Tinder of Fashion with the monetisation model of AirBnB.” Users can choose which brands or product groups they want to explore, then browse through them on their phones. You swipe right to buy a piece of clothing or an accessory and the transaction is completed with a few taps or swipe left to see more products. For designers, IVALO offers an easy access to a new mobile sales channel and all purchases are shipped by the designers themselves, so there are no setup costs or monthly fees. IVALO takes a 20 per cent commission on items bought through the app. “There is practically no risk for the designers, they just spend an hour or two adding their products into the app,” Lamminsalo explains. “Over 90 per cent of the designers we have approached have wanted to try the service.” IVALO has been well received since it launched in Finland in October and already claims to be the world’s biggest marketplace for Finnish fashion with over 80 brands (such as IvanaHelsinki, Lumi and Terhi Pölkki) in its marketplace. While Lamminsalo is not a newcomer to the startup world, IVALO is his first step into the fashion industry. The idea for a Tinder-like marketplace stemmed from Lamminsalo’s own fashion designer friends who complained how difficult it is get their foot in the door. Intrigued, he started to research the topic. “We interviewed 50 designers and found they are artists by heart and love creating fashion, but are often bad at selling and marketing themselves,” Lamminsalo says with a laugh. “At the same time the trend is towards people wanting to buy products from small, indie brands.” Currently the IVALO app showcases products from over 80 Finnish fashion brands. Add to the mix the growth of online fashion sales, particularly on mobile devices, and Lamminsalo saw the opportunity to the start developing IVALO in early 2016. Now the startup has a five-member team and 150 000 euros in funding to drive the app forward. Lamminsalo is happy with IVALO’s launch so far and says the app has been downloaded over five thousand times in its first five weeks. But Finland is only a springboard for the service, which aims to launch on the wider European market in early 2017. “Finns on average spend very little money on clothes compared to the rest of Europe, so Finland is purely a test market for us,” Lamminsalo explains. He has already gauged international demand by visiting fashion weeks in Paris, Madrid, London and Copenhagen and IVALO’s ambitions are high: “We currently have 100 international designers waiting for the service to launch in Europe.” Lamminsalo says. “IVALO has only one goal that in five years’ time it will be the world’s leading service for product sales from independent brands.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-enthusiasm-for-mma-can-t-be-caged/,Finland’s enthusiasm for MMA cannot be caged,"The sport that pits two fighters with mixed martial arts experience against one another is taking the world by storm. Now the European Fighting Challenge from Finland is setting out to conquer Europe by bringing it together under the one banner. After Swede   (198 cm, 114.1 kg) walked into a room full of people and began staring down Brazilian   (190 cm, 107.9 kg), a shove and a kick between the two heavyweights saw the situation close to spiraling out of control. Luckily one man was on hand to try and deescalate the rising tension at the weigh-in: EuroFC CEO  . “It was an experience I cannot say I’m never going to forget because everything happened so quickly,” Kukila recalls with a laugh. “When it happened I just jumped in.” Thanks to Kukila’s quick thinking, the two heavyweight MMA fighters would go on to later face each other inside a cage as planned at the first  , held on 1 October at the Metro Areena in Espoo, Finland. And this was just one of many showdowns. There were eight more fights booked for the  , with four Finnish MMA fighters involved, including local veteran   making a successful comeback in the headline fight of the evening. An experienced sports marketer with a past in the Finnish Olympic Committee and with Adidas, Kukila jumped at the chance to create the first all-European MMA promotion. Our mission is to grow the market and make this sport more easily approachable to all. “We did quite a bit of research last year regarding the European market and found out that the European market is very fragmented when it comes to MMA promotions,” Kukila explains. The problem, Kukila says, is that many European countries have their own local promotions but the continent lacks a primary promoter that represents European MMA as a whole. “If you like to put it into the perspective of bigger sports, it’s kind of like the Champions League is missing from Europe,” Kukila points out. “We’re talking about approximately a 200 million-US dollar opportunity in Europe.” MMA has burst into the mainstream in recent years, following the success of its most famous promotion, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). By building an incredible hype around its events, with the help of social media, traditional marketing channels and brash superstar fighters, the UFC has been able to attract tens of thousands of people to its events and millions more who watch them through pay-per-view channels worldwide. It was sold as the most expensive brand in sports history for four billion dollars last fall. Now EuroFC is looking to do something similar in Europe. “We call it the new breed or the new era,” Kukila says. “Our mission is to grow the market and make this sport more easily approachable to all. That means that we are eventually building an entertainment brand and not only an MMA organisation.” “Our target is to be the European market leader,” he declares, without missing a beat. To ensure the top quality of each event, EuroFC has teamed up with  , who’s been involved with MMA for the past 12 years, first as a journalist and then as a talent representative bringing European stars to the UFC. Now the established German brings in top fighters to EuroFC, finds the rising stars and most importantly involves the local heroes in each host country to make the events as attractive as possible across Europe. Looking ahead, EuroFC will organise five events around Europe next year, with 10 more planned for 2018. “The story continues,” Kukila says. “It has only started and our next event will be in Prague in February and the third one which is announced too will be in May in Copenhagen. So yeah, we have only started.”"

With a chunky financial boost coming just as the year was drawing to a close, this US-based company with Finnish roots is set to go to the second-hand clothing stratosphere. “There’s a staggering amount of unused, pre-owned merchandise with an estimated value of more than 100 billion dollars annually,”  . What better way for this online analytics company to expand its horizons, than to do so with a huge capital injection. “The media landscape has become increasingly complex with consumers accessing content across multiple screens and devices,”  . “Verto has deep expertise in cross-device audience measurement, and provides the most compelling solution for publishers, brands and advertisers to more effectively measure today’s consumer.” Rounding out the top five Finnish money magnets in 2016, the quartet of mobile games developer  , food delivery service  , open mobile operating system Sailfish OS developer   and “Internet Anywhere” technology pioneer   each landed funding rounds of 10 million euros."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wello2-breathes-fresh-air-respiratory-training/,WellO2 breathes fresh air into respiratory training,"Everybody should train their respiratory muscles, believes Hapella, a Finnish startup which promises benefits for asthmatics, athletes and couch potatoes alike, or even someone suffering from a cold. Behind Hapella’s claim is its   wellness device for respiratory training which was launched in Finland last month. Its patented method combines resistive breathing and warm vapour inhalation to support better and more efficient breathing. “When you blow into the device, the resistance created opens up your airways so when you inhale the warm vapour it gets deeper into your airways,” explains Happella CEO  . “This combination opens up your airways and clears mucus, while breathing against resistance trains the respiratory muscles.” Hapella believes this can help not only those with acute or chronic breathing difficulties, but also shallow breathers, snorers, the elderly and even athletes by increasing chest mobility, lung capacity and enhancing blood circulation. Hapella backs this up with test results which found shallow breathers were able to improve their exhaling and inhaling strength by up to 30 per cent after a few weeks of respiratory training. WellO2 stems from the personal experiences of its creator  , who has battled respiratory difficulties and asthma all his life. Kärkkäinen had always found the steam in a sauna relieves his condition, but it was not until 2010 when he tried resistive breathing that it dawned on him what a powerful effect combining the two could have. At first Kärkkäinen built a prototype device for his personal use, but soon realised its commercial potential. And he was not alone. Among the people convinced by the concept was Kuronen, who left a career at the Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment to help found Hapella in July 2014. “We closed our funding round [of 1.5 million euros] in a few months and we could not even take in everyone who was interested,” Kuronen recalls. “WellO2 is a simple innovation in the sense that it is easy to understand and it has been created by a user. People saw its potential very quickly.” At first, Hapella focused purely on the treatment side of WellO2 device, but soon realised it had training potential as well. Both the device’s temperature and breathing resistance are adjustable, which means the training load can be adapted to anyone. “Think of a family with kids. The kids get at cold a few times a year and WellO2 is great for clearing their airways,” says Kuronen. “If there is a singer in the family, it can be used to open up and treat their voice and it also helps dad with asthma and grandad with pulmonary disease.” WellO2 started well in Finland, with 2 000 units sold in its first two weeks. And Hapella believes demand will only grow. “We talked with big healthcare device manufacturers when researching the market and they said the number of respiratory problems will explode in future,” Kuronen explains. “Still there has not been any real innovation in the sector for 20 years, until now.” Hapella is already negotiating with potential distribution partners outside Finland and plans to launch WellO2 across the Nordics and German-speaking countries in 2017. At the same time the startup is investing in product development and working with medical professionals to research the potential benefits of WellO2 in preventing colds, easing sleep apnea and even supporting recovery from a stroke. “We want to create various products and services around respiratory wellness. The aim is to also add advisory services where doctors can offer help and advice to our customers,” Kuronen says. “Our vision is to build WellO2 into an internationally recognised brand.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lightneer-game-future-learning/,Lightneer is game for future learning,"Finnish Lightneer doesn’t want to develop the best learning games in the world; it wants to compete with all games, and help players learn on the side. You wouldn’t think particle physics to be a subject that fascinates four-year-olds. Well, Finnish game studio   is on course to change this. Whilst its first-ever game,  , is simple enough for small children to grasp, by no means is it restricted to toddlers’ playrooms. “I went to introduce the game to a class of fourth-graders,” says  , Lightneer CEO and co-founders. “In the beginning, I asked the group of 25 pupils if they knew what atoms are, and two raised their hands. After less than an hour of  , all hands were up.” In  , players collect quarks, create protons and build atoms. The entire periodic table is rendered to Pokémon-style collectible characters – which, as has been seen, appeals to all age groups. Whilst playing the game, the player will almost by accident gain knowledge and understanding regarding topics traditionally deemed complex and difficult. What products can be used to make an ice hockey stick more durable, and how? Why do helium balloons float in the air? “Our dream is to one day see a four-year-old, a 54-year-old and a 94-year-old learn physics like this,” Järvilehto notes. Another dream is to see Lightneer games high up on the list of the world’s most popular games. Not just learning games – any games. Learning is a side product of entertainment. Lightneer CEO Lauri Järvilehto The story of Lightneer boils down to Rovio, where Järvilehto previously worked as a consultant. When his team eventually dissolved, the innovations they had been working on felt too good to be buried. It was a close call, though; Järvilehto was about to move to New York when he started chatting about his ideas with other mobile gaming veterans. “I realised that although opportunities arise all the time, this is something that’ll bother me for the rest of my life if I didn’t follow through with it,” he recalls. Lightneer founding fathers managed to find a group of investors passionate about learning. So is the team, now consisting of over a dozen employees and a handful of freelancers. “We’ve been outrageously lucky in our recruiting,” he says. “Everyone is not only top notch in their field, but also get along with others like a house on fire. Despite our high ambition levels, we’ve got good vibrations all over.” CERN’s head of global outreach,  , is a great addition to the team as a scientific advisor. He, together with Finnish professor  , makes sure that all things go according to the laws of physics. Landua has plenty of experience in popularising science: he’s spent a lot of time behind the scenes in Hollywood, including for the film  , to make sure there are no errors in the film’s antimatter science. “In certain things we’ve taken artistic liberties to keep the game interesting, but underneath the surface there’s a lot of hard-core expertise in physics,” Järvilehto states.  keeps growing in features, and it’ll be accompanied by an animated series, now in production, that will dig deeper into lessons of the game. Järvilehto mentions the possibility of creating textbooks including characters familiar from the game. Lightneer is often asked if the game is meant for children and schools. No, says Järvilehto: the target audience is simply gamers. Again, Lightneer games aren’t played only for the sake of learning, but for fun above anything else. Lightneer is already planning its second game, which is also related to physics and chemistry. At some point the company could take a break from science and jump into something else, such as languages. “A lot of companies are fighting for getting everyone on the planet online, but what do you do with the Internet if you can’t read?” Järvilehto asks. “Creating a game that would teach all children in developing countries to read and basic English skills is a hugely intriguing idea.” The game was soft launched at Slush in November, and became available soon after in the Philippines. Next year it’ll travel across the world, as there are ongoing negotiations with partners in different corners of the world, including the vast and populous China. There’ll be no global launch; instead, Lightneer wants to go and launch the game in one country at a time. This spells plenty of boarding passes and flight miles for Lightneer in future – and a lot of fascinated four-year-olds."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/underhood-gets-grips-online-reputation/,Underhood gets to grips with your online reputation,"Using an innovative, automated system, Underhood helps companies and brands to get a handle on their social media efforts.   It’s baffling that many companies still treat social media as a one-way communication channel, rather than actively engaging with their audience. It’s not only a question of image – it has concrete impact on their bottom line. This is the message of  , a Finnish company that “allows firms and brands to see how well they are performing on the Internet and helps them step up their social media game,” says co-founder . “Many still use the Internet for basically issuing press releases, and do not participate in the conversation around the company.” In the digital era, a company’s social media activity and dialogue with its audience are critical elements of how reputation is built and maintained. “There is a growing understanding that reputation is absolutely crucial for any company,” says Kuusela. “Some say that reputation is the single most important factor in the success of a firm.” “Reputation doesn’t happen on its own but takes a lot of effort,” states co-founder Sami Kuusela. Underhood’s algorithm, developed in-house, assesses reputation based on three criteria that examine firms’ social media presence: similarity (how similar the language of the company and its audience is), dialogue (how engaged and reactive the company is) and visibility (how well-known the company is). The whole process is entirely automatic, producing a detailed report that lets companies see how effective they are on social media, and where they should make additional effort. “Online, we can see immediately the reactions and exchanges on a company’s Facebook and Twitter accounts,” Kuusela says. “Our system can’t be tricked, as it measures people’s actual, genuine behaviour online” Underhood releases plenty of information for free, but for a monthly fee, historical data and further comparisons and reports are also available. Rather ingeniously, anyone can see how companies score on Underhood. “It’s an additional incentive to take this stuff seriously: everyone can see how well you are doing. Even if you didn’t yourself check your score, you can be sure that your competitors will,” Kuusela says. The company is also transparent about its analytical methodology, which has allowed Underhood to partner with researchers interested in reputation analysis. The company may be young (it launched its beta version in July), but Underhood has already received significant endorsements. In February, it landed an investment of 100 000 euros from Asiakastieto, a company that provides corporate, risk management, and sales and marketing information services. And, in November, it raised roughly the same amount from a group of angel investors. To expand from social media, the firm is already looking at using other sources of data to measure reputation, such as news media articles. But in the long run Underhood aims to develop even more comprehensive tools that allow extrapolating how companies are performing generally based on various data sources, using a method called “nowcasting”. When I ask Kuusela about Underhood’s own score on its platform, the response is delightfully frank: “It’s crappy, but that’s how it should be since we’ve just entered the scene, and there’s little buzz around us yet. Reputation doesn’t happen on its own but takes a lot of effort.” Underhood releases plenty of information for free, but for a monthly fee, historical data and further comparisons and reports are also available."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-popular-articles-2016/,Five for Friday: Our most popular articles in 2016,"Many things have been happening in 2016 for Good News from Finland, least of all we have enjoyed a significant boost in our readership. So, among the groundbreaking innovations, exciting startups and investment news we’ve reported on these past 12 months, are you wondering what has been checked out the most? Rather than focus their creative energies on one game or book,   decided to emulate the likes of Marvel, DC Comics and Star Wars and create a universe. Or, in industry terms, intellectual property (IP), that would encompass characters, stories, names, places and the brand itself. “The name is ironic,”  admitted to us, laughingly. “It’s a safety valve as well. We can do stupid stuff, because we don’t call ourselves stupid for nothing.” Born out of frustration with unreliable, insecure video calling services,   believes it has found a better way to keep in touch with family and friends abroad. “Zyptonite is the first real-time communications app that connects parties directly,” explained co-founder and CEO . “People need a simple, reliable and free video call and messenger service that works on different devices and operating systems without problems.” With a mere 2 700 employees, Finland’s games industry generated a turnover of almost 2.5 billion euros in 2015. Wondering what the secret to its success has been? “We share information, knowledge and networks,” states  , director of local games hub  . “Since we don’t have a domestic market and all our companies get more revenue from export markets abroad, it makes sense for Finnish game developers to cooperate inside Finland.” The brainchild of three teachers, schools around the world are increasingly harnessing  ’s solutions. Even more so since American multinational tech giant   the company’s   educational game in January. “Our greatest challenge is to make sure that the games don’t reek of school,” outlined CEO  . Such is the capability of tech company  , its CEO and founder  is confident that within five years Umbra will be at the forefront of providing 3D rendering, not only video games but for everyday life too. “Since we’ve already been working on it [VR] for the last 15 years, it hasn’t shown signs of dying out,” Mäkinen says. “Also, there is more and more content all the time, and we are about to optimise all of that.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/paptic-revolutionary-replacement-bag/,Paptic has a revolutionary replacement in the bag,"This Finnish startup aims to substitute plastic bags with a new material based on wood-fibre. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a gigantic region where plastics and other debris have been caught in ocean currents. The Pacific isn’t alone, either: this is happening around the world. The problem is that plastic is so convenient that it is hard to stop using it, even though it is bad for the environment. Now, though, a Finnish company might have a solution.  has patented a revolutionary new fibre product with properties like plastic. It mainly consists of wood fibre but isn’t like paper. It is lighter, more durable and even stretches. “The business idea of Paptic was originally established as a response to the banning of plastic bags in numerous countries,” explains CEO  . “We wanted to provide an alternative to plastics: the wood-based, recyclable and reusable Paptic material.” Plastics might break down, but they don’t degrade. Everyone has seen photos of dead sea turtles or albatrosses trapped in plastic, but it is not so easy to see the tiny pieces of plastic eaten by fish. Mustonen points to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that suggests by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans. A major cause is single-use plastic bags, which Paptic now seeks to replace. “The business idea of Paptic was originally established as a response to the banning of plastic bags in numerous countries,” explains CEO Tuomas Mustonen. “There are several other materials being proposed as sustainable alternatives to plastics. These include biodegradable plastics, biobased plastics and plastics which have renewable filler. However, most of the competing products are still plastics,” says Mustonen. “Paptic is the only material that successfully combines strength, pleasant usability, high quality appearance and sustainability.” The company was founded in 2015, but the research behind it has been going on for many years at the  . Paptic has received financing from the   and raised 1.1 million euros in venture capital. It has already run trials with its bags with major retailers such as  . “We launched over a half dozen bag campaigns with our partners during 2016,” Mustonen continues. “The feedback from our partners and especially the consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. The consumers like the product and they especially value the change away from plastic bags as a step towards a more sustainable planet.” About 100 billion plastic bags are used every year in Europe alone. Various ideas have been tried to lower their use, and some have had remarkable success. England introduced a five-pence charge on plastic bags late in 2015 and the number used dropped by 85 per cent. However, bags are only a part of the problem because plastics are used in many different applications. “The carrier bags are the first application for Paptic material, but we are already investigating a number of other applications,” says Mustonen. “We have investigated flexible packaging for non-food items such as toys and toiletries; shipping envelopes for e-commerce deliveries; and posters, banners and labels for graphic applications. The performance parameters of Paptic, such as flexibility and tear resistance, make it an attractive material for many uses.” Currently production of the Paptic material is limited by the capacity of the pilot plant in Espoo, but they are already planning for the future. Mustonen says they have begun working to increase their production capacity to industrial scale by mid-2018. Alongside bags, Paptic has investigated flexible packaging for non-food items such as toys and toiletries; shipping envelopes for e-commerce deliveries; and posters, banners and labels for graphic applications."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/flexound-helps-feel-music-like-never/,Flexound helps you feel music like never before,"Music can lift our spirits and help us relax. Now Finnish startup Flexound Systems takes this experience a step further by transforming sound into touch.   wants to change how we listen to music, watch movies and play games. Imagine sitting on your couch with a pillow behind your back and music not only filling your ears, but vibrating on your skin. This is Flexound’s patented ‘feelsound’ technology. It combines high-quality sound and distributed vibration to enable users to simultaneously feel and hear sounds and music. “Since sound films were introduced 100 years ago practically all entertainment has been designed for our eyes and ears only,” says CEO  . “Our technology adds a third sense, the sense of touch, to audio and digital entertainment and makes it a more immersive experience.” This was proved by Flexound’s first product, the ‘Taikofon’ therapy pillow, launched a year ago. Targeted at children with autism and other disabilities, it has found a user base with therapists around the world. A child can hug the pillow or lay on it and the combination of vibration and sound helps them to calm down, focus and relax. “When you listen to music, it releases dopamine in the brain which lowers your stress levels and makes you feel good,” Heinaro describes. “When you combine that with vibration which releases oxytocin, the ‘closeness hormone’, it has many nice effects such as increased relaxation and enjoyment.” The secret of Taikofon is a built-in unit that connects to any music source wirelessly via Bluetooth, makes sound waves resonate and distributes the vibrations across the pillow. This means a user can press their ear on the pillow and feel like they are surrounded by music without disturbing others around them. Behind feelsound is acoustics specialist  , who was introduced to the idea by his occupational therapist wife two years ago. “Feelsound technology creates your own sound island,” says Mervi Heinaro. “You feel the sounds on your body and skin, and not only the bass but also middle-frequencies.” When Linjama realised no one had done this before, he started building prototypes and in early 2015 founded Flexound with Heinaro and  . They started with a focus on the therapy market, but soon saw the potential of technology in digital entertainment. Now Flexound is preparing to launch its first real consumer product, the ‘HUMU Smart Cushion’. Designed more for adults’ taste than Taikofon, HUMU fits nicely behind the neck and connects to the audio source of the user’s choosing. “You can use HUMU with any audiovisual material whether its music, videos, games, movies or TV series. My mother uses it to listen to audio books,” Heinaro explains. “And HUMU is a good partner for effective relaxation. Even if you only have five minutes, you can achieve a kind of a trance by listening to music using HUMU.” While Flexound’s 10-person team is based in Espoo, Finland, the startup plans to launch HUMU first in China and on the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo in early 2017. “We have a preliminary agreement with a major Chinese retail chain that they will test market HUMU in their 200 flagship stores. If that goes well, HUMU will be stocked in all of its 1 500 stores,” Heinaro enthuses. And the ambitions of Flexound are not limited to its own products. The startup sees major potential in licensing its technology to be integrated into everything from car and movie theatre seats to spa tables and even dentist chairs. In fact, a few prototypes are already on the way. “Our strategic goal is to have multiple licensing partners and over 200 million euros in revenue by 2020,” says Heinaro. “It is an ambitious goal, but our board members consider their calculations conservative and we believe them.” Flexound wants to be seen, heard and – most importantly – felt. One characteristic of feelsound technology is that because it is close to your skin and body, the music volume can be kept low"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-working-wonders-waste/,Five for Friday: Working wonders with waste,"With what to do with waste being such a hot topic globally, this week we take a look at innovative solutions from Finland for what’s left behind. Since 1991, this company has been providing its semi-underground Deep Collection waste containers to a global customer base. The simple yet effective design of the Molok storage containers mean that around 60 per cent of each container is located below ground, taking up less space and serving another important purpose. “Because of the coolness of the ground, there are no problems with odour,”    , controller, Global Activities at Molok, also pointing to the effectiveness of having a black lid firmly capping the container. “When the sun hits the lid, the waste also dries and then there is no smell.” The Zen Robotics Recycler reduces waste processing costs and increases recycling efficiency, using smart machine learning technology to detect and distinguish different types of waste. “We want to offer our customers the most advanced technologies and the Zen Robotics Recycler is the best available technology in its field,”  , Sun Earth CEO, after his company made a deal with Zen Robotics in August last year. Unboxing and disposing of piles of packaging material is deemed a necessary evil of online shopping. But not anymore. After paying a small upfront fee, customers can return the packing by post after their shopping has been delivered. After the returned packaging is received, the user is rewarded with a voucher (usually ten euros) to use at any web store using the Repack service. “We believe that as long as reuse is made easy, people prefer it to throwawayism,”  , co-founder of Repack,  . This smart waste management company uses sensors to collect and analyse data from waste containers across the world, creating efficiencies and providing valuable insights. “We are excited to be working alongside Enevo in supplying innovative products that enable our customers to contribute towards a cleaner and more sustainable environment,”    , national sales manager at Glasdon UK, after a recent deal between the two companies made headlines. No textile goes to waste with this company, rather it forms the source of this 100 per cent recycled clothing. In fact, Pure Waste claims to have saved 200 million litres of freshwater by making products out of recycled cotton. “Recycling is no longer about finding the cheapest possible way to come up with some kind of mess; instead, the focus is on achieving the best possible end result,” company founder  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vincit-bankruptcy-europes-best-workplace/,Vincit: From bankruptcy to Europe’s best workplace,"Finnish software company Vincit is not your typical IT specialist. Over the last nine years, it has risen from near bankruptcy to a stock-listed company and was recently chosen as the best workplace in Europe. How did the company engineer such a turnaround? The core philosophy of   is that everybody should be ready to work hard, but also love what they do and find their work meaningful. Behind this is a line  , founder of Vincit, wrote on a napkin in 2007 saying ‘going to work on Monday should not piss you off’. “And this is what I set out to do. To build a company where working is fun and I thought later what we will actually do,” Kuitunen recalls with a laugh. “Now our only goal is that our customers and employees are always more satisfied tomorrow than today. All actions that can lead to this are a priority for us.” This means Vincit and its over 300 employees are happy to tackle almost any software challenge. The company offers a complete digital production chain from idea and service design to infrastructure and maintenance for customers of all sizes, from startups to global giants like GE Healthcare. “The only things that limit us are that we want challenging projects, happy customers and to offer the best employment,” Kuitunen explains. “Besides that we do not care what the industry or the project is, whether it is a resource management system, a mobile app or software for hospital equipment.” “The goal of our organisation is to have more satisfied employees and customers tomorrow than today,” says Vincit’s founder Mikko Kuitunen. 2016 has been a big year for Vincit. The company has just closed a successful IPO and after three consecutive ‘Best Place to Work’ titles in Finland (chosen by the Great Place to Work institute), Vincit won the Europe-wide category in June. It is a huge change from eight years ago when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy after losing its biggest customer. But instead of panicking, Kuitunen explained the situation to his team and invited everyone to openly discuss potential solutions. The commitment of the whole team got the company back on its feet. “We operate using a model based on fair play, openness and a belief everybody can lead themselves. There is no micromanagement,” Kuitunen says. “This has allowed us to have very open discussions even in tough situations. It is everyone’s responsibility to think about what to do in those situations. He also strongly believes wellbeing at work and life cannot be separated. For example Vincit’s employees are offered mental health services and personal trainers when needed. Even a sleep coach has been hired to help employees with small babies sleep better. “And what underpins everything is that a person feels they can have an impact,” adds Kuitunen. “We make sure everyone will be heard and give them the opportunity to influence major decisions” An example of this people-oriented approach is Vincit’s recent decision to open an office in Silicon Valley, California in August. The idea stemmed from company employees who wanted to try out working abroad. “We started to map out what it would require and decided to start a small office, where employees can be stationed for a year or two and take their families with them,” Kuitunen explains. “This makes our employees happy and can bring more business to us. If it flies great, but there is no heavy pressure.” For now the office is occupied by six Finns with the potential to employ locally in future. The Silicon Valley office has already signed its first customers and, while the company is still trialling how much of the Nordic work culture it can apply in the US, Kuitunen does not see any reason the office should not succeed. “Finland is such a deeply rooted engineering country that if you can make it here as an engineer, you can be outstanding elsewhere,” Kuitunen concludes. Vincit opened its first foreign office in Silicon Valley, California, in August. In October, the company received a warm welcome in New York City’s Times Square."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-finnish-food-beverage/,Five for Friday: Finnish food and beverage,"Finnish cuisine has always been all about sourcing what’s on offer seasonally to produce fresh, simple flavours. Now, as the recent foodie trend settles in for the long haul, a creative approach is fast becoming the norm around the country.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/glowway-guiding-way-darkness/,Glowway: guiding your way through darkness,"The Finnish company creates trailblazing photoluminescent pathway markings and signs that combine functionality with high-quality design. It all started with a simple order in the early 2000s, when   was commissioned to create floor number signs for a hotel. Parkkari, who at the time worked as an artist, had the idea of making the signs photoluminescent, meaning that they glowed in the dark. These signs gave the impetus for further development in photoluminescence, and ultimately Parkkari came across an innovation that he patented in 2007. This invention was the foundation on which the company   was established, and in 2012 the company got its first major break when it was commissioned to provide several metro stations in Helsinki with photoluminescent accessibility products. Now, many metro stations in the capital are equipped with Glowway’s products, including all the stations of the upcoming west metro extension. Since then Glowway has grown year after year, with its turnover reaching over 500 000 euros last year. The company is quickly establishing itself as an innovator in its domain, creating high-grade, aesthetically pleasing photoluminescent tiles. The creative force of Glowway, Jorma Parkkari. Glowway’s glass products easily stand out from other photoluminescent solutions, which are typically tapes or stickers. “Such solutions are short-lived and have to be replaced frequently, so architects aren’t fond of them,” Parkkari says. Moreover, part of the company’s philosophy is to design elegant products that blend in with their surroundings. “Architects can already in the design phase specify where they should be used, so they become an integral part of the interior design.” In May, the company launched a new stair nosing product, developed in collaboration with the Finnish Federation of the Visually Impaired. Thanks to its glow effect, the stair nosing makes steps easily visible in the dark, in addition to having an anti-slip rubber element. It exemplifies Glowway’s approach to product development: when installed, it becomes a built-in part of the step. The stair nosing will also be a key product in Glowway’s efforts to expand its business abroad. The company has already had some projects outside Finland – for instance the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle has Glowway’s photoluminescent tiles that guide to emergency exits – but on its near-term agenda is to zero in on other opportunities abroad. “Ultimately Finland is quite a small market for a company like us, but abroad there are countless possibilities, such as various railway projects and other constructions,” Parkkari says. The company’s pursuit of international opportunities is about to get a significant boost: Glowway is currently in the middle of a funding round with a major Finnish company planning to buy a part of the company. “This will give us broader shoulders, so to speak. This company will mostly take charge of the domestic market, so it will free more resources to pursue new markets,” Parkkari says. Running a rising company must keep one busy – does Parkkari still have time for art? “I used to until very recently. Some larger art works can take months to finish, and I just don’t have that kind of time anymore.” “Besides, I’m in charge of product development at Glowway, and I’m constantly facing interesting problems that require creative solutions, so there’s no real need to turn to art for inspiration anymore.”"

Latvala and his co-founders,   and  , started the company after working together at Finnish telecom giant Nokia and realising they had the knowledge to help businesses advance by making new technology accessible to them in practical ways. And this approach seems to be working. In just four years Intopalo has grown into an industrial software specialist with over 40 employees. It provides tailored software, security, artificial intelligence [AI] and augmented reality solutions for various industries and counts some of Finland’s biggest companies among its customers. These include sports watch manufacturer  , industrial machinery giant   and automation specialist  . Furthermore over a third of Intopalo’s turnover today comes from abroad, including France, Germany, Austria, the UK and US. Intopalo’s mantra is that it can translate practically any new technology into business benefit for its customers. A recent example includes using virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive, realistic training experience that allows companies to teach new skills without risking costly mistakes or delays in production. CEO Juha Latvala In practice this meant filming every step of a customer’s production process and transforming it into a virtual training platform where employees can safely practice new skills using VR equipment. It is projects like this that Intopalo says go a long way to proving the benefit of digital technologies to companies. “It is great that Finnish industry has shown hunger and intelligence in adopting for example artificial intelligence and VR,” Latvala says. “This is exactly how added value is produced today in Finland. It does not come from aiming to increase the tonnage of steel and machinery exports.” Latvala believes part of this open-mindedness comes from Finland’s strong engineering history and expertise in mobile and telecommunications technology. This has also been a driver behind Intopalo’s growth. “If you look at the areas where we are the most competitive at the moment, they are VR, AI and secure connectivity solutions and all of these have roots in the gaming industry, mobile technologies and great software expertise in Finland,” Latvala notes. “We Finns are often too modest here about [our skills].” Intopalo has been internationally oriented from the start and even has English as its working language. Still the company does not believe in specific internationalisation strategies, but instead going where demand arises and most of Intopalo’s foreign customers have found the company through word-of-mouth. “We never made a decision to go abroad, but started on day one with the assumption that there is need for our expertise outside Finland,” Latvala says. “We want to be where there the need is, whether that is Finland or abroad.” And there is no sight of demand slowing down as Intopalo believes digitalisation is only taking its first steps. “It is the latter phases that are the interesting ones,” Latvala concludes. “That is where we start to get systems that automatically, based on data, adjust how machines work or offer completely new services. That is where we really can start to talk about the digitalisation of everyday life… and that is why we are only getting started.” Intopalo’s virtual reality training service allows employees to practice new skills without the risk of costly mistakes or delays to production."

The frantic caller has gashed his leg with an axe. You are afraid he could die so tell him how to use his shirt as a tourniquet. Meanwhile, you send an ambulance to him as fast as you can. It is an intense experience, but don’t worry: this is only a game nominated for the   (GDWC). Independent games are hot. They can be innovative, entertaining, educational and make commentaries on important social issues. Because of their importance they have their own event: the GDWC. The purpose of the GDWC is to encourage new game developers and give them an opportunity to show their games before a large audience. Six finalists will visit Nordic gaming companies, as well as come to Slush Helsinki to wow several thousand people and the world media before the winners are announced. “This is a great chance to show that the games industry in Finland is more than just   and  ,” says event producer  . “We have a really great community of game developers here and want to show the rest of the world how we do things in Finland.” Almost 800 games were nominated for the 2016 event. Judges were from the Finnish gaming community and included gaming experts from private companies, universities and publications. GDWC has two main categories: serious and entertainment. 911 Operator is one of three games competing in the serious category. “We wanted to have a serious category to show the world that there are games that can teach, inform or otherwise help players while still being entertaining,” Rasila explains. “Games can be a very good method of teaching.” The three finalists for the serious category are teams from Palestine, Germany and Poland. The Polish team from Jutsu Games came up with  , where you act as an emergency services dispatcher and learn the basics of logistics and first aid. “Personally, I enjoyed seeing a few games that were meant to teach programming to children in an interesting manner,” Rasila continues. “I also greatly enjoyed  , which takes place during the Iranian revolution. For an indie game it had great quality and awesome production values.” In the entertainment category two teams from America and a team from Russia made the finals. These were diverse as well, ranging from 3D platform games to an adventure where the goal is to survive a dystopian autocratic future. “I think what struck out the most for me was just how many awesome games there were,” says Rasila. “It was a hard process to try and eliminate some of the games from the competition, and I honestly wish we could give out prizes and attention to more games.” Rasila is excited about new innovations in virtual reality gaming he has seen, but he also has a soft spot for nostalgic pixel art and unique visual styles. He is already thinking about what he will see next year. “I’m really looking forward to see how large we can make GDWC 2017!” he says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slush-movement-spreads-around-world/,The Slush movement spreads around the world,"With one day to go, did you know that Slush is not just an annual startup event in Helsinki? It has become a rapidly spreading global movement.  has been the CEO of   for only a couple of months, although she has been involved in the event in various positions for years. Her time with Slush leaves her with a definite idea of what she is a part of. “Slush is not an organisation or event. It is a movement,” Vikkula declares. “It is a non-profit community of young people who want to help others in entrepreneurship.” Slush started as simply an event in 2008, when 300 people gathered in Helsinki to discuss entrepreneurship and technology. Since then the Helsinki event has grown to over 15 000 participants and gained the attention of people all over the world. These people wondered: if the Finns can do that, why can’t we? CEO Marianne Vikkula has been involved in the event for years. “We haven’t specifically set out to expand internationally,” Vikkula continues. “This is a grass-roots movement. For instance, young entrepreneurs in Tokyo contacted us and said: ‘It sucks to be an entrepreneur here. Everyone expects us to get a job with some big corporation. What can we do to change the culture?’” The entrepreneur community in Tokyo was rather small and focused almost exclusively on Japan. Slush helped by stressing a global outlook just like they had done in Helsinki. This included using the English language and getting international involvement from speakers, investors and companies. “The first Slush Tokyo was in April 2015 and it was immediately the biggest international startup event in Japan,” says Vikkula. “Now more events are popping up in Japan which use English and are internationally focused. This is great, but it is a long process. It takes years.” Asia seems particularly excited about the Slush way of entrepreneurship. Events have been held in China, Singapore and Japan. They follow the successful Slush blueprint of encouraging networking, exchanging ideas, accessing capital and partners, as well as the famous pitching competitions. The events are part conference and part festival (the Slush parties are legendary and are a great place for informal networking). Over 2 000 attendees were at  , while about twice as many went to  . In 2015 the Chinese event was held in Beijing, but for 2016 it moved to Shanghai.   opened with 5 000 attendees, including 270 startups, 360 investors, 120 journalists and 500 volunteers from 48 countries. The main organiser,  , explained that the entire purpose was to “build bridges between China and the rest of the world.” The Slush formula has worked very well in Finland, and the organisers are delighted that people throughout the world are making it work for them, too. “I have no time to rest,” laughs Vikkula. “After the Helsinki event we have Slush Tokyo coming up in March. We had about 40 events in 2016 and there will be more in 2017. Now we want to really focus on our four key communities of Helsinki, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. We want to help them to become bigger and better.” This year, Slush Shanghai attracted 5 000 attendees, including 270 startups, 360 investors, 120 journalists and 500 volunteers from 48 countries."

Through the project refugees have started their own businesses such as phone repair shops, traditional handicrafts and barbers who use Middle Eastern beard grooming techniques on big-bearded modern hipsters. Giants like   and   have conquered the mobile gaming industry, and Slush is still the place to go to find the coolest games. An interesting twist is how gaming is evolving: it is not just what to play, but how to play. A great example is Rovio spin-off  , which allows the streaming of games just like how we can stream music or movies today. Additionally, Hatch has added many more social features to make playing games more communal. , the co-founder of Flickr, said at Slush: “Technology is a great slave but a terrible master.” In the not-too-distant past a lot of technology was developed simply to see if it was possible. Now the tide is shifting: companies look at human problems first and only then see how technology can provide a solution. For instance, what if you want to insure something unusual which isn’t covered by traditional insurance companies? Simple. Now you can use crowdfunding insurance through the new company  . It is a new way to spread risk. One of the big trends at Slush this year was data protection and privacy.   is working on local networks that use AI to defend, organise and repair themselves. The EU passed the new General Data Protection Regulation and many startups are dedicated to helping firms get compliant. The winner of the legendary Slush pitching competition this year was CybelAngel, who detect data leakages and monitor the Dark Web and IoT for threats. Slush has gained a global reputation and huge multinationals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung have a presence there. But the main stars of the show remain the ambitious entrepreneurs and the small companies they create. Slush has helped develop a new culture of innovation and entrepreneurship that is working year-round, not just every dark and dreary November."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/spot-shop-takes-sweat-sales-shopping/,SPOT-A-SHOP takes the sweat out of sales shopping,"Even online, sales shopping can be a chore, as you never know which site has reduced the price of your desired coat the most. Finnish SPOT-A-SHOP has solved the problem by doing exactly what is says on the tin: spotting the shop on behalf of the shopper. The SPOT-A-SHOP office in central Helsinki resembles most startup spaces: spacious and trendy, with smart casual dressed young employees chatting in English in front of their laptops, all clustered around a communal table. Apart from the coders. They’re sat in a separate, quiet room – with the door firmly closed. “We’d disturb them far too much if they had to share the room with us,” company co-founder   says laughingly. In the early days of the fashion sales site, Hilario and co-founder number two   worked in Jyläs’ flat. In just under two years, the company has moved house, and its team has expanded and grown more international. Since its first site was launched in July 2015, SPOT-A-SHOP has served approximately 1.5 million consumers. The idea is as simple: to gather all fashion sales products onto the one site. An online shopper doesn’t need to glance through dozens of tabs to find out which retailer sells a winter jacket the cheapest, when the site shows them all at one go. Nothing normal priced, all on sale. SPOT-A-SHOP currently serves shopaholics in  ,   and  . Jyläs and Hilario wanted to hire native speakers to make sure all nuances are taken into account. Entering new language areas will always mean new recruits. Spot-a-Shop team as a whole. Jesse Jyläs is the third from the left in the back, Matias Hilario just in front of him. The list of available stores is impressive, including online retail giants such as Zalando, Boozt and Ellos. The company generates its revenue through the traffic it diverts to the sites of its customers. The shoppers themselves can compare all available shops and do refined searches amongst brands, shoe sizes, colours and the like. Those seriously hunting for proper discounts can set sales alerts for such things as certain brands or product types. The logic is similar to flight or travel search engines. “We often refer to SPOT-A-SHOP as the ‘Momondo of fashion’,” Hilario explains. “If someone is looking for a parka but doesn’t know where to look, our service will always find the most affordable option.” Jyläs points out that SPOT-A-SHOP is a win-win for both shoppers and shops. The customers are already at the end of the purchase funnel when they get directed to the retailer’s site from SPOT-A-SHOP. “The fashion cycle is so rapid; many online stores have half of their stock on sale at all times,” he says. “Sale items are no longer last season, but stores need to get them sold to make room for upcoming collections. Our site works as an additional marketing channel for what’s already on sale, and there is less need for further price reductions.” Currently the company collaborates with over 150 retailers. In the three markets put together, the shopper has access to hundreds of thousands of fashion items. There are constant negotiations with more and more online stores to be included. The nine-person team can handle a lot of traffic, because the actual purchases are made through, and customer service is provided by, the online stores themselves. “We don’t need stocks or distribution networks as essentially we serve as an additional marketing channel,” Jyläs says. “That’s why we’re cost-effective for not only shoppers but our customers, the stores, too.” The   has been closely involved in developing the concept, and the company also has received support from angel investors. Currently there is an ongoing funding round, which will dictate the coming steps. Germany and France are looking promising, and the duo has already eyed more international doors to knock on. “With the ongoing funding round, we’re looking for extra muscle for the new market entries,” Jyläs says. If all goes to plan, next year SPOT-A-SHOP will be present in several new areas – and there might be less elbow space to play with around the communal table, as new members join in the chatter. Looking for a new dress but thinking it might be cheaper next door? SPOT-A-SHOP is based on the idea of opening all the doors with one click."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wopi-knows-person-not-job/,"Wopi knows the person, not the job","Finnish company Competence Dimensions is using a unique process to help organisations hire and develop the right people. Ballet dancers and creative MBA students seem to be polar opposites, but they share some important traits like intuitive thinking. If jobs for creative MBAs faded away, students could look at reskilling themselves for the ballet. While a humorous example, this demonstrates how a Finnish company is revolutionising modern work life. “Jobs are changing, but competencies are not,” explains  , CEO of  . “Thanks to digitalisation jobs are being disrupted with increased speed. However, the basic human drivers leading to universal basic competencies have not changed since we were cavemen.” Competence Dimensions is a premier testing and assessment company for human resources. It was formed in 2002, mainly to help Nokia design a new motivation-based coaching program. The keystone of Niitamo’s decades of research is the Work Personality Inventory (WOPI), a questionnaire to measure the motives, thinking and attitude drivers of competence. With it, they are able to help reskill a workforce challenged by new competency requirements caused by digitalisation. “I am very excited about the coming year,” states CEO Petteri Niitamo. “We focus on the less-changing competencies driven by age-old psychological drivers,” Niitamo continues. “I could go back to the Stone Age, administer WOPI and find the same type of people we find today. There would be hunters driven by competition, leaders driven by leadership motives and shamans driven by intuitive thinking.” Even without the disruption of occupations, he says going back to basic competencies is important today. An example Niitamo gives is the engineer. Today an engineer has to know how to sell their technical solution, calling for completely opposite thinking from what they are used to. An age-old problem in human resources is recruiting and training staff. Traditionally they were handled as entirely different functions. A hiring process might look for one type of person, but a development program may be designed for a completely different type of person. “HR people have known this problem for decades, but they needed a conceptual solution for it,” Niitamo says. “By focusing on basic competencies the two functions can be integrated. At the hiring stage you should already have a plan to train the person’s competence and build your training on the pre-hire assessment.” Competence Dimensions is based in Helsinki and has operations in Stockholm and Zurich. Their clients tend to be HR consultancies, but after the publication of their integrated human resource development system their target has shifted to private and public organisations. They have worked with everyone from mid-sized Finnish companies to massive multinationals. “One interesting project concerns women as leaders in different parts of the world,” says Niitamo. “A peculiarity among Asian female leaders is their immense focus on quality and perfection, a distinguishing feature of ballet dancers as well. Is it a ‘woman thing’ or an ‘Asian thing’? We don’t yet know. “Following the InnoFinland 2010 Award we recently received a prestigious award from the International Test Commission for our work, even though we are small compared to many of the other international testing companies,” he concludes. “We also have some great projects coming up. I am very excited about the coming year.” On ya bike! The company is based in Helsinki and has operations in Stockholm and Zurich."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/global-market-warms-optiwatti/,Global market warms to OptiWatti,"Finnish company Opti Automation offers a welcome solution for the colder months of the year: significant energy savings via its innovative, automated approach.  What if you could, without compromising comfort, reduce your heating bill by 40 per cent? Given the grey, wintry landscape currently residing outdoors, this proposition is nothing less than compelling. Well, up-and-coming Finnish company Opti Automation can do just this, thanks to its home automation solution for houses with electric heating systems known as  . The secret is cutting out redundant heating: OptiWatti monitors room temperature constantly, adjusting it throughout the day based on the preferences defined by the user. These can be set not only for different times of the day, but also for each room individually. This makes saving electricity easy, as the room temperature can be set up, for example, to decrease by a couple of degrees in the daytime when the house is empty, or in the sitting room overnight when everyone is asleep. The system is also aware of electricity price fluctuations and can prioritise cheaper hours. Thanks to these features, OptiWati pays itself back in two to three years on average, according to CEO and co-founder  . “Typically our customers are astounded when they realise how much you can save.” Compared to automated systems, houses with manually adjustable heating tend to have less than optimal room temperatures, especially as it is easy to get used to the temperature being off by a couple of degrees. “Even a little extra warmth can have a big impact on your electricity bill,” Marjeta says. Preferences defined by the user can be set not only for different times of the day, but also for each room individually. “It’s much easier to have control when everything is centralised on one interface, and when all you need to do is set the temperatures and times, and the system takes care of the rest,” he continues. “Our principle is that automation should always make things easier, not more complicated.” Marjeta says that OptiWatti grew out of his own needs: “I got tired of adjusting thermostats manually in our home, and started looking for a centralised solution. I couldn’t find anything affordable, so together with a partner we ended up launching the firm and started to develop such a product.” The first OptiWatti products entered the market in 2015, and since then it has gained many additional functions, such as control of air source heat pumps and hot water heaters, and water leak monitors. OptiWatti can also manage car heating, taking into account weather forecast in calculating when to start the heating. By all accounts, the marketplace has welcomed OptiWatti enthusiastically: the company’s turnover is growing at a rate of 400 per cent annually, while its number of staff has grown from the original two to 11. Moreover, Opti Automation plans to hire 13 more people this year. Such growth is being recognised: at last year’s  , a business growth competition, Opti Automation took home the Energy Sector Business Growth Prize and the Gaselli award for the fastest growth, in addition to winning the general Start-Up category. In the short term, the company has set its eyes on the Swedish market, while an expansion in Northern Europe is further on the horizon. For the ambitious company, the growing home automation trend offers opportunities far beyond heating. “One future trend is electric car charging, so that the car is charged when electricity is cheap,” Marjeta says, adding that the firm has also other developments in the pipeline. “With OptiWatti, we have a solid primary product, and we can develop many interesting things on it.” Right now, the biggest challenge for OptiWatti is publicity. “Most people don’t know that heating can be automated like this, and often the first reaction when people hear about us is that it can’t be possible,” Marjeta says. “This is typically followed by: How come no one has come up with the idea before!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/started-second-hand-first-choice/,"We Started This: Second-hand, first choice","Not everyone believed in Sara Nyyssölä’s business pitch when she announced her idea of buying and selling pre-worn clothes. Now, she and her team have proven the doubters wrong. The   (WST) store is eye-catchingly classy. The space looks huge, and although the selection is abundant, there’s plenty of room to roam around between the racks. The backroom is another story; there are bags and boxes everywhere. The business is busy, which is a slap in the face for those who thought selling second-hand clothes wouldn’t arouse customers’ excitement. WST has grown from a website run from Sara and  ’s childhood home basement in 2013, to a massive shop near central Helsinki and an online store that ships high-end fashion to different corners of the world. WST receives the items from people who either pop into the shop or ship them over, decides which ones suit their standard and then puts on the price tag. When the piece has found a new home, the initial owner pockets half of the money. The concept proves that people really are willing to rethink their choices when it comes to fashion. “I figured people would buy more second-hand if the process was easy and stylish – similar to buying new,” Sara Nyyssölä recalls. “Turns out, they really do.” Sara and Laura have grown up wandering around Finnish fleamarkets. As a teen, Sara noticed her friends weren’t as keen on the hobby that felt like treasure-hunting to her. During her studies, Sara spent six months working in Hong Kong, where she learned a lot about online sales. She started to develop an idea of offering a new platform for second-hand fashion. Some deemed it a dead end, but fortunately, Sara found believers: once she was back in Finland, Laura and another friend, now-CEO  , jumped onboard. After two startup programmes, plenty of hours spent hosting popup shops and a lot of fleamarket-meandering, there’s no doubt WST has found its place. Second-hand fashion is finding new fans, and WST has sent packages not only all over Finland, but all over the globe. We Started This and Marimekko collaborate to get second hand Marimekko items back in business. “People still want to update their wardrobes, but they’re looking for ways to do it more sustainably,” Sara explains. “We provide them not only with “new” clothes, but also a place where to recycle the ones they no longer use.” Fashion brands are recognising the trend too: for example, there is a second-hand store for the Swedish fashion brand Filippa K in Stockholm. WST is keen to collaborate directly with brands, and a year ago, the world-renowned Finnish design brand   started to organise its second-hand sales through WST. The company sets up a popup collection desk in a Marimekko shop, customers bring their pre-owned clothes, and then WST sells them forward. The concept has been very well received by global fashion fans. In addition to the Nyyssölä sisters and Jaakkola, WST has a fourth owner. So far, the company has been able to bootstrap its own growth, and there’s been no need to seek investors. The workload is proving quite heavy for the small team. At some point, there’ll be a need for spare pairs of hands, especially when marketing efforts will be focused further away from the homeland. Many European countries, such as Sweden and Germany, are well acquainted with second-hand shopping. Sara Nyyssölä is aware of the challenges WST might face further away. “In Finland, we’re used to recycling and siblings wearing hand-me-down items of clothing when they reach a certain age, but this is not the case everywhere,” she notes. “When I lived in Hong Kong, there seemed to be no market for pre-owned fashion.” WST’s advantage in comparison to many online fleamarkets is that every piece of clothing is curated by the company. The sisters take pride in being picky about what makes it to their site and shelves. No fast-fashion brands pass through the filter. As second-hand shopping has grown trendier in the past few years, many other sites have popped up to tap the market. That doesn’t worry the Nyyssöläs in the slightest. “We’re all in the same boat, helping ethical consumption and normalising second-hand buying,” they say. “Whoever manages to support that mission, we’re only happy to see it happen!” WST wants second-hand clothing to be a genuine alternative to buying new."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/combinostics-uses-ai-to-improve-early-diagnosis/,Combinostics uses AI to improve early diagnosis,"New Finnish technology is tapping into machine learning and artificial intelligence to support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis of neurological disorders.  When a person is suspected of having a memory disorder, they undergo extensive tests ranging from brain scans to neurological examinations. It is then up to their physician to analyse the results. However, even an experienced doctor may struggle to arrive at an accurate diagnosis during the early stages of a disease. Finnish healthtech company   has a solution for this in mind: its cloud-based tools for the comprehensive analysis of patient data. “Today in healthcare, physicians are being overwhelmed with more and more data,” says  , CEO of Combinostics. “Imaging data gets larger and larger in volume and there is new information all the time. We help to turn this data into insights.” “Our system visualises all the data in a compact way so the physician can understand why the patient’s data is pointing to a certain diagnosis,” explains Lennart Thurfjell. The company’s approach is divided into two parts. First, its brain image assessment tool automatically extracts various biomarkers (such as changes in brain atrophy) from brain scans. Then this information is combined with all other available clinical data to create a data profile of the patient, which is compared to a database of previously diagnosed patients. The result? A detailed analysis ascertaining which disease is most likely and how far it has progressed. Thurfjell emphasises that Combinostics is not trying to replace doctors, but rather offer them intelligent tools to support accurate early diagnosis. All the patient data is available in a visual and compact way for healthcare professionals to examine. “If a physician suspects the patient has a certain disease and then sees the relevant data points in this direction, they will feel more confident to do the diagnosis at an early stage,” he explains. Combinostics’ technology is built on years of research at the   studying AI and machine learning for diagnostics. The company spun off from VTT in 2014 and its first product was launched commercially in December two years later. Combinostics’ brain image assessment tool is currently used by a handful of university hospitals and radiology service providers in Finland and Sweden, and it will be soon complemented with a clinical decision support tool to provide full patient data analysis. This is where the technology really stands out from the competition. “The clinical decision support part is a very hot topic,” Thurfjell says. “A lot of people are talking about it, but there are no data-driven clinical decision support tools in neurology out on the market yet. We will launch our clinical decision support product in Europe in the next two months [to be the first].” While Combinostics is currently focused on diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, expansion to other neurological areas could be on the cards in 2018. The Tampere-based company is already laying the groundwork for this in an EU-wide research project studying the prediction of neurodegenerative diseases. But first Combinostics is looking to expand beyond Finland, Sweden and the UK, where it already has contracts. The company plans to launch in the US during the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval. Thurfjell is also eyeing Asian markets, but is waiting for the right local partner. The healthcare market is moving fast and Combinostics plans to maintain its head start. “Data-driven diagnostics, big data, machine learning. Everyone realises these technologies have huge potential in healthcare” Thurfjell says. “A lot will happen within the next few years.” Combinostics’ image analysis tool ensures even the subtlest of changes in the brain will be detected."

Finnish Netflea gets unused items off shelves and storage rooms back into business.  rolled his eyes. He’d just found out his wife had bought a second-hand dress for their daughter for three euros – and paid almost five euros for shipping. “It just went against my logic,” he says. “How was it possible that the postage more than doubled the cost?” Ever since their daughter was born, it seemed to Salo that his wife popped to the post office pretty much every day. This time, he grabbed the wrapping and saw that the sender had paid the exact amount, just under five euros, for the delivery costs. His wife pointed out that eight euros wasn’t much for the dress. “I agreed, but I still didn’t see how it made sense,” he explains. “The seller had gone through the effort of taking a photo, posting an advert, dealing with a mountain of responses, buying packaging materials and going to the post office to mail it. That’s a lot of work for three euros, and those three euros include the price of the product.” Salo didn’t understand why his wife wouldn’t buy more cheap stuff from the same seller to reduce the shipping cost per item. She said that particular person didn’t have anything else that tickled her fancy. Salo, being a logistics professional, couldn’t let go of the thought. Fleamarket groups on Facebook were hugely popular and ever growing. Doesn’t anyone coordinate this sort of thing, so that it would be possible to order second-hand products from different people at one go? All it would take is careful thinking and effective processing, Salo figured. Turned out no one did. Not until now. After convincing an investor and the Finnish Funding for Innovation  , Salo and his old friend   launched their first online fleamarket website in Finland in 2014. At the time, circular economy wasn’t as much of a buzzword as it is now. Ossi Salo In order to attract visitors, the site needed something to offer. Salo and Manninen jumped in the car and drove around all fleamarkets in northern Finland to stock up on things they thought would be most likely to sell, such as clothes for women and children and sports equipment. The idea caught on: now, an average customer purchases seven or eight products for a fixed shipping fee. Both ends of the process are considered. A seller takes a photo of the product, sets a price and ships the thing to  ’s storage in Oulu. Once it’s received, Netflea puts it online, with one euro added to the price, and finds its slot in the storage – all of this taking about half a minute. When the product is sold, the seller is paid the original price and Netflea keeps the added euro. “This way, the service feels free to the seller, similarly to platforms like Facebook,” Salo says. The product is on the site for 12 weeks. Every three weeks the price goes down 20 per cent. If, after the 12-week period, the product hasn’t found a new home, the original owner can either have it shipped back or donate it through Netflea. However, according to Salo, every four in five items are sold. When it comes to the buyer, they have access to numerous cheap second-hand items at one glance, with extensive search options – and with only one stamp to pay for and consumer rights guaranteed. “Our goal was, and still is, to make Netflea the best place to both buy and sell online,” he says. In February, the service was launched in 12 other European countries, with marketing efforts focusing on Germany, Poland and the Netherlands. The site uses Google’s translation tools, so that a pair of jeans put on sale in Lapland is equally available to people abroad not knowing a word of Finnish. This multiplies the number of both potential buyers and sellers. Salo points out that not all markets are alike. A combination of countries works in everyone’s favour. “In Italy, there’s virtually no market for second-hand fashion, but people are keen on selling,” Salo says. “In the Nordic countries, second-hand is trendy, and a lot of people would be willing to see what Italians have in their wardrobes.” The stock is currently stored in Oulu. Once Netflea has established its international presence, the company will consider other location options based on convenience and cost-effectiveness. Netflea employs about a dozen people directly, and indirectly it provides work to subcontractors in fields like software development and marketing. The company’s internationalisation efforts have been boosted by Finpro’s   programme. Without it, Salo doesn’t think Netflea would’ve stepped across Finnish borders. The market is wide and open, though. Salo says that whilst a lot of second-hand enterprises focus on high-profit but non-mainstream items, such as luxury fashion, Netflea’s strength – and profitability – lies in volumes. “Others are trying to reach the top of the iceberg.

True fandom won’t stick to just the films – here are five ways in which you can decorate your life with the art by Tom of Finland, formally known as Touko Laaksonen. Safety first, but it doesn’t mean style doesn’t count! Finnish Jalo Helsinki sells fire blankets that portray Tom of Finland artwork. When   spoke to the company’s CCO    , he said the reason Tom of Finland designs were chosen was that the art was so well-known. With the film coming out and spreading across the globe, there’s no doubt the fire of its fame will be fueled even more. , San Diego-based clothes designer Rufskin launched a 15-piece collection featuring artwork by Tom of Finland. Even if you don’t have the top-notch trained body of the men in the drawings, fear not: sports clothing tends to stretch. If you like your coffee hot, consider filling your coffee maker with Robert Paulig’s Tom of Finland.  , the coffee’s dark roast flavour is representative of the allure of Tom’s Men; “unapologetic, self-aware and boastfully proud”. “Tom of Finland is truly an art and pop culture icon,” noted  , president of Robert Paulig Roastery, when the product was announced. “His masculine characters are a celebration of tolerance and joie de vivre, capturing the hearts of everyone at Robert Paulig Roastery.” Getting into bed with Tom of Finland has never been this easy: all you need to do is slip your duvet and pillow into the bed linen from Finlayson’s Tom of Finland collection. If bedtime business isn’t enough for you, the range reaches all the way to the kitchen, too, with items like kitchen towels and oven mittens. Finnish Finlayson was established exactly 100 years before Touko Laaksonen’s birth. Finnish Posti released its Tom of Finland stamps in 2014. They received a lot of international attention, with preorders from Posti’s online shop from 178 different countries.  , the Tom of Finland stamp is “generally considered the most talked-about stamp publication of all time, world-wide”."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/in4mo-stakes-its-claim-with-software-solution/,in4mo stakes its claim with software solution,"This Finnish company’s innovation speeds up the building insurance claim handling process and helps coordinate related activities quickly and efficiently.  may have immortalised the idea of  , however, the presence of dampness indoors is nothing to rejoice about for a policy-holding property owner and their insurer. Regrettably, it is estimated that some 60 000 incidences of water damage occur annually in Finland. Of these, insurance companies pay total or partial compensation in about 38 000 cases. Other countries surely are no strangers to the same. Imagine how laborious it is to get all the parties – the right renovator, the insurer and the policyholder – to solve the reported damage at the right time. Enter the solution of  : a software system that transforms a complex and also highly emotional situation into a set of perfectly coordinated activities. “Before our system, when property owners had a case of water/moisture damage in their home or other premises they called the insurance company, starting a long and complex resolution process,” says  , marketing and strategic planning director of in4mo. “This work was highly manual and laborious.” With this gap in the market waiting to be filled, this Espoo-based company in business since 2007 took it upon itself to come up with a solution that relies on the latest mobile and Internet technologies. “We set out to create a strong ecosystem of partners around the insurance company to enable them to face any eventuality encountered by always finding the best partners,” Andre says. With in4mo’s building claim software solution, insurance companies can process related claims a lot faster and smoother. “The idea is to standardise the repair reporting and handling process for inspectors and builders working in the field and claims handlers at insurers’ offices,” he explains. We believe that our solutions and experience help insurers in any markets to better control their building claims. So, how does the system work in practice? Everything starts when the policy holder calls the insurance company about property damage. At this instant, a case is created in the in4mo system and followed through until resolution. The inspector examining the circumstances reports observations with the mobile app that is also used by the building contractors performing the repair work. Meanwhile, the insurance company relies on the browser-based interface and the policyholder can follow case progress on his browser. “The whole system is better organised for all parties, including faster reciprocal information provision and thereby overall handling of the claim, resulting in smiling faces across the board,” Andre lists. In addition to its native haunts, in4mo currently operates also in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. In 2016 alone they reported plenty of new partnerships across the Nordics. “Insurance and building requirements differ from country to country, requiring local adaptation of the company’s system, including localised language versions,” Andre continues. “Additionally, as more people get familiar with smartphones and tablets, our systems become easier to implement.” Advancements in phone technology play a big part, as exemplified by the development of smartphone cameras used for reporting building damage and negating the need for conventional cameras. Not least owing to the company’s international staff representing 15 different nationalities, in4mo is, however, in position to seek global growth. “We are actively looking for opportunities to enter new markets,” Andre says. “We believe that our solutions and experience help insurers in any markets to better control their building claims.” In a world where mobile technologies gain more and more ground – and roofs continue to leak – rest assured: we will be hearing about in4mo for some time yet. With in4mo’s building claim software solution, insurance companies can process related claims a lot faster and smoother."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/silence-is-quieton/,Silence is QuietOn,"Finnish company QuietOn has created a genuine innovation that revolutionises the meaning of deafening silence with active noise cancellation and acoustic noise attenuation. Dentists like them. Their customers love them. Couples benefit from them. Business travellers promote them. Why are   earplugs so captivating? Simply because the much valued Finnish silence is now on everyone’s lips. QuietOn earplugs boost one’s wellbeing by reducing stress brought upon by continuous background noise. They help users to improve performances by avoiding distractions so that the focus is on the task at hand. Furthermore, they can convert an exhausting flight into a relaxing journey. These noise cancellation earplugs are one-of-a-kind in the world, whose form factory makes it possible to comfortably rest a head on a pillow or work anywhere without the need of the noise cancellation headphones. “Our feedback has been magical,” rejoices  , COB and founder of QuietOn. “The product has the potential to change people’s lives. Its ability to minimise the irritation caused by snoring has already saved some marriages.” The noise cancellation is ideal to lessen sleep-disturbing noises, such as snoring and noises coming through walls. Thorough research and modelling have paid dividends, and an ideal design to fit the earplugs perfectly in the user’s ear began to see daylight in early 2015. “I used to travel a lot and was constantly stressed in noisy airplanes, airports and hotels,” Kyllönen recalls. “I once tried these noise cancellation headphones at an airport. Those provided me a good, relaxed feeling, but they were too expensive and clumsy to use and carry. After a while that good feeling they produced evolved into an idea of silence and what its value is.” Kyllönen began to wonder why the noise cancellation technology has not been widespread. “I figured out that I need to build a wireless device so small that it could fit in the ear, thus enabling sleeping,” he explains. Soon after, Kyllönen joined forces with sound engineers and founded the company QuietOn together with one of them,  . Utilising facilities provided by Yritystakomo Oulu, the engineers managed to produce functional prototypes, where earplugs combine active noise cancelling technology and passive attenuation in small size. “When flying, everyone can observe that ordinary soft earplugs are pretty useless,” Kyllönen points out. “Those decrease the low frequency noise by a maximum of five decibels, while our noise cancellation can make reductions of up to 40 decibels.” The innovation hit the home run at the beginning of 2016. When the product was about to set forth, 9 000 pairs were pre-ordered via   straight away worth over 1.3 million US dollars. “Those pre-orders are now delivered – distributed to over 100 countries,” says Kyllönen. “Today, we can manufacture 2 000 pairs a week. Demand is so high that we have some challenges to deliver everything. We are striving to increase production capacity even more.” The production unit is currently in Tallinn, Estonia, where a former Nokia production line has been reutilised. Research & development as well as the company headquarters are located in Oulu, Finland. The long lasting product is equipped with a lithium battery, which handles a couple of thousand charges without significantly losing its power or duration. One charge lasts one week’s worth of good night’s sleeps, or 50 hours at time. Although the marketing budget has been next to nothing, the high quality of the product has been speaking in volumes. “For example, in Japan, after one large magazine wrote about us, we sold 20 000 US dollars worth of products in just one day,” Kyllönen tells. “Australia suddenly become our third-most important market, after a story about us was published in Virgin Australia’s in-flight magazine.” Roughly one-third of the company’s profit comes from US, and any day now, QuietOn products will be available in US, Canada and Mexico via Amazon. Europe will soon follow. There are also deals with airline companies to sell products in-flight. According to Kyllönen, there are still new surprising segments coming into sight daily that find QuietOn useful. “One very interesting clientele are dentists who have had a long career and are suffering from impaired hearing,” says Kyllönen. “Furthermore, their customers with dental anxiety like our product a lot. QuietOn eases the distress by limiting  machinery noise, and in a sense, takes one out of the situation. As being the only wireless and pocket size noise cancellation device in the world, QuietOn has a golden opportunity to take great advantage of the empty, yet significant and global market of silence."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-winter-sport-technologies/,Five for Friday: Winter sports technologies,"Most people in the Nordics have had their eyes glued to the goings on at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in the city of Lahti, held from 22 February to 5 March. This has been a perfect time to show the world what Finland is made of. Thus, this past week   led a delegation of Chinese journalists and investors that were keen to discover what’s happening in the field of Finnish winter sport snowhow. Here are some of the highlights of their visit. A key member of the Finnish consortium of arena and ice hockey rink design, manufacturing and construction professionals known as the Winter Sports Arena Experts Group, this company is aiming high in the flourishing Chinese winter sports technology market. “We have already produced nearly 2 000 ice hockey rinks in 25 countries in Europe, Russia and Asia,” says    , export manager. “There have been major investments to develop and produce safer ice hockey rinks from recreational ice hockey to professional leagues, from training halls to championship arenas.” A real game-changer for sports-related professionals, this company provides a global service that promotes equality and transparency in sports and helps the registered users to succeed in finding jobs and creating new contacts. “One of our main goals is to bring different sports together into one forum and get all pros networking,” explains CEO  . This concept promotes the healthy and fun outdoor lifestyle and is a prime example why Finns succeed so well in snow-related sports. Developed by the Finnish Ski Area Association, Werneri Ski School is a nationwide physical education and playing program for five-to-15-year-old children. According to the company’s webpage, “the idea of Werneri Ski School is to teach children downhill skiing and snowboarding on their own terms. The method is supportive and action-packed. Children get more excited when they can learn with other kids. Physical training skills develop by themselves while playing.” Blood, sweat and tears are the palpable results of what this comprehensive Sport Institute of Finland can provide. Athletes and coaches from a great variety of sports participate year-round in different tailored programmes in this leading sports training centre in the country. “We have the best knowledge of ice hockey in a world,” says  , head of the sports training centre. “This is the reason why Chinese ice hockey league KHL team Red Star Kunlun wanted us to host their very first pre-season training camp.” This future trendsetter has already captured the Nordic sports market and has distribution in a further 29 countries worldwide, while achieving recognition in the market with top tier products and firmly expanding portfolio. “ONE WAY wants to lift the brand to be number one choice for consumers when dealing with high-quality cycling, running and Nordic sports gear,” the company tells on its website. “We aim to strengthen the authentic Nordic sports image which in turn will boost our brand.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rivender-brings-shop-shopless/,Rivender brings the shop to the shopless,"An unmanned grocery store consisting of modules used to sound like science fiction. Now, Finnish Rivender wants to make it the standard of staffless shopkeeping. Imagine you’re baking biscuits. What do you do when you notice there’s no butter in the fridge or sugar on the shelf? Do you knock on your neighbour’s door or pop downstairs to a cornershop? In sparsely populated countries like Finland, nipping to the local is not an option for everyone. Those living remotely, be it in a village in the mountains of Spain or far north in Lapland, might have to hop in the car and drive dozens of kilometres to reach the nearest grocery store. “In Finland, small cornershops are disappearing, and the trend is continuing,” Rivender CEO   says. “It’s by no means only a Finnish phenomenon, but visible in Europe in general. Supermarkets are getting bigger in size and smaller in number.” Sometimes, having a small shop with few potential customers might simply not make financial sense, particularly in places where employment costs are high. In some villages, the problem might be finding someone to continue shopkeeping, should the previous owners wish to retire. CEO Juha Pennanen This is where Finnish   wants to step in. It has created Modulshop, a machine and solution that consists of product modules and doesn’t require constant staff presence. Any everyday items, including those needing refrigeration, can be sold in the patented module units. Rivender was founded in 2013, but its story goes back to 2009, when the current chairman of the board and Rivender co-founder   piloted an unmanned grocery shop near his hometown in western Finland. Taking on board the lessons learned from the pilot, he started to develop the concept further. Pennanen jumped onboard after a business plan had been created. There were plenty of pieces in the puzzle that needed putting together. Rivender had to find partners to take care of engineering, design, software development and payment transactions. The end result, Modulshop, was born out of the collaboration of over a dozen companies. The first version was put to test in the break room of one of the cooperating companies. This led to improvements in the technology, and now, the first ever Modulshop “supermarket” serves customers outside of a hypermarket in the Finnish town of Forssa. “This is a testing phase, so we can see what works, and then build on that,” Pennanen notes. The CEO believes that the best way to run a Modulshop is a hybrid approach: a member of staff selling meat, fish, lottery tickets and coffee for parts of the day, and the rest of the time the shop looks after itself. Rivender isn’t the only player in the field of unmanned shops. Among others, the retail giant Amazon has developed a concept known as Amazon Go, a supermarket packed with computer vision and sensors that detect and keep track of the customer’s purchases. However, this solution’s target markets are different to those of Rivender’s Modulshop. Rivender doesn’t aim to stay in the manufacturing business. The final goal is to be awarding licenses to other companies, whilst retaining control of the product and its development. “We’re planning to open the software interface to other European vending machine manufacturers,” Pennanen explains. “Not to make them improve the product on our behalf; rather, to improve so that they can sell it and we just offer them the license to do so.” Rivender’s solution has gathered attention in Norway and Spain, and it’s looking to find partners elsewhere in Western Europe, too. Pennanen points out that in countries where labour is cheap, there’s no room for Rivender, but where labour costs are high, a store equipped with Modulshop poses a viable alternative – especially to those lengthy drives to the nearest hypermarket, when all you need is a pinch of sugar or knob of butter for your biscuits. Any everyday items, including those needing refrigeration, can be sold in the patented module units."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/friends-brgrs-top-food-chain/,Friends & Brgrs at the top of the food chain,"This growing family of Finnish burger restaurants is taking its fresh approach to fast casual dining to the global market. It’s 3 pm on a Friday afternoon. The dining area is packed with the bubbling chatter of teenagers and twentysomethings. A young woman takes orders from behind a small counter against one wall, dispensing small talk to customers along with their receipts. To her right, a glass-fronted kitchen houses a team of youngsters preparing burgers and fries in full view of those eager to feast on them. Clean, friendly, flavoursome and transparent – welcome to  . The Finnish culinary scene has enjoyed an unprecedented renaissance in recent years. Gone are the days of basic flavours and tired recipes. In their place resides a local restaurant scene infused with experiences more suited to global taste buds. Everything is made in-house at Friends & Brgrs. “We can really see a strong trend when it comes to preparing food, with transparency and quality,” observes  , co-founder and CFO of Friends & Brgrs. “People want to know what they eat, see it when it’s being prepared and that local ingredients are being used as much as possible.” Taking inspiration from similar establishments in the US, Friends & Brgrs is thus giving people what they want, by infusing fast food with fresh flavours. “We were the first company to bring ‘fast casual’ to Finland,” he clarifies. “Actually, we prefer to call ourselves ‘fresh casual’. We make everything in-house from fresh ingredients.” In addition to the grinding of meat, forming of patties and baking of buns on site, sauces and mayonnaise are prepared from scratch at Friends & Brgrs. This detailed approach also ensures that even the cooking methods are slightly more labour intensive than the average burger joint. “Our fries are made from fresh potatoes,” Fagerholm continues. “We do this according to the triple-cooked method, which we have developed a bit to handle the huge volumes. Usually this method is used in fine dining restaurants, in small amounts.” Much in the same way that a variety of ingredients come together to make up the perfect burger, the six founders of the company all hail from different industries, including digital marketing, logistics and meat-handling. What they do have in common, however, is a love of good food and shared roots in the Finnish town of Pietarsaari. According to Fagerholm, “the basics of good food start with great ingredients. ‘The fresher the better’ is our philosophy.” It was here that the pioneering site of Friends & Brgrs was established in 2014. A few months later the burger trail took them south to the capital and restaurants have been popping up gradually ever since. Last year saw the sextet heading abroad for the first time, with  ’s busy pedestrian mall, Strøget. The resultant word-of-mouth has been so positive that additional eateries overseas are on the cards. “We are now looking at locations in Germany and England,” Fagerholm outlines. “Our goal is to open two-to-three restaurants a year over the next few years.” In order to fund this growth, the company is putting its money where mouths are, after closing a   to the tune of almost one million euros (see video below). Fagerholm leans back and surveys the bustling Helsinki restaurant around him. Such was the strength of the original business idea that he admits to being unsurprised by the company’s success so far. However, the one thing that has raised an eyebrow is the fact that young women make up Friends & Brgrs’ main customer group. In contract to the male-focused, ‘bigger is better’ approach typically found in this sector, a remarkable share of Friends & Brgrs customers are female. With sales of 6.1 million euros last year, this demographic is certainly willing to pay a little bit extra for fresh flavours, served with genuine friendliness. “We educate our staff a lot and try to bring international way of providing service,” Fagerholm states. “We want people to feel special when they come here.” Among the company’s values hanging on the kitchen wall is a constant reminder of this approach: “We serve friends, not customers.” Listening to Fagerholm’s enthusiasm, one can’t help but hear echoes of  , the man who transformed McDonald’s from a two-man enterprise into one of the most recognised symbols of globalisation. Whilst Fagerholm doesn’t exhibit any of Kroc’s ruthlessness, nor his rampant desire to franchise, what they do share in common is a canny ability of knowing what people want. This is exactly what Friends & Brgrs has on the menu in future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/klinik-finland-takes-care-medical-efficiency/,Klinik Finland takes care of medical efficiency,"This Finnish online solution has been straightening care paths and reducing futile work for healthcare provision since it was founded in 2013. All of us go to a hospital or other health care provider with health problems. Some ailments are easier to diagnose, some harder. While you should not try brain surgery at home (can get messy), there are things you can do to straighten your care path. This is where the online health information solution of   kicks in for the benefit of all. “When people with health concerns go to the website of their local public health care provider that we partner with, at any time of the day, there will be a link there to our web service where they can specify all their symptoms by navigating through a query,” explains  , managing director of Klinik. “Our service then relays this information to the right counter, the system algorithms having determined severity and urgency, and the patient will be given an appointment accordingly.” This means that there is no more wasting time waiting on the phone, standing in line or figuring out who to turn to. “Those with less serious cases will receive self-care instructions based on the symptoms,” Nissinen continues. Klinik Finland seeks to provide clear clues about patients’ situation including relevant self-care guidance. Additionally, Klinik Finland’s solution helps tackle two common problems related to online health information. “The thing about Internet chat boards is that the emphasis of peer-to-peer health discussions tends to be on the unusual and serious cases, whereas the majority of people with corresponding symptoms but just minor issues or non-issues stay silent,” Nissinen states. “Klinik provides clear information in plain language to help laymen better determine what’s up with them.” The second scenario sees the use of difficult jargon in professional online sources, often leaving consumers visiting the website fearing for the worst. “One could say a communicative barrier exists between health care pros and patients,” Nissinen notes. “Our aim is to provide clear clues about the patient’s situation including relevant self-care guidance.” How do care professionals relate to such service that threatens to cut their patient queues and, potentially, income? “Every doctor and nurse wants to help their patients get well and stay well as efficiently and effortlessly as possible,” Nissinen says. “Our service benefits the public health care domain by helping to reduce work overload, such as that related to care need assessments made over the phone, which burden the system a lot.” The patient contacts coming via Klinik’s service only take around a couple of minutes to process and help to guide the patient straight to the right place, saving a lot of staff time on aggregate as well as patient waiting time and allowing the staff to focus on the patients. “That’s what we are about, not about redundancies in the sector,” Nissinen underlines. After news broke last year that the company had secured a 500 000- euro funding round, Klinik is now on the lookout for international business opportunities. When appropriate partners are found, Klinik is ready to adapt their system for different country-specific circumstances, including language versions. “Insurance companies or medical centre chains would be suitable partners for us abroad,” Nissinen says. And so, in the midst of burgeoning public healthcare costs, we should be happy to get all the help we can – and it seems that Klinik Finland can make it all less of a burden, indeed. “Our service benefits the public healthcare domain by helping to reduce work overload, such as that related to care need assessments made over the phone, which burden the system a lot,” states Nissinen (right)."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/26926/,Mapvision revs up ambitions for global expansion,"A Finnish technology company is transforming quality control in the automotive industry by making it digital, cost-effective and fast. Whichever car brand you prefer, the chances are some of its parts have been quality checked with Finnish technology. The in-line inspection system of Helsinki-based   is used by car giants such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and car part suppliers Gestamp and Magna to ensure the body and chassis components leaving their factories meet the highest requirements. “At the core of our operations is photogrammetry,” explains  , marketing and communications director at Mapvision. “We build photography-based inspection systems for measuring the geometry of car components. Our technology is unique globally and in the automotive industry we have found an application area where it really stands out from competition.” Typically, car components are inspected using sampling, where every thousand-or so-parts are taken to a laboratory for testing, but Mapvision brings digital inspection onto the production line itself. Its ‘Quality Gate’ system is placed at the end of the line and it photographs every single component to measure everything is the right shape and size. This means any anomalies are detected early, reducing the risk of costly errors later in the production process. Mapvision’s multi-camera technology stems from the Technical Research Centre of Finland VTT where it was developed until 1987, when Mapvision was formed to commercialise the technology. The first applications were across a range of industries, from shipbuilding to jet fighter wings, but since Mapvision introduced the Quality Gate in 2008 the automotive industry has been the company’s main focus. Mapvision’s Quality Gate system can measure complex welded car components within the production line’s typical cycle time of 30 seconds. And with good reason. Paakkola describes the automotive industry as the largest manufacturing industry in the world. While there are some competing systems, Mapvision says they are not a match for its technology which allows each car component to be inspected without slowing down the production cycle. “We talk about 100 per cent in-line measurement; we can measure everything needed from all components produced,” says Paakkola. “We are faster than any other system and our accuracy is on a par with laboratory measurements. Our customers have always had the need to measure all of their components, but it has not previously been possible.” While Mapvision has found its feet firmly on the car manufacturing market, it is only at the first stage of its master plan to ‘conquer the world’. The 50-employee strong company has established itself in China, Germany (which it describes as its home market) and the US, and is now working to strengthen its presence in Asia. These plans were boosted in June 2016 when Mapvision sold a minority share to Japanese metrology company Mitutoyo. Mapvision believes a local partner will help open doors to the famously challenging Japanese market, as well to other big car manufacturing countries in Asia. “We are a growth company and growth companies need funding. We are constantly investing in the future and product development,” explains Paakkola. “One of the reasons we wanted to work with Mitutoyo is that we want to have a strong presence in Asia and good access to those markets.” The long term goal for Mapvision is to expand from measuring components to entire car bodies. While this is still in the development, the company believes demand for in-line measuring will only grow in the automotive industry. “We want to be the number one globally in this kind of measuring,” Paakkola concludes. “It is a completely realistic goal; we just need to do the right things and do them well.” Mapvision’s in-line system enables car body and chassis parts to be digitally inspected and measured on the production line, making quality control fast and cost-effective."

Ranin, is one of the oldest family companies still up and running in Finland. Now it’s taking over Asia with an enthusiasm familiar from the startup scene. People sipping cocktails in Singapore and China might, without knowing it, be enjoying flavours coming from Finnish forests. Some connoisseurs, of course, are well familiar with where their cloudberry liqueur comes from. Antti Hynninen “In many corners of the world, Nordic seems to be a buzzword these days,” says  , export manager at  . “A lot of things coming from the Nordic countries and Scandinavia are gaining popularity.” Hynninen should know: the demand for the Lignell & Piispanen berry liqueurs and other products is rapidly growing, particularly in Asia. The history of Oy Gust. Ranin goes back all the way to the 1880s. Its founder,  , was one of the main actors in developing the culture of alcohol consumption in Finland. He started importing cognacs and wines from other European countries, which brought variety to the less classy home-made spirits Finns had been drinking until then. In the 1900s, Ranin purchased the business of two pharmacists from Kuopio, misters   and  . The duo had developed liqueurs, which were then passed onto Ranin’s responsibility. The receipt of one of the company’s most well-known products, Arctic bramble liqueur, has stayed almost exactly the same since its early days in 1882. The Asian conquest is a lot newer. It’s only been in the past decade that Lignell & Piispanen has properly hit the global booze business. In the 2000s, Lignell & Piispanen started to update its brand and existence with the international markets in mind. “We recreated and renewed a lot of our key features simply by challenging all of our earlier practices,” Hynninen describes. “We questioned whether we did things right in recipes, design, marketing… all of it.” Berries add a twist in the taste of liqueur. Lignell & Piispanen has also been actively involved in Finpro’s   programme. First the company gathered a foothold in Europe, and the Asian adventure began from Hong Kong in 2012. When it comes to alcohol, Asia differs from Finland in pretty much every aspect, from legislation to consumer habits and attitudes. Hynninen says the company worked extensively to make its approach fit the local demand. “We Finns have been a little slow in entering Asia,” he points out. “The French, Italians and Scots had started taking over before Nordic countries sent in the first orders.” In addition to the trendy Northern heritage, Lignell & Piispanen stands out in the crowd due to its unique story. This plays a huge role in the company’s success. “If we were only producing a mass item, there’d always be someone who can make it for a lower price,” Hynninen explains.” When we sell not only a product but also a story, we can offer a unique combination.” Lignell & Piispanen’s speciality is its understanding of the authentic Nordic berries. No artificial flavours, just genuine berries picked by hand, served in bottles designed in Finland. Despite turning 165 this year, Lignell & Piispanen has adopted a very startup style approach. Hynninen says the company is inspired by and functions like newborn companies. “We share the enthusiasm of a company that’s just commencing its journey,” Hynninen says. “We are constantly ready and willing to update our offering. Even if we already think our product is outstanding, we’re open to ways of making it even better.” Another startup-like aspect comes from staff. What began as a one-man show now employs almost two dozen people. Everyone’s ideas are listened to and appreciated. Cloudberry and tonic, anyone? Currently less than a half of the produce is exported. Alongside with Asia, many European countries get to fill their glasses with Lignell & Piispanen’s products. The first batch of bottles was sent to Kenya last summer, and other African countries might follow suit. Both Hynninen and CEO   spend a significant chunk of their time travelling and knocking on new doors. At the moment, the focus is on tapping the market Stateside. “We’ve received requests from the US, as the Nordic lifestyle is wildly popular across the Atlantic,” Hynninen says. “First we need to figure out all the red tape and regulations, but after that nothing is stopping us.” He’s been happy to see   in Finland have also fearlessly left the comfort of their home in search of new taste buds. “The drive and courage have reached new levels,” Hynninen notes. So too will many a traditional cocktail menu – with the help of Nordic flavours.    is published by Finnfacts, which is a part of Finpro."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/27154/,Chabla connects the deaf and interpreters for global communication,"Calling a friend or a doctor’s office can be a challenge when you rely on the availability of sign language interpreters. New mobile app Chabla has set out to change this. Over 750 000 people in the European Union are deaf or hard of hearing. This places significant strain on interpretation services for everyday communication and access to them varies greatly by region and language, often needing to be booked well in advance. These are exactly the challenges Finnish company Signmark Production wants to tackle with its mobile video calling app  . The app connects anyone using sign language directly with an international network of interpreters and enables its users to make and receive interpreted calls whenever they want. “Without Chabla it is almost impossible for someone who does not know sign language to call a deaf person,” says  , CEO of Signmark Productions. “I have heard this explanation many times from people who say they cannot communicate with me. This app not only empowers the sign language community but enables everyday communication.” So how does Chabla work in practice? The user opens the app, chooses who they want to call and which sign language they would like to use (there are hundreds of sign languages in the world) and waits for the app to find a suitable interpreter. When the interpreter is found, the call is connected to the recipient and charged on pay-per-minute basis. Chabla users can also have their own virtual number which allows them to receive interpreted calls. “It is very important that Chabla can be used in urgent situations,” Marko Vuoriheimo says. “For example, emergency calls are practically impossible for the deaf today in many countries Chabla stems from Vuoriheimo’s own experiences. Vuoriheimo was born deaf and today is best known as Signmark, the first deaf rapper to sign a recording deal with a major international label. But he grew tired of problems with calling and receiving calls from people who do not know sign language, so in 2015 started to develop Chabla in cooperation with IT services firm CGI. “I started to feel the same two problems: old technology and availability of interpreters have existed for a long time,” Vuoriheimo explains. “Now I can use the video calling service instantly and take care of errands in my own native language, signing.” A key focus in the development process has been to ensure Chabla works internationally and offers premium video quality. The service was tested with various user groups in different countries before it launched for iOS devices in Denmark, France, Finland, Germany and the UK last November. “The feedback has been very positive,” Vuoriheimo enthuses. “Mostly it has been about the technology. Many deaf people have used video calling services actively for a long time and they have noticed the likes of Skype and Facetime cannot compete with Chabla in video quality.” While Chabla’s primary target group is people using sign language, there is also growing demand for expanding the service to spoken languages. Vuoriheimo has already been approached by one country’s officials interested in offering interpreting services for immigrants through Chabla. “Many immigrants have said they would need a similar service for spoken languages so there is definitely demand for a multi-lingual service,” he explains. “It is a big potential customer base.” But while this might be a future addition, for now Signmark Productions’ focus is on continued development of Chabla, launching it for Android devices and raising funding to expand the app to new countries. It will also grow the app’s network of certified interpreters so it can eventually offer a truly 24/7 service everywhere. “Of course every entrepreneur’s dream is to have their product in every country,” Vuoriheimo says. “That people everywhere would have Chabla on their phones and especially people who have friends or relatives with different native languages, who would benefit from the service.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/coreflect-not-just-bright-shiny-new-object-2/,Coreflect is not just a bright shiny new object,"Safety Reflector Finland and its product Coreflect are prime examples of the Finnish imagination and aptitude for modification. In Finland, Mother Nature has always been tough and respected. It has reshaped Finns’ ability to innovate to survive, especially during winter. These days, this approach has evolved in a way that people can live side by side with nature and utilise it in different ways, such as the newly opened ice road in   – the longest official inland ice road in Europe. Another eye-opening Finnish invention for the colder months is the humble safety reflector. Its origins reflect back to the 1950s, when farmer  ’s horse and carriage was struck by a passing car on a dark road, and understandably spurred his desire to be more noticeable in future. The resultant dangling pieces of small plastic have since sold more than 100 million units all over the world. “The purpose of a reflector is to ensure that you are visible in the traffic, and to prevent accidents and even deaths,” explains  , CEO of  . “Safety reflectors are used in the dark, anywhere where you move on foot or by bike.” “A driver can spot a pedestrian with a reflector up to three times further away than a pedestrian not wearing one,” says Jutta Vainio. Manufacturing of this Finnish invention has continued in its homeland ever since the 1960s. More recently, Safety Reflector Finland has been responsible for the product development of   reflectors since last year, along with their storage, distribution, and sales and marketing. “It is very important for us that the manufacturing stays in Finland, because that way we can control the whole process,” Vainio explains, having herself purchased the Coreflect rights from  . “We already have a reputation as a reliable partner, since the product has been on the market for a long time. Production is frequently monitored and reflectivity values of each lot is documented.” In keeping with Finnish eco-friendly values, the reflectors are made of polystyrene, which can be recycled, and do not contain any substances or compounds that are harmful for people or nature. “We are at the forefront of quality assurance in reflector manufacturing,” says Vainio. “Our reflectors are approximately twice as efficient as other reflectors on the market.” This latest chapter for Coreflect has seen approximately two million reflectors being sold during its first six months on the market as a Safety Reflector Finland product. “I am satisfied with this start,” outlines Vainio. “Earlier, Coreflects have been sold mainly to global promotional markets, but at the beginning of this year we launched a totally new look for our retail collection, which we expect to be successful.” New Coreflect collections are released annually. A Finn based in Italy, Sini Hirvonen from Finnissima, is one of the designers of the latest collection. The demand for reflectors is steadily growing due to a number of factors. For example, in Finland, Poland and the Baltic countries it is against the law not to wear safety reflectors in the dark. A similar act recently entered into force in the Czech Republic. “The World Health Organisation is seriously trying to reduce road accidents,” Vainio says. “These new laws are linked to WHO’s attempts, which is wonderful. Our reflectors used to be given to schoolchildren in England nationwide, and in Bulgaria 30 000 safety reflectors are distributed similarly each year.” Vainio herself has been representing Coreflect-reflectors in large retail and wholesale trades in Germany, UK, Bulgaria, Norway, Sweden and Russia for almost 10 years. Reflectors have also been sold anywhere from North and South America, to Japan, South Korea and Australia. “The media sometimes conveys the impression that people do not know what a safety reflector is,” Vainio states. “I disagree. In these large fairs in Europe, people are well aware of these products. How else we could have delivered over 100 million pieces already?” As the international sales of this innovation continue their upward trajectory, this reflects the growing number of people globally who can be seen to be a bit more Finnish."

This web-based service enables travellers to stay with local families in Africa and Asia. There’s a philanthropic angle too: the majority of the accommodation fee goes to the host family, with the rest divided up between the community’s village bank and Duara. “We want travellers to see where their money goes and how their trip affects the life of the local community,”    , one of Duara’s three founders.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/twodads-two-one-content-less-sugar/,"TwoDads’ two-for-one: More content, less sugar","Parents across the world all want the same thing – to enable their kids to grow happy, healthy and smart. Finnish company TwoDads is here to help them out, by making it easier to find healthy and nutritious everyday foods. Too much sugar and salt, too little fibre and wrong kinds of fat.   and  the founders of  , weren’t happy with the nutritional content of children’s food in local supermarkets. There were elements of cognitive dissonance, too. The paternal duo were marketing professionals, and they had been working in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. This included helping to boost the sales of multinational corporations’ food brands. Then both men became fathers. “We didn’t want to give our kids the same products that we were helping companies to market to parents,” Singh recalls. “We asked ourselves: What company could we trust as parents to put our kids’ interest before shareholder value? We looked around the shelves in supermarkets and we couldn’t find one.” The consequences of the industry putting money before kids’ health is dramatic. According to the World Health Organisation,   public health challenges of our time.  The two fathers thus decided to take matters into their own hands, and set out to establish the first healthy kids’ food company in Finland. Singh and Kuusisto were quick to admit that they were no experts in nutrition or food manufacturing. Fortunately, a friend suggested they seek help from the University of Helsinki. Much to their surprise and delight, the scientists at the university loved the idea and were soon onboard. TwoDads aims to make the healthy option an easy one for families. “We were also lucky to find a leading European expert in diabetes, doctor  , who joined the cause and brought in his peers from various fields of medical science,” Singh tells. Through their cooperation, TwoDads then collected seed funding for kick-starting product development. Amongst other things their research underlined the fact that breakfast is the first meal where healthy options are sorely needed. Thus, the inaugural item they are hoping to stock supermarket shelves with later this year is cereal. Although porridge and cereal are often deemed healthy options, the lion’s share of them are actually often packed with sugar. “Many big companies want to convey the perception of healthiness without explicitly claiming the product is healthy,” Singh explains. “We know ­– that’s what we used to do for a living!” TwoDads aims to make the healthy option an easy one, too. Often parents are the ones left feeling guilty about their kids’ poor nutrition, whereas Singh wants to make producers and shops more responsible. Because the morning hours can be busy and full of hassle, healthy choices need to be easy and speedy for all. Aside from filling kid’s cereal bowls with a healthy alternative, the next products in the pipeline for TwoDads are juices and other staple foods. Now, after completing the product development together with food manufacturers, it’s time to get the production capacity ready. The dads have also stoked the interest of potential customers and travelled to fairs abroad to promote their doing. The goal is to start distribution in the Nordic countries, and then move on to the rest of Europe and Asia. As the food business is capital intensive, the entrepreneurs have been negotiating with investors to fund the operation. The production needs to reach volumes that enable keeping prices low, so that the end products are a financially viable option for all family shoppers. Furthermore, in addition to health, TwoDads want to spread the Nordic gender equality and highlight the role of dads in caring for their children. Even in Finland, there is a lot of magazine and forum content on offer for mums, but dads might still find it difficult to find peer support. Thanks to the efforts of TwoDads, fathers around the world can rest assured they aren’t the only gents on the lookout for what’s best for their offspring in future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/auntie-smoothens-curves-life/,Auntie smoothens the curves of life,"We all go through a crisis every now and then, be it big or small. Finnish healthtech service Auntie wants to help tackle life’s issues before they grow too big. Answering work emails at 2 am? Difficulties with the teenager in the household? Communicating with the spouse mainly by making snarky comments?  co-founder   wanted to do something to help people juggling with whatever trouble life has thrown their way. Auntie, a preventive therapy service that combines digital and live sessions, acts as a middle ground between booking face-to-face psychotherapy appointments and relying on self-help tools. “Auntie isn’t for people with clinical mental disorders, as they require a different level of professional care,” Lamminen points out. “Whilst helping people, we also want to contribute to the availability of low-threshold services and, in general, help remove the stigma that unfortunately can still surround seeking therapy.” Tangled up in responsibilities? Auntie knows the feeling. Auntie’s focus is always on a particular knot in life that needs untangling, such as feeling overworked, having trouble coping with big changes at work or marital problems. The user chooses a package that suits his or her needs, and after a couple of short surveys have been filled out, the first virtual meeting with a professional therapist is booked. The different packages include a maximum of five live sessions each. On top of the virtual meetings, the user receives digital content and resources, such as articles, assignments and practice materials. The company’s main target is big companies with plentiful workforce. Companies buy a certain number of session packages for their employees. Their progress is measured through surveys and, if there are enough participants to guarantee the users’ anonymity, then the data is delivered to the employer to prove the efficiency of the service. Auntie is also interested in looking into utilising the measuring techniques wearable technology can offer. Lamminen sees Auntie’s potential market growing continuously. She’s noticed that firms are beginning to focus their employee wellbeing efforts on prevention and early intervention. “Unfortunately, humankind isn’t running out of crises,” she says. “What’s changing now is that people, including employers, better understand that doing situps and pushups doesn’t suffice to ensure people are well and fit for work.” Currently Auntie has signed contracts with customers in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands. In Finland, the original trio of founders has grown into a team of about 10 owners, and Auntie is looking into expanding its team with sales professionals and service coordinators. Therapists aren’t directly employed by Auntie, but all freelancers and other service providers, regardless of their location, are always trained to ensure standardised procedure. “Because we’re a digital service, our therapists don’t need to live in expensive London; instead, they can live in Thailand,” Lamminen explains. “They do need to be native speakers of the customer’s language, but with Auntie, geography doesn’t matter.” Auntie’s offering is covering new topics all the time. Some of them are specific to the types of work people are doing, like helping call centre staff deal with the pressures of customer complaints. “For example, nurses and other health workers have their own challenges,” Lamminen says. “You have to be empathetic all the time, even if you yourself would be in need of comforting.” Lamminen believes that reaching out for help with mental health issues is getting more and more common, and hence it’s no longer a total taboo in all office coffee rooms. She points out that previously, having a personal trainer at the gym was seen as something special and luxurious, but now it’s normal. “We want the same for Auntie and other preventive mental health services,” she tells. “People make it through a divorce alive, but with Auntie’s help, there’s no need to let yourself hit the rock bottom before starting to climb back up again.” New Auntie session packages are developed all the time."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/daily-dose-roberts-berrie/,A daily dose from Roberts Berrie,"These Nordic berries are produced in a preservable way so that their taste and salubriousness can be luxuriated anywhere in the world, all year round. The Finnish summer condenses all that is good into a short period of time. Amongst other things, the warmer months ripen a delicious harvest of berries housed in one of the cleanest forests in the world. These natural creations are full of nutrient-rich, appetising square meal fragments that can be gathered for free, if one dares to step out in the wild. Now everyone are able to enjoy these Nordic delights just as they were picked. Roberts, a family enterprise based in Turku for the past 106 years, has pioneered the next generation line of high-quality berry products. The company has come up with a way to refine whole natural Nordic berries into a delicious “shot” that keeps at room temperature. “The great innovation behind all this is the standardisation of the berries,” says company CEO  . “By standardisation, I mean that we can, for example, guarantee the conservation of bilberries for eight months. Thereby, the availability of berries is constant and we are not dependent on the harvest or location.” This means that consumers can enjoy their servings of daily berries with ease wherever and whenever they like. Roberts Berrie distinguishes itself from the pack by utilising the whole berry during the drink-making process. Roberts also manufactures products under the Moomin brand name. “For us, it used to be a challenge to convey to people the understanding of what we are doing,” Roberts explains. “We are selling the daily berries, not just some juice or smoothie. As we are using the whole berries, our product includes all the skins and seeds. It is a real deal.” And, what is the reason for this? It’s simple: most of the healthy polyphenol compounds are found in the skin and seeds of berries. The origins of this nutrient-packed berry innovation dates back to last decade. “Today, the health impact of berries is universal knowledge,” Roberts tells. “The first Berrie products were refined a couple of years ago, while we continued to develop jams and other products. Since then, we have further advanced the recipe, brand, packaging etc. The progress has been intensive.” Roberts Berrie is now comprised of three product families. One is for children, another a variety of berry-based delicacies, and thirdly Berrie+, which has different functional purposes, such as a protein boost. “A 100 millilitre cup of our Wild Bilberry product contains the equivalent of 139 bilberries and other ingredients such as sweetening apple extract, citrus fibre and lemon juice, to balance the taste without losing the healthfulness,” Roberts clarifies. “There is no added white sugar.” The Berrie range represents the latest feather in the cap for the Roberts’ century in the food business. Earlier, the company was focused on business-to-business dealings, mostly in the domestic market, producing jams, marmalades and fillings for Finnish retailers, baking professionals and Horeca industries and customers abroad. The traditional family enterprise has an annual turnover of around 10 million euros and manufactures all of their products at its own plant in Turku. Roberts is now undergoing a transformation process, as it is reaches the shores of the international market and consumers. “I would say these are the biggest changes that a company can experience,” says Roberts. Roberts Berrie already has a foothold in USA and China and orders on its online store are growing in number, especially in Europe. The company has achieved much international recognition for its innovations, and the products have even been featured in a Super Bowl ad. “We have achieved worldwide visibility in recent months without targeting our advertising,” Roberts explains. “We do not specify our products to any demographic target group. Berrie products are designed for anyone who are interested in nutrition and wants to take care of their health.” As Finland is considered the world leader in the development of functional and health-enhancing foods, it is also a cradle for many naturally nutrition-rich food products. The bright, yet short, northern summer here provides this great variety of superfoods from the forest, which, for us Finns, are simply known as just ‘daily berries’. All the berries that Roberts Berrie uses come from the taiga and other northern areas of growth not too far from Finland, wherein the flavonoids are the finest."

It was the mother-in-law’s fault. The childhood home of  ’s fiancée   was gutted by a fire because they left a mobile phone charger plugged into the wall. “My mother-in-law asked me why I wasn’t inventing a charger which you can safely leave plugged in,” Saloranta says. “I told her that it was impossible. Companies like Nokia have already tried and failed. Then two years later I woke up in the middle of the night because I got an idea how to do it. What you do to make your mother-in-law happy!” Asmo Solutions’ namesake has been dubbed the most sophisticated mobile charger ever built. His company’s solution is the  , which has been dubbed the most sophisticated mobile charger ever built. Most chargers still use energy if they are plugged into an electrical socket even when they aren’t charging a phone. This wastes a small amount of energy but is also a fire hazard, as Saloranta’s in-laws discovered. Thus the Asmo Charger is switches off automatically when the phone is unplugged from it. “It is completely isolated from the electric grid, just as if you had unplugged it,” Saloranta explains. “But the magic here is the Asmo Charger also switches back on automatically when you plug your phone back in.” The charger uses a solution which sounds simple but actually took an enormous amount of work to develop. It uses the phone battery to power open the relay, which then makes the energy start to flow and charges the battery. When the phone is removed from the charger the relay stops. Asmo Solutions has received venture funding, but it has relied heavily on crowdfunding to get its idea developed and into people’s hands. In the summer of 2015 they raised about 93 000 US dollars on Indiegogo and in the autumn of 2016 they gathered almost 1.3 million euros on Privanet’s private investor platform. Yet these efforts are not just about raising money. “There are a lot of different reasons why I had a crowdfunding campaign,” Saloranta continues. “You get publicity, funding, pre-orders and market research. Crowdfunding can drive or stop your idea. Both are good. If people do not buy your project there is no good reason to continue that idea as a business.” The Indiegogo campaign induced almost 1 500 backers to pluck down money for an initial charger. The big players in the industry also took notice. Soon manufacturers began to contact Saloranta. The current version of the charger is for devices with a micro USB connector. They expect to have a model for Apple products in the summer of 2017. To help lead Asmo Solutions Saloranta recruited  , the former head of mobile technology company  . “Now I have the opportunity and resources to design new products which make our lives safer, easier and more sustainable,” Saloranta concludes. “It has been both a horrible and awesome ride. I failed hundreds of times while doing this, but for every failure there was a lesson. Many people ask if I would have done things differently, but I say hell no! If I changed something, would this still be a success?”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-wood-innovations/,Five for Friday: Wood innovations,"Given that Finland has the densest coverage of forest in the world, it’s probably no surprise then that wood has been an integral part of its industry over the centuries. But it’s not all log cabins and saunas. Here are some more recent offerings from local companies. After opening the plant in early 2015, this Finnish company set about trailing their wood-based diesel fuel in field tests with urban buses in Helsinki. “We are especially delighted to be able to take part in the Helsinki Region Transport initiative that aims for emission free public transport,” sales and marketing director at UPM Biofuels    . “One of the major targets of the initiative is to start using 100 per cent renewable biofuels in their diesel vehicles in the coming years.” Taking its name from a Swedish can of tuna, Tonfisk primarily manufactures coffee and tea sets, and its bent wood product range is growing year by year. “The wooden part of our products is not just for decorative purposes; there is always a reason why it’s used,” co-founder    . “For example, the wooden portion acts as insulation, keeping the drink warm without letting your hands burn.” Under the brand name Lastu, this company manufactures accessories for mobile devices made from renewable materials, using six species of Finnish wood. “The most popular type of wood is Curly Birch, which appeals especially to Finns and Swedes. Grey-dyed birch, which we call Kelo, has also sold really well,” CEO  . “A wide variety of colours is something we want to keep.” Born in 2010 when a pair of engineers noticed how phone calls contribute to a noisy office environment, here resides a quiet place made of wood that affords callers privacy, as well as reduces distractions for everyone else. “Design is enormously important,” sales manager    . “When creating inspiring spaces there is no room for awkward design or products.” Manufactured from an eco-friendly composite material of wood and biodegradable plastic, this company’s Woodcast casting and splinting products are suitable for all orthopaedic and traumatology uses, including the casting and splinting of fractures and injuries. “I feel that this patent protected technology has the features set to achieve a significant share of the cast product market in the big five EU countries and the United States,”  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/space-nation-aims-stars/,Space Nation aims for the stars,"The community lead by the Finnish company Cohu Experience has exceedingly high ambitions: it wants to make space travel accessible – to anyone. “Shooting for the stars” may be a cliché in the start-up world, but in the case of   the expression turns out to be entirely accurate: the initiative aims to help open up space travel to the general public. The project’s first major announcement happened at   in December, where the first participating organisations from the space industry were revealed. However,  , the Finnish company leading the efforts, has been developing the initiative under the radar already for a couple of years. The larger context behind Space Nation is the commercialisation of space flight, which is making space travel increasingly affordable. According to  , CEO and co-founder of Cohu Experience, development of technology and investment in the space industry is now bringing the price of space travel down, and it won’t take long until it will be accessible also to non-millionaires: “Most people don’t realise how quickly this development is taking place.” Space Nation aims to become a key actor in the commercial space flight area in the long run. The first phase of Space Nation will be its astronaut training programme, which is set to kick off later this year with the launch of a mobile application. With the app, participants will be able to practice the physical and mental skills necessary for space travel, ranging from social and teamwork abilities to problem-solving and decision-making skills. Anyone from around the world can download the app and take part, and the participants with the best scores will eventually be invited to a physical boot camp, followed by a three-month training process. The candidates will compete against one another, with the winner getting a trip to space as the prize. “Many presume that to fly to space you need superhero physique and intelligence, but in reality, acquiring the required skills is not so demanding,” Vähä-Jaakkola says. Space Nation plans to turn the astronaut training programme into an annual competition: the first year one person will win a suborbital flight, but once orbital flights become affordable in a few years, the winners will spend more time in space. A company with a staff of 15, Cohu Experience has put together a wide network of organisations in the space industry to make Space Nation possible. Axiom Space, for instance, provides astronaut training and flight opportunities, and is building a commercial space station where Space Nation astronauts will be sent to in the future. Also NASA provides training and educational material. More partnerships will be announced during this year. In addition to training astronauts, Space Nation aims to become a key actor in the commercial space flight area in the long run. “Our ambition is to create a new moonshot phenomenon, like what happened in the ‘60s,” Vähä-Jaakkola says. “We’re aiming to help give a unifying vision, goal and purpose that would accelerate the development of the space industry generally.” With space opening up to commercial opportunities, Vähä-Jaakkola points out that the potential is immense. “We aim to become the missing link between the industry, brands and the general public.” Sounds ambitious, to say the least, but Cohu Experience is drawing inspiration from earlier Finnish success stories. “When we started the project,   and   were encouraging examples,” Vähä-Jaakkola says. “They help show that even wild ideas can be achieved, you just need to be dedicated and work hard.” Vähä-Jaakkola himself is naturally interested in going to space: “Since I was a little boy I’ve thought that astronauts will eventually not only visit space, but live there to work and do scientific research. I’d like to be one of those people.” With space opening up to commercial opportunities, “We aim to become the missing link between the industry, brands and the general public,” declares Vähä-Jaakkola (pictured at the Slush launch last year)."

Meanwhile, your son says he needs to tell you something about the school play, but can’t find the letter which he brought home. A call to the kindergarten only results in more confusion. If you think it is hectic managing the schedules of your kids, imagine how it is for the teachers trying to communicate all this information. Taina Mikkola sought to develop a digital solution to make daily routines smoother. “As we followed the kindergarten life closely and interviewed early education professionals and families, we started to wonder how we could help teachers make their life easier at work,” says  . “Could there be some new digital way to solve some of the challenges and make daily routines smoother?” Since Mikkola didn’t find anything to her liking, she decided to solve the problem herself.

Next we will take the first steps in the international markets and do market testing in selected areas.” The learning service aims to provide access to the best practices of Finnish early education to everyone working with young children.

The small team is continually developing the app based on feedback they receive. “The user experience is the most important,” Mikkola confirms. “TinyApp needs to support teachers and parents in their daily life in an easy and usable way.” The idea has already received a lot of attention and the company was a national finalist for the StartUp Europe Award. This is all the more remarkable because the company has yet to really show its hand. “Our journey started here in Finland, where we closely collaborate with Finnish nurseries to create shared understanding of the best practices in early education,” Mikkola concludes. “We have already launched a TinyApp communication application for teachers and families, we have held online training and now we will make the best practices of high quality Finnish early education accessible worldwide.” TinyApp includes all the essentials for communication between a day care and family: calendars and reminders, messaging, profiles and status."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-apps-help-prevent-strokes-heart-attacks/,Finnish mobile apps help prevent strokes and heart attacks,"Nowadays you can find a mobile app for almost anything and some of them can even save your life. Now Finnish researchers have made it possible to use your phone to detect a heart attack or early signs of a stroke. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death globally, killing over 17 million  . Early detection saves lives but often the first symptoms of a heart attack are confused with heartburn or transient chest pain, something University of Turku researchers think they can solve. Their new mobile app can spot the warning signs early and alert its users. “Smartphones have very sensitive built-in motion sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes, that measure the phone’s movement,” explains  , project manager at Turku University’s  . “Our app uses these same sensors to measure micro-movements caused by heart beats instead.” In practice this means if you are feeling unwell you simply open the app, place the phone on your chest and the app does the rest. It uses a proprietary machine learning algorithm to analyse any signs of a heart attack and within a few minutes, if cause for concern is found, encourages the patient to seek medical advice. In TRC’s studies the app detected heart attack related problems accurately over 70 per cent of the time and the researchers believe over 90 per cent accuracy can be achieved if the app has previously recorded the patient’s baseline data. TRC’s research team has studied the use of sensor technology for measuring heart movements in close collaboration with the Turku University Hospital since 2011. Mobile apps are only one, but a significant part of this. This is a highly cost-effective and easy way to detect atrial fibrillation. “These are multidisciplinary projects where you need to combine for instance medical, electronics, algorithm and software expertise,” Koivisto says. “A mobile app may sound like it is fast to do, but behind it is a lot of research.” In August the team used the same smartphone sensor technology to announce an app for detecting atrial fibrillation, a major cause of brain strokes. 70 per cent of these could be avoided with pre-emptive medication, but the challenge is atrial fibrillation often has very little, if any, noticeable symptoms. TRC’s mobile app tackles this by detecting unusual heart rhythm without any extra equipment or expensive medical devices. The test can be done anywhere by placing the phone on the user’s chest and results are ready just as quickly as the heart data. “This is a highly cost-effective and easy way to detect atrial fibrillation,” explains Koivisto. “The method can also be used for screening large populations as there are over two billion smartphone users in the world. In future, a secure cloud service could be created to store and analyse larger masses of data.” But getting TRC’s mobile apps to the public is no easy matter given the serious health conditions they address: “All the necessary permit processes cannot happen inside a few months,” explains Koivisto. “Our aim is to have the apps on the market in a year’s time.” With this timescale in mind the research team knows its next steps. Negotiations have already begun with potential investors and the hope is to spin-off a commercial company in 2017. “Commercialisation has always been a central goal in TRC’s operations,” Koivisto says. “We want to focus on research topics that are significant on a societal level and new on a global scale.” TRC’s mobile apps uses a smartphone’s built-in motion sensors which means they are cheap, easy to use anywhere and no extra equipment is needed."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nordic-travel-fair-wants-you-to-come-to-finland/,Nordic Travel Fair wants you to come to Finland,"This weekend, Helsinki Exhibition and Convention Centre will be packed with travel enthusiasts participating in the Nordic Travel Fair. Good News from Finland popped by to see what Finland has to offer for the year to come. We expected plenty of fuss about and around Finland: various publications, including   and  , have listed Finland as one of the top destinations for 2017. We were anything but disappointed, as there were plenty of people on hand to convince us that Finland is the go-to destination. The trend isn’t dying, and soon Finland will be branding itself as a place for relaxing. Finpro’s   and its   programme have chosen top 25 wellbeing products, and Culture Finland has nominated top 20 products in the field of culture, from among the over 200 products that took part in a product development competition. The winners represent Finland as a wellbeing and culture travel destination, and the final products will be sent to the European and Asian markets with the help of Visit Finland. The   is being held from 19-22 January. Ilse Klockars, marketing manager at Hanko Tourism, thinks the Finnish archipelago is fantastic. “There are so many places full of peace, authenticity and wellbeing with a short journey from Helsinki yet still off the beaten path,” she notes. “They offer people living in the busy metropolises in Central Europe an opportunity to calm down in the quietness.” She thinks Hanko is particularly special, because it’s mainland and archipelago at the same time. “You get sea views from three directions.” Visit Lahti sales manager Harri Olenius says the city of Lahti is most well-known for its winter sports scene. Often foreign tourists head first to its ski jumping towers. The upcoming World Ski Championships are, of course, a magnet for people into snowy sporting.  However, it’s not the only thing that’s great about the town. “We’re the gateway to the lakeside of Finland,” Olenius points out. “Also, we’re very easy to get to from the capital, but surrounded by beautiful nature.” Visit Åland’s cruise and marketing manager Sari Venho and sales and marketing coordinator Outi Virtanen were at the fair to remind travellers about Åland’s amazingness. The island between Finland and Sweden might not be big in size or population, but it boasts a vast variety of activities. “Everything is conveniently located near everywhere else, and cycling around is very popular among travellers,” the ladies say. “Despite the tranquillity of the island, there are plenty of festivals and event, particularly in the summer time.” Chocolate or liquorice, anyone? Orkla Confectionery & Snacks was at the fair promoting its brands: Taffel for crisps and Panda for sweets. Panda liquorice is available in stores around the world, and account manager Maija Torppa (front) knows it’s a treat not only for Finns living abroad, but foreigners too. “It only has four ingredients, nothing artificial.”  The company has redesigned its Finland-branded chocolate boxes in honour of the 100th anniversary celebrations. According to Torppa, Panda’s Finland-chocolates are one of the most popular sweets at Helsinki Airport. Not anyone would use the slogan “in the middle of nowhere” in their tourism marketing. Well, Salla in Lapland isn’t just anyone. Heli Karjalainen, marketing officer from Salla’s tourism office, says the idea is to be authentic and honest. “We are very much in the middle of nowhere – there are no city lights within a 100-kilometre radius.” She points out that every activity the village can offer to tourists is based on genuine, original things from the village. “Be it snowshoes or snowmobiles, they’re a part of the survival of the people in the area. Also, guides are almost always people originally from Salla.” Ähtäri Zoo CEO Jukka Haapaniemi agreed to pose for a photo with a red panda. Soon, if all goes to plan, Ähtäri will have giant pandas roaming in its enclosures. That will increase the attractiveness of the zoo, as there are only a handful of giant pandas in European zoos.  Haapaniemi points out that Ähtäri hosts over 60 endangered Northern species in its over 60-hectare park area. He reminds that Finland provides giant pandas with an environment close to their natural habitat, which is the case with most of Ähtäri’s animals in general.  The region has other things to do, too. “Tuuri shopping centre and PowerPark amusement park are very near, so there are a lot of activities for, for example, families with children.” The Karelian pie made it to the third spot on the list of national foods, losing only to Karelian hot pot and the winner, rye bread. Anna-Liisa Karpathakis from bakery A-L Sorsa served all sorts of variations of both the pie and rye at the fair. She’s noticed that Asian tourists often go for the traditional pie that’s filled with rice pudding, and many Western visitors opt for the potato one. “For a lot of foreigners, rye is something quintessentially Finnish.” Portuguese journalist Claudia Carvalho from travel magazine ‘Volta ao Mundo’ attended a Finnfacts media tour. She had never been to Finland before, and this is the case with a lot of other Portuguese people, too. “Finland is quite an unknown destination in Portugal,” she tells. During the first couple of days of her busy visit, she’s noticed people have been very friendly and lively – which, she admits, came as a bit of a surprise. “People are cheerful and active even outdoors, although it’s so cold, at least for us!” A cardboard cutout of a reindeer was there, too. Because why not!    is published by Finnfacts, which is a part of Finpro."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-modern-day-composers-and-conductors/,Five for Friday: Modern-day composers and conductors,"Whilst Finnish classical music history is rightfully dominated by the presence of Jean Sibelius, rest assured there are a number of more recent ‘upstarts’ stepping out of his sizeable shadow. Back in 2015 we reported that the Royal Opera House has   from this Finnish composer, with contemporary writer Sofi Oksanen as the librettist. The curtain is set to go up on the opera in 2020 in Covent Garden. Winner of both the Polar Music Prize and a Grammy, these are but two of the numerous accolades bestowed upon the Paris-based composer. Recently named as the chief conductor of Deutsche Radio Philharmonie in Germany, Inkinen has also been the chief conductor of the Prague Symphony Orchestra, the Ludwigsburg Schlossfestspiele and the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. On top of this, he is the honorary conductor of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. “I am thrilled to become the new chief conductor of the Deutsche Radio Philharmonie,” he  . “Since our first collaboration together in 2010, I have always felt a strong connection with the musicians and I look forward to strengthening this bond even further.” Where to start for the towering achievements of this composer-conductor? He is currently the principal conductor and artistic advisor for London’s Philharmonia Orchestra and the conductor laureate for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, where he was also music director from 1992 until 2009. Not to mention he is in the midst of three seasons as the  . Phew. Salonen hasn’t forgotten his roots and is also artist in association at the Finnish National Opera and Ballet. Additionally, he is also artistic director and cofounder of the annual Baltic Sea Festival. This 30-year old conductor was recently hailed by  as “the latest sit-up-and-listen talent to emerge from the great Finnish conducting tradition”. With this in mind, Rouvali is picking up the baton as chief conductor of Sweden’s GSO at the beginning of the 2017-18 season. “With his dynamic youthfulness and phenomenal energy, Santtu-Matias Rouvali represents something we firmly believe to be the future in the world of classical music,”    , general manager and artistic director of the Gothenburg Symphony. Last year was nothing short of most memorable for this renowned conductor. Selected as  , Mälkki was also recently honoured as a Chevalier in the Order of the Légion d’Honneur, which is the highest decoration in France. Looking for further proof? Musical America describes “the hallmark of a Mälkki performance” as being “the fresh expressiveness she brings to music whether new or old”. Check out our   from last year."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/teija-is-all-about-detail/,TEIJA is all about detail,"The London-based Finnish designer Teija Eilola has been away from her birthland for almost two decades, yet still carries and spreads the Nordic spirit in her fashion. On the phone,   keeps slipping in English words.  ,  ,  ,   – she’s speaking Finnish, but at times it’s a struggle to relocate specific terms. No wonder: she’s been living in the UK for almost 20 years, ever since her late teens. During her undergraduate studies she spend a year in France, but London’s been her home for a long time now. “It’s not that I didn’t like the idea of moving back to Finland,” she notes. “It’s just that there’s always been work available here.” Eilola has indeed kept herself busy after finishing her two-year master’s degree at the Royal College of Art. Having worked for and with various companies, including the likes of  , throughout her career, four years ago Eilola decided to create her own very own brand. Teija Eilola in her North London studio. The thought had been simmering in the back of her mind for a long time, but the final push was the Fashion Fringe competition. Being among the final three, Eilola suddenly had a place in a mentoring program, support, funding for completing the collection in the making and exhibition space. Looking back on it, it was like a three-month business course. “When it ended, I had to stand on my own two feet,” she reminiscences. “I remember feeling pretty scared; for years I’d been working for others, and then I had to start contemplating the identity and existence of my own brand. The moment you start your own brand you feel all self-confident, but then the doubts hit you!” After careful consideration and battling with insecurities,   items were seen in its first fashion show. Suddenly Eilola had three stores selling her products: one in Hong Kong, one in Tokyo and one in London. “That was really encouraging, on top of all the private customers,” she recalls. Since then, her global scope has grown a lot broader. Currently TEIJA collections are for sale in about 60 stores worldwide, including France, the US, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Japan and Korea. TEIJA design stands out in these diverse landscapes due to its attention to detail. Eilola admires atelier-style production and careful, even labour-intensive techniques. “Some of the techniques can require plenty of work, but they make a real difference in the end product.” Eilola has never been afraid of hands-on work, as sewing and designing have been integral parts of her life. This is thanks to her childhood, as her mother was keen on clothes, too. As early as at the age of eight, she said she wanted to become a fashion designer. TEIJA design stands out due to its attention to detail. Eilola, despite being taught and trained abroad, still carries Finland in her work. She calls the style of the cuts in her designs “Nordic minimalistic”. She also points out how practicality and high quality have always been appreciated in Finland: Finns aren’t fond of the overly fancy. “I like keeping my design relaxed. Although the products are sold in design boutiques, they don’t need to be evening dresses; instead, you can wear them in the office.” She also wants to have consistency in her work. TEIJA launches four collections a year, and if a customer buys one piece in April and another one in November, the styles still match. The clothes are produced in a few different countries in Europe and India. Eilola also has both full-time employees, international collaborators and a pool of freelancers working for the brand. She would like to partner up with some Finnish fashion actors, too. “I’ve always been intrigued by what’s going on in the Finnish fashion scene,” she notes. “When I was young, Finland was more known for architecture and other fields of design, but now I can stumble across a Finnish clothing brand in a shop in Paris”. Concrete future plans always depend on what happens next and what projects come her way. The fashion world can be unpredictable. “Often what I do can be a surprise to myself, too. To me, the most important thing is to develop my brand steadily and be able to spend time on the details of the design. Everything else is a bonus.” Currently TEIJA collections are for sale in about 60 stores worldwide."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/26440/,Finland demolishes rivals with ocean liner recycling project,"When a ship comes to the end of its life-cycle, most of its materials are still recyclable and worth millions of euros. A new Finnish consortium believes this could become a major business for the country’s maritime and recycling industry. Currently most ocean liners are taken apart in Southern Asia, but at times in questionable working conditions. An upcoming EU directive aims to change this by requiring all ships sailing under European flags to undergo certified demolition. For the Finnish maritime industry this is a major opportunity, as it has significant experience in handling large ships in a way that is sustainable both for the environment and workers. “We have strong shipbuilding expertise, shipyard capacity and circular economy know-how,” says  , project manager at the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). “This forms a great base for the ship demolition industry.” Tekes is funding a new ‘Ship Recycling’ project in cooperation with a consortium of Finnish companies to turn this expertise into an ocean liner demolition industry in the country. The first pilot demolition project is currently under discussion and is planned to begin in late 2017.  talked with three companies in the consortium about their part in project. Currently no EU country has demolition sites for ships over 100 metres long, but the   (TRY) in Southwest Finland is ready to change that. Its dry dock is 265 metres long and 70 metres wide making it an ideal location for large ships. On a typical year, the company handles the repair and maintenance of over 150 ships, from tankers to passenger ferries. “The biggest ships we have repaired have been crude oil tankers,” recalls  , project manager at TRY. “Demolition is largely project management and that is our expertise. Also, we already have environmental certificates for ship repairs so we only need a few extra clearances to start demolitions.” A major focus area for TRY is to minimise its environmental impact and this is the approach the company wants to apply to ship demolition as well. If the first pilot project in 2017 goes well, the aim is to first have up to six demolition projects a year and grow the business from there. While ship demolitions are a new area for Delete, the company is specialised in managing unusual demolition projects of all sizes. Before a ship can be taken apart, it has to find its way to the drydock. This is where Finnish maritime logistics specialist   steps in. The company has handled demanding cargo projects in Europe for over 20 years and invested heavily in building an energy efficient fleet. “We are the beginning and the end for the demolition process,” explains  , managing director at Meriaura. “Our interest is in acquiring the ships to be demolished and getting them to the dry dock. Our partners will then remove any hazardous waste and take the ship apart while we take care of selling and transporting the steel waste.” A single ship weighs thousands of tonnes, and up to 90 per cent of this is recyclable material, such as steel, and this kind of transport is Meriaura’s speciality. The company has the capacity to carry up to three million tonnes of cargo annually.  specialises in demanding demolition projects and environmental services. This is exactly the expertise the company, which employs 800 people in Finland and Sweden, hopes to bring to the Ship Recycling project. “Most of the actual demolition work would be our responsibility,” says  , business manager of Heavy Demolition Services at Delete. “In particular we bring expertise in hazardous materials, but also in taking apart the insides and the hull of a ship.” While ship demolitions are a new area for Delete, the company is specialised in managing unusual demolition projects of all sizes and welcomes the challenge of a ship’s narrow corridors and engine rooms. Delete believes ship demolitions could become a significant part of its services and argues Finland has all the elements required to become a major player in this industry: “Finland has environmentally friendly processes and ensures worker safety,” Salonen states. “Also, we have the consortium behind this and a large dry dock [suitable for big demolitions projects], which most European countries do not have.” The pieces are therefore all in place for Finland, now it is time for the country to show they can be put together. Turku Repair Yard is one of Northern Europe’s leading ship repair facilities."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/zombie-catchers/,Success catches up with Two Men and a Dog,"For this Helsinki-based games studio, tapping in to the zombie zeitgeist has come with a comic twist. Thanks to the likes of  , these days shuffling hordes of the undead are trampling all over our collective consciousness. Yet, in contrast to this typically sombre take on the zombie myth, Finnish mobile game   is more intent on tickling funny bones than tearing flesh from them. “We wanted to make the topic more cartoony; it’s more funny than disgusting,” states  , CEO of  , the studio behind the game. “We played around with the idea that what if the zombies were afraid of you and you would hunt them down. It’s more of a   type of universe, not a bloody one.” Even so, it’s fair to say that the game’s synopsis isn’t for the squeamish: Two intergalactic businessman protagonists set about enticing zombies from underground, spearing them with a harpoon and eventually placing their catch into a giant ‘squeezer’. Once condensed into liquid form, this substance is eagerly served up to the thirsty public. Yum! Back in the real world, gamers have similarly been drawn to what Two Men and a Dog has cooked up, with   racking up some 18 million downloads altogether thus far. The studio’s fresh approach to the undead has also seen the game accruing 1.7 million euros in gross revenue last year. “The key factor is we want people to remember the name.” Another layer of impressive to this tale is the fact that this is the studio’s first effort. “Our motto is to create games that no one has ever imagined,” Kallonen says. “Games very rarely do something different and are also fun, addictive and enjoyable to play. That’s a hard place to aim, and is definitely what we want to do.” It seems that there is plenty more where this came from for the four-person studio. “We are now finishing the game design for the sequel,” Kallonen states. “We have also started up another team lead by  , the creator of  . The new team is working on a game set in the same universe – a spin-off.” Not to be outdone, an animation series featuring the two main characters is also in the works. “It’s a classic combination,” Kallonen admits. “One character is a little bit more quick on their feet, impulsive. The other one is more thoughtful, keeps things on the right track. This creates a lot of good humour.” And so, with the immediate path ahead seemingly mapped out, the only thing left to contemplate for Two Men and a Dog is the means with which they will successfully achieve their ambitions. “Right now we are weighing up the option whether we should raise a funding round while we are scaling up,” Kallonen says. “We also have the option to just fund it by ourselves with our profits.” Needless to say, inevitably this is a dilemma that not many young companies find themselves in. Just another feather in the cap for Two Men and a Dog’s fresh approach, it seems. Hang on, speaking of different: What’s up with the company name then? “The first thing people see when they open the game is that it has been made by Two Men and A Dog,” Kallonen explains. “People immediately get a sense of it being playful, and it’s not going to be some super serious strategy game. “The key factor is we want people to remember the name.”"

Located on the outskirts of Kampala, Sun Spot has built Uganda’s first-ever facility for the assembly of solar energy systems. Consisting of a warehouse and assembly plant, here Chinese components help create ready-made kits that can power anything from water heaters to perimeter fence lamps. “We want to reach people in rural areas, so they can have access to energy,” the company’s  . These solar energy specialists opened a solar panel plant under the name SaloSolar in the south-west city of Salo in 2015. In addition to exporting solar panels and solar panel plants, the plant manufactures collectors for solar heating. “Our focus is not on mass production, but rather on producing tailored products and on product development,”   SaloSolar’s CEO,  . “We want to offer designers, product developers and, for instance, universities the opportunity to test the functionality of their designs in practice.” One of the  , this firm has created a product which ways over 90 per cent less than its predecessors. “I have dreamed of building materials that would themselves generate electricity, from roofs, windows and walls,” CEO    . “Now that’s becoming a reality.” This solar energy provider has made impressive inroads on the Danish solar market in recent years. “Our unique technology means minimised heat loss and maximised energy yield, and the results are best seen in practice,” the company’s managing director    . “The more data we receive from actual use of our collectors, the better we can encourage our potential new customers to rely on our thermal systems.” Hybrid power plants combining solar and other sources are the name of the game for this Finnish company, which has been making considerable waves recently in renewable energy. “We have been   for a few years now and understood early on that the opportunity for Nocart in Africa is huge,”   Nocart CEO  . “Now we begin to collect the first fruits of our work but we know that there are many possibilities to continue growth over the coming years in this market.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/swipe-right-with-momzie-to-find-a-new-mum-friend/,Swipe right with Momzie to find a new mum friend,"This Finnish mobile app does not offer the keys for finding true love, but rather a new kind of potential soul mate: a mum friend.  Whether it is basking in the wonders of a newborn or enduring the demands of the ‘terrible twos’, fellow mums can be invaluable in lending an understanding ear and keeping company at the playground. Now, finding a mum friend is just a few swipes away. The   mobile app helps to connect mums and mums-to-be with their peers living nearby. “I have a lot friends with small kids, but I cannot really offer them peer support or tips [since I do not have kids],” says Momzie CEO  , explaining how she got the idea for the app. “I have seen how important it is for them to have friends who are in a similar situation. You are lucky if you have mum friends in your own circles, but if you do not, they can be hard to find. Or they were until now.” So, how does the app work? The easy comparison is to matchmaking service Tinder, but without the cheesy chat up lines and disposable  . Instead, users flick through profiles of other mums in their area and swipe right if someone feels like friendship material. If both do the same, the two can start chatting in the app and eventually meet up in the real world. Momzie’s revenue model is based on companies using the app to offer benefits on products and services relevant to mums. Momzie’s approach has already created some passionate fans. The app’s launch in Finland in May last year set mum networks buzzing and today it has thousands of users across the country. Now the startup hopes to recreate the same success in the UK, where Momzie launched in early February. This represents a big leap from autumn 2015, when Lilja first got the idea. Although Lilja’s background is in the tech industry, the world of mobile app development was completely new to her. “I basically started by Googling ‘what do I need to do if I want to build an app?’,” she recalls. But relying on Google did not last long. Lilja found like-minded partners in two of her university friends and a few months later, in October 2015, Momzie the company was born. The team has shown tremendous determination ever since.  , head of technology, even put the finishing touches to the app the night before launch while at the maternity ward. A considerable feat considering his wife was in the process of going into labour. “She later sent me her regards that it was a good thing he was not hassling me, but instead had something sensible to do,” Lilja says with a laugh. Momzie’s current focus is on introducing new features and building its presence in the UK, but it is also eyeing new markets. The startup already has funding from  , the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, but to support these expansion plans Momzie aims to launch its first funding round later this spring. While a few services with similar ideas exist, Lilja notes that the other thing they all have in common is that they are all early stage companies. Thus she is confident that Momzie’s model stands out. “We strongly believe in our approach,” Lilja explains. “You can only make the first move after both parties have indicated they would like to get to know each other. This also means you can use the service without worrying about uncomfortable invites you do not know how to decline.” But the biggest factor is the user feedback Momzie receives. This ensures that the company is on the right path to bringing mum’s together. “Our users sometimes send us stories of the friendships they have formed through our app,” Lilja says. “These make my day. What we want is to offer is a service that really helps people.” “We have received a lot of help from mums themselves, they have spread the app in their own social media groups and networks,” Hanna Lilja says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/world-drinks-teerenpeli-s-success/,The world drinks to Teerenpeli’s health,"Microbreweries and small distilleries have stepped up their game in recent years, and so has their popularity. Teerenpeli is a familiar name for Finns, and now many more abroad are becoming acquainted with their variety of tipples. Back in the day,  ‘s life was at sea. Sailing the oceans as a member of a ship’s crew, docking at various ports of the world, he discovered and tasted a range of beers he hadn’t known existed. “In Finland at the time, beer mainly meant lager, and everything tasted quite samey,” he reminiscences. “It felt fair to wonder why there weren’t other options available in Finland, when elsewhere the selection was so abundant.” The reason boiled down to the country’s alcohol policy before entering the European Union. Due to price regulations, breweries had to be effective and be able to purchase ingredients cost-effectively, which meant that only a few big players were successful in entering the market. Now, the world is very different. Both goods and people flow much more freely across borders, and microbreweries and small distilleries, including  , are trending globally. It wasn’t immediately after Pyysing docked back in Finland that he got into the brewing and distilling business. Beverages remained a part of his life, though; in the mid-1990s, he founded a Teerenpeli restaurant in his hometown, Lahti. A year later, the first Teerenpeli beers were brewed. In 2002, the company family added another new member in Teerenpeli Distillery, which started with whisky and recently expanded to gin. Teerenpeli Distillery has recently started producing its own gin. The restaurant has also spread its wings. Now there are Teerenpeli restaurants in several cities in Finland, all of which serve a wide range of Teerenpeli’s own products. Finland isn’t the only place fond of the Teerenpeli taste. Over the course of 2016, the company doubled its volume of whisky exports. The challenge with whisky lies in the time its maturation takes. Trends and fashion fads come and go, so planning production can be tricky. However, Teerenpeli has made a strategic choice in deciding to boost its production. “We knowingly aim for the international market,” Pyysing explains. “The interest in microbreweries has been growing for a while now, and the same is happening with micro distilleries, so we’re confident there’s room for us in the market.” The first batches of gin were bottled a few months ago, and they’ll start travelling to different corners of the world this spring. Currently, the biggest market is in neighbouring Sweden, but Germany and the UK are also getting their fair share of Teerenpeli beverages. Pyysing says that Teerenpeli is constantly communicating with potential partners abroad. He won’t name any upcoming countries yet, but so far it’s looking promising. “People in Europe and Western countries in general are starting to appreciate small companies as they understand that there are alternatives to big corporations,” Pyysing notes. “In that sense, the timing is just right.” Teerenpeli was founded by a team of three, with Pyysing at the head. These days, it employs about 80 people. Now, in order to continue its international growth, the company is tapping various markets and finding out where to establish its own agents. Teerenpeli has also been involved in Finpro’s   programme. Pyysing deems Finnish beverages a field of export that isn’t fully appreciated yet, but is one that boasts an abundance of business opportunities. “It’s a well-known fact that the quality of water in Finland is exceptional in comparison to pretty much anywhere abroad, and its significance is only growing,” he points out. “Being able to process that water to highly refined products should be one of our main focuses.” Finland can consider itself lucky; not everyone can ‘turn water into wine’, and not everyone has the clean water to do so. CEO Anssi Pyysing    is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Finpro."

Of course, the flip side of the coin sees it wilting in the heat of competition or struggling to take root at all. For   CEO  , the belief in the company’s idea was clear was it was founded in 2009: electrification could be done better. “Up until then competitors making electric motors for ships, buses and machinery were adapting standard industrial technology to create new motors,” Rauma recalls. “We knew this approach was obsolete and didn’t serve the customer.” The team at Visedo instead created their electric drivetrains from scratch, building the smallest, lightest, toughest and most efficient power transmitter. Needless to say, they found themselves upon fertile ground indeed. New software completed their offering, and the company soon found its solution much in demand, growing over 500 per cent in three years. Further adding to the growth spurt, late last year Visedo   in financing to continue their expansion. Visedo manufactures high performance powertrain systems. Visedo has made an impact by focusing on powerful hybrid and electric systems, such as for the maritime, public transport and heavy machinery industries. These power systems need to operate efficiently and reliably in tough conditions. The company holds a number of records in this sector, such as powering the first fully electric bus in Helsinki. Elsewhere, in the maritime industry, it signed a deal to power the world’s first electric hybrid trimaran and the  . “We have seen the strongest market growth in Asia,” Rauma continues. “We will be announcing the opening of our new office in Hong Kong very soon.” Currently, the company operates in Finland with a subsidiary in the Netherlands and has clients in 19 different countries. Rauma says that they will eventually expand around the world but at present are focused on leading the European and Asian markets. Whilst Visedo inevitably means business when it comes to electric-powered vehicles, the company still has time to have fun also. Case in point, the company hit the headlines in 2012 for powering one of the fastest electric vehicles in the world on a frozen Finnish lake. This wasn’t for any monetary gain, rather the company simply wanted to give it a try. One thing the company is taking most seriously, however, is its target market. “We are not focused on personal transport applications,” Rauma says. “Together, heavy machinery, public transport and maritime represent a very significant addressable market. We want to remain highly focused on these applications where we have deep expertise and where we can make the most impact in tackling pollution and driving efficiency.” The company has made tremendous progress in a short period of time, but they have big plans for the future. “Simply put, our mission is to end pollution through electrification,” Rauma says. “The shift towards electrification of the world’s transport is already underway. We are at a point in history much like when petrol replaced the horse and cart, but now electricity is replacing diesel.” Rauma emphasises that the electrification revolution is a once in a lifetime occurrence. “It represents a huge opportunity on the one hand but also serious problems if we don’t act fast enough,” he states. “We have to get this right and Visedo is leading this monumental shift in the way the world’s transport is powered.”"

These have spawned the healthtech breakthroughs of tomorrow that were introduced in Helsinki this week. A throng of promising health tech entrepreneurs from all over Europe gathered at the   event on 15-16 March, organised by  ‘s   programme. And so, this Friday, we have the pleasure of presenting five Finnish future creators from the subsector: medical devices & diagnostics. With great demand comes a great solution. As half a billion people worldwide now have diabetes, Optomed can help detecting and preventing disease outbreaks at an early stage via its cost-effective screening method. “Our key product is Smartscope PRO, a modular hand-held retinal camera for screening and diagnosis of various eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and AMD,” says company founder and CEO  . Artificial Intelligence is taking enormous steps forward in 2017. The company is a trailblazer in the clinical decision support scene, and while it is focusing on neurological disorders, its method is universal. “Our solution is a cloud-based tool for the comprehensive analysis of patient data,” CEO   explained  . “We are not replacing doctors, but rather offer them intelligent tools to support accurate early diagnosis.” This name changer is a game changer. The company previously known as Brainshake provides blood analysis service that takes 230 biomarkers from a single blood sample. “We have been working in the science world by co-operating with universities, including the big ones like Oxford and Cambridge,” tells a partner of Nightingale health,  . “Now we are coming out of the closet and aiming to the clinical market.” “The disruptive power of our technology relies in extensive scientific background and scalability allowing the blood analysis to be used in routine healthcare,” he said  . It’s not only your doctor who cares, but also this company, whose product, Kaiku, means ‘echo’ in Finnish. “Kaiku has been created to break down the barriers of communication between cancer patients and their doctors,”  , Netmedi’s head of operations,  . “The online platform guides a cancer patient through treatment and recovery.” “Producing the pills is no longer enough for pharmaceutics,” says  , CEO and co-founder. “Tumors are becoming more common, but various forms of therapy have made treatments more efficient.” This nanotech startup manufactures thin film sensor modules, whose main markets are the fast-growing wearable personal fitness and medical devices. “Thin film sensor modules may collect lot of information,” says CEO  . “It is able to monitor actual blood pressure. In addition, the sensor can measure how the heart is performing, and together with contact lenses eye-pressure can be measured as well. All alarming info will be sent to the mobile.”    is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Finpro."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mightifier-doesn-t-kid-around-with-promoting-goodwill-at-school/,Mightifier doesn’t kid around with promoting goodwill at school,"This Finnish tablet application boosts kindness and understanding in the classroom by letting school children give positive feedback to one another. Even before the advent of social media, life as a youngster was already a difficult enough proposition. Whether it was finding one’s place amidst the various cliques in the schoolyard, battling assorted growing pains or juggling difficulties at home, the path to happiness as an adolescent has always been littered with numerous potholes. Nowadays, with digital devices within everyone’s reach, the journey is even more perilous. Seemingly every aspect of kids’ lives can be thrust into the public eye, open for scrutiny and, worse still, anonymous criticism. Thankfully,  , is quite literally on hand to help. Through the Mightifier tablet app, children give one another feedback on their positive qualities and personality traits. Each child is assigned another student in the class to whom they are asked to give positive feedback. Students then choose a positive character trait and write an explanation why they think the person merits it. Sounds simple, but the effects are rapid and concrete: “Teachers tell us that after 10 weeks of using Mightifier, they’ve seen that there is less restlessness and arguing in the classroom,” says company CEO  . “As the atmosphere is calmer, the students are also more active with their schoolwork.” Moreover, teachers are able to keep an eye on the big picture through a specific dashboard, giving them insight into the general trends in the classroom. The inspiration that lead to Mightifier had a perhaps slightly surprising origin: brand building. Pänkäläinen, who previously helped build companies and products, says that when a brand is developed, the process typically starts with asking what is unique and special about it. “It’s wonderful to see how children react to the positive feedback they receive,” says Pänkäläinen (second from left). “With people, we tend to have it backwards – we focus on problems and what is wrong with others, rather than highlighting why they are unique and precious just as they are.” Developing the idea, Pänkäläinen quickly realised that children especially would benefit from getting encouraging feedback from their peers. The first version of Mightifier was tested last spring with 250 schoolchildren. The same year the company also took part in two different accelerators, which opened new doors especially abroad. Currently Mightifier has thousands of users, and is running pilot projects at schools in Chicago, Silicon Valley and Hong Kong. Naturally, being used across the globe, cultural differences come into play: “In the US, complimenting others is not so much of a challenge as in Finland, but Mightifier still helps children better understand how their behaviour affects other people,” says Pänkäläinen. “In Asia, school children are typically under very high pressure to perform well. In that context, we are very happy if we can reduce stress and help children feel that they are precious just as they are.” According to Pänkäläinen, there is interest to expand Mightifier beyond the initial pilots in both Asia and the US, and the company is already in talks with private school chains, as well as other partners that would help the app become available to as many children as possible. In addition to focusing on marketing the app abroad in the near future, the firm is also discussing with educational authorities in several Finnish towns about launching additional pilots around the country already this spring. “It’s wonderful to see how children react to the positive feedback they receive, and it’s crucial for them to learn to recognise their own qualities,” Pänkäläinen says. “Lately we’ve heard a lot about young people, especially men, who have become marginalised from society. I would bet that those young men don’t know what their strengths are.” Not for long, if Mightifier has anything to say about it. The innovation is set to have a major impact on classrooms, both for school children and their teachers."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/leonidas-cutting-edge-plans-become-a-reality/,Leonidas’ cutting-edge plans become a reality,"Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to turn learning, gaming or even mundane tasks into a truly immersive experience. For Finnish software specialist Leonidas, it is also an opportunity to be at the forefront of a new technology. Imagine donning a pair of VR goggles and suddenly finding yourself submerged in a completely new environment. You could be diving deep in the ocean, experiencing the adrenaline rush of skydiving or learning how, for example, to operate complex machinery. Tampere-based   believes these immersive experiences have the power to transform education, training and entertainment, and is thus putting its money where its mouth is. One million euros’ worth, to be exact. The company’s seven-figure investment in the development of new VR products is also being complimented by the hiring of 20 new employees. “VR and AR [augmented reality] are estimated to be a 120 billion-US dollar market by 2020,” explains  , Leonidas’ co-founder. “It is a huge market, but we are also personally very interested in VR technology. Our goal is to find areas in this sector where we can create new business, products and services that enable international growth.” Along with an expanded budget and more personnel, Leonidas VR pursuits are also supported by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, as part of its research project on enhanced VR and 360-degree video analysis. Leonidas is among the first companies in the world to apply this technology to education. Developed for traffic safety agency   in cooperation with  , the company’s first VR application combines 360-degree video and gamification to teach nine- to 12-year-olds traffic rules. Once the VR goggles have been donned, the youngsters ‘learn by doing’ as they seemingly bike about in a real city. “The response from kids has been they much prefer this to studying from a book,” Lammi says, with no small understatement. “The experience combines a real environment with guidance. The kids can safely try out different scenarios and receive instant feedback.” Leonidas was started in 2008 by seven friends to introduce agile methods to software development. In the nine years since the company has grown from its CEO’s living room to an 18-employee operation specialised in web and mobile solutions. VR was introduced to this mix last year, but for Leonidas’ founders the technology has been a passion for considerably longer. Two years ago, Lammi and  , Leonidas CEO, founded  , a non-profit organisation that seeks to drive its development in Finland. Now is the time to explore these technologies and trial new things. The duo is convinced VR is a major opportunity for the Nordic country. All the necessary pieces are already in place: strong hardware skills, successful gaming companies, world-renowned education expertise and mobile prowess cultivated by Nokia’s heritage. And it is not only Finns who see this as an attractive combination. Magic Leap, the Florida-based AR startup backed by 1.4 billion US dollars in funding,   last year. “VR requires taking into account many different things,” Lammi explains. “There is the technology, but you also need to understand storytelling and soundscapes. In Finland we have a lot of experience in all of this.” Leonidas sees VR as a gateway to global markets, but instead of a detailed internationalisation plan the company wants its products to speak for themselves. A big moment will be next autumn, as Lammi teases that Leonidas is set to launch a VR product guaranteed to raise interest far beyond Finnish borders. While this is all he will reveal right now, Lammi emphasises the time is ripe for companies to invest in VR and AR. “When I was a teenager I saw how the Internet developed,” he enthuses. “This is a similar moment where we have a new platform still looking to take its shape. Now is the time to explore these technologies and trial new things. “When they start on a huge growth curve and you already have the experience, contacts and assets, it is easy to be at the forefront of the competition.” : “One amazing example of VR is in surgeon training,” Lammi enthuses. “There are a limited number of bodies for training use, but with a VR application surgeons can practice as much as they like and get instant feedback if something goes wrong.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gugguu-wants-perfect-fit/,Gugguu wants the perfect fit,"If the shops don’t sell what you’d want to buy, it might be a good idea to try and do it yourself. Case in point: the two sisters behind the kids clothing brand Gugguu managed to create a whole community based on their distinctive design and sustainable production.  and  , two sisters with six children altogether, were never happy with the clothes they bought for their kids. If the design was nice, the sleeves were too short; if the size was spot-on, the material was anything but top-notch. Good quality, correct sizing and nice cuts and prints never seemed to meet. Riekki lost patience. If no one else was doing things right, she decided she would. With no prior experience in the field but an enthusiastic friend onboard, Riekki founded a company and began uncovering the secrets of kids’ fashion. Now   is one of the children’s clothing brands that people queue up to buy from both shops and online. The initial co-founder has since stepped aside from daily operations, and Valli took the spot of running the company together with her sister. The name Gugguu sounds like the word  , the Finnish equivalent of ‘peek-a-boo’. This word emerged at the last possible moment, just when the sisters had already sent the first labels to print – but with a name that didn’t feel quite right. “I was cooking at home and Miia rang me,” Valli recalls. “She said we have to come up with something and quickly, because once the printing machines are on, there’s nothing we can do about it.” Just then, Valli’s youngest child peeked into the kitchen from around the corner and greeted his mum with a cheerful “ ”. The call being on loudspeaker, Riekki thus heard one of the one-year-old’s first words. “Miia instantly recognised that ‘this is it’. We had found what we had been seeking for so long!” Gugguu goes the extra mile to make its clothes worth the fuss. All materials come from Europe, and long-term partners in Finland and Estonia take care of the manufacturing. The sizing is carefully thought through, and there’s a no-exceptions rule when it comes to double-sizes – which means a piece of clothing that can be made bigger or smaller with buttons, zippers or the like. Gugguu goes the extra mile to make its clothes worth the fuss. “Many manufacturers use double-sizing, but the clothes don’t tend to fit either size right,” Valli explains. Children wearing Gugguu don’t need to look like they’ve been dressed in a cape. Gugguu clothes are a little narrower than usual, which makes them fit better and look nicer. Well-fitting clothes mean that as the child grows (and boy do they, so quickly!), the shirt will evidently be too small for the not-so-little-one-anymore. As Gugguu’s clothes cost more than the average high-street brands, the investment might feel a bit too precious. Gugguu’s solution to this is simple: the clothes are of such high quality and appealing design that they can be used by younger siblings or sold forward once the first user has had their fun with them – for almost or even exactly the same price as new ones. Gugguu’s goal goes further than clothes: Valli points out that they’ve also wanted to create a community of families. Customers can bring their children to photo shoots, visit Gugguu’s popup events, meet people and collect new experiences. On social media, Gugguu has really taken off: on top of its official fan page (just under 50 000 likes), there are groups for second-hand Gugguu sales and discussions, the biggest of which has over 15 000 members. The creator behind each Gugguu product is Riekki, with the help of professional seamstresses. Initially Gugguu wanted to focus on small sizes, but due to popular demand, Gugguu pieces can be worn by up to 12-year-old children as well as adults, too. “Clothes for grown-ups has really been a sidetrack, as it wasn’t our original intention,” Valli says. “We want to only sell clothes we’d buy or wear ourselves. Sometimes we get requests to make adult sizes of a particular children’s product, but unless we really believe it’s a good idea, we won’t do it.” Gugguu employs around 10 people, including its owners and part-time staff members. It runs operations from a warehouse in Tampere, Finland, and has resellers in Europe, North America and Asia. At the moment, the biggest foreign fan crowd can be found in China. In general, international sales are up; according to Valli, Gugguu’s own webstore receives orders from abroad in growing numbers. Valli believes there to be plenty more potential markets to be tapped. Countries with Finland-style weather are especially keen to get their hands on Gugguu products. “It’s all just a beginning for us now,” Valli says. “Although we’ve worked long and hard on our internationalisation, it takes time and patience. Fortunately, things are looking promising.” Gugguu’s goal goes further than clothes: they’ve also wanted to create a community of families."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-eco-friendly-research/,Five for Friday: Eco-friendly research,"Jaw-dropping innovations from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland are seemingly a dime a dozen these days. Here are some of its more memorable ecologically-sound announcements from recent times. Offering an alternative to large solar panels on rooftops and building walls, solar energy can be now harvested from one’s work desk to power mobile phones and LED light bulbs. “The tree trunk is made with 3D technology by exploiting wood-based biomaterials VTT has developed,”  . “The energy itself is transferred through leaves that have thin solar panels at the surface, invented by the VTT’s own printing method.” ’s new method, known as ‘CatLignin,’ produces reactive lignin material that can replace toxic components found in adhesives widely used in engineered wood products, while also making the pulp industry more bio-friendly. “The suitability of lignin for a variety of applications has been investigated for decades, but only now we have found a way to use it as a phenol substitute in significant quantities in resins,” senior scientist at VTT,   last month. “VTT’s CatLignin technology represents a technological leap, offering new business opportunities to many industrial players.” Seeking some extra protein in your diet, without a side order of guilt associated with the meat industry? Fear not, VTT has harnessed the structure and flavour of mealworms and crickets to develop foods such as meatballs and falafel. The research centre has developed a dry fractionation method that can easily produce insect fractions with varying flavours and degrees of coarseness. “VTT tested the fractions as a raw material for meatballs and falafel balls by replacing between five and 18 per cent of meatball or falafel content with insect fractions,”  . “Given that insects are rich in high-quality protein, even such a small addition of the insect fractions tripled the protein content of falafel balls. VTT is exploring the properties of autumn leaves for use in the cosmetics, textile and feed and food industries. The range of interesting substances can have various health-promoting effects, as well as be used as nutraceuticals and to colour cosmetics and textiles. “In laboratory experiments, we discovered several, promising alternative ways of utilising leaves,” stated VTT senior scientist   . “Piloting assays are under way, in which we are examining how our methods work in practice and what quantities of valuable compounds can be extracted from the leaves.” VTT, along with   are participating in an EU project that is recycling and developing high-performance fibres.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/uros-makes-global-connection-for-travellers-and-iot/,UROS makes global connection for travellers and IoT,"The fastest growing company in Finland has made a name for itself with smartphones and mobile hotspots. Now UROS is targeting the Internet of Things. Picture this: you’re having the time of your life on holiday in Rome. You would like to send your friends back home a selfie of you in front of the Colosseum, but are afraid of an outrageous bill from your service provider waiting for you upon your return home. Clueless about how much roaming and data charges will cost, you go on your way, sad not to be able to share this experience. Well, shed not a further tear. Finnish telecom services company   has the perfect solution. The company was founded in 2011 and immediately set out to specialise in mobile international connectivity. Its first innovation on the market was Goodspeed Mobile Hotspot, a device which enables travellers to have high-speed and secure connections at a much lower cost than traditional roaming. The company’s development has only continued to gather momentum since then. In fact, UROS has swiftly become the fastest-growing company in Finland, with a compound annual growth rate of over 640 per cent between 2014 and 2016. “In addition to growing revenue, in 2016 we expanded the product line to Smartphone Roaming Apps and IoT as well,” says  , president at UROS. “At the Mobile World Congress we announced our latest roaming smartphone V8Lite ZTE product with embedded Goodspeed roaming app.” The   will see UROS’ roaming app on ZTE’s newer Blade smartphones. The deal is no one-off in the region, with Asia playing a central role in the company’s expansion. UROS also has a deal with China Telecom Global and offices in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Additionally, it has inked agreements with more than 60 operators worldwide. “We are also seeing strong interest and demand from the African continent,” Raatikainen continues. “The high and sometimes complex roaming charges within the region can prohibit corporate travellers from using data services while travelling. In addition, we will focus on the Middle East, Caribbean and the Americas.” Altogether, UROS’ solutions now cover over 120 countries. Whereas the Goodspeed Roaming App was designed for the traveller who wants to keep things simple and pay as needed, the company also offers Goodspeed for Business, which provides administration tools in addition to connectivity. And it doesn’t stop there. Yet another of the company’s solutions is the result of a partnership  , which offers a local subscription to a mobile device. Jacky Zhang, senior vice president of ZTE Corporation and CEO of EMEA and APAC for ZTE Mobile Devices and Jyrki Hallikainen, founder and chairman of the board of UROS Group at the launch of the ZTE Blade V8 Lite embedded with Goodspeed Roaming at MWC2017. Thus, Goodspeed devices, smartphones with the app and other devices can automatically select a local mobile operator as users travel across borders while using a single SIM card. This service is based upon the embedded SIM standard. Not to be outdone, the Oulu-based company has also expanded into the Internet of Things. UROS is working with Pisara, a water management platform from  , to provide smart management solutions for national water operation systems. Water quality can be maintained via AI and smart sensors, while equipment can be monitored for preventive maintenance. “The benefits of our IoT solution are operational reliability, real-time monitoring and cost efficiency,” says Raatikainen. “We think demand from this industry will only grow bigger.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/musicinfo-heads-downstream-china/,Musicinfo heads downstream in China,"Hoping to crack the mainland Chinese market with your musical output? This Finnish distribution service is here to give creative types the inside track. The year 2000 was notable for many things: Sydney hosted the Olympics in Australia, mad cow disease was still rearing its head in Europe and the globe as a whole got off to a bumpy start, after the much-touted millennial meltdown failed to materialise. Over in the music world, the industry was undergoing something of its own millennial shuffle. After providing a virtual free-for-all of online illegal musical exchange for several years, Napster was eventually taken to court by heavy metal icons Metallica. Whilst the peer-to-peer file sharing service was eventually forced to shutter its freemium business model, what was evidently clear was that music fans sought a fresh approach, an easier way for them to access the tunes they love. Fast-forward 17 years and the current abundance of streaming services offers an embarrassment of riches for listeners. Nonetheless, amidst this ease of access, distribution itself remains music only to the ears of record company execs. “Globally, music companies still dominate the music business,” explains   CEO    . “One per cent dominates around 80 per cent of the industry.” And this is just Western markets. There are even bigger hurdles to overcome if one wants to reach other listeners with their carefully crafted tunes. Take the Chinese market, for example. The largest audience in the world, China currently has 530 million music streamers. But there are strict limitations on how they can be accessed. Musicinfo initially started out by gathering all music- and musician-related information under one metadata roof. “We created the Google of music,” Halttunen recalls. “China is complicated for international companies and services,” Halttunen continues. “Chinese law says that if you provide music there, you have to have a company in China and have to have all servers there.” Thus, to facilitate such access, Musicinfo has partnered up with a Chinese company to create a distribution service for independent musicians and record labels. For a one-time fee of 99 euros, users can upload an unlimited amount of music, sit back and commence accruing royalties from China. Simple as that. One sticking point in the development of streaming services thus far has been how artists are seemingly short changed by record companies, with meagre returns on their blood, sweat and tears. Musicinfo seeks to change this. And then some: a total of 85 per cent of revenues are passed on to the artists. Given the rapid growth of the Chinese market, this represents a significant slice of a potentially very significant pie. “In 2015, Chinese digital music sales increased about 70 per cent,” Halttunen points out. “We are building a bridge between Asia and the Western countries.” Many are seizing the opportunity to expand their audible reach to the Far East. Since starting in November last year, hundreds of artists from over 10 countries have joined the service. This rapid growth is reflected in the expansion of company personnel. “Currently we have 16 employees working in seven different countries,” Halttunen says. “We have an international team, with many native language speakers. That’s the reason why we have quickly acquired our clients from so many different countries.” Looking ahead it’s not just the Chinese market that Musicinfo is hoping to tap. Halttunen has just returned from a trip to Pakistan, where its population of 200 million also enjoys its own streaming services. The neighbouring Indian market beckons also. What unites these countries is that they have something that many music markets share. “Some 80 per cent of each market is made up of local music that people want to listen to,” Halttunen states. “The other 20 per cent is international music. Young people want to listen to different music more and more.” It seems that the volume of Musicinfo’s offering will soon be heard in greater numbers, indeed. Musicinfo was a popular presence at Slush Shanghai last year. It takes seven business days for music to get distributed in China via the service."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-finnish-beer-innovations/,Five for Friday: Finnish beer innovations,"There was a time when the mere mention of Finnish beer would be met with a derisive shrug. Those days are many pints ago. After recently getting to know  , you may be starting to ponder: What else is going on in the world of suds here in this northern land? Quite a bit, let it be known. This Tampere-based brewery racked up a gold medal at the World Beer Awards for its Black IPA last autumn, with its offering soon set to be enjoyed in the US under the name Baltic Black IPA. Not to be outdone, it was also awarded at the World Beer Idol contest in the Czech Republic earlier this year. “The fact that this recognition comes mainly from a Czech jury, which is able to evaluate really precise nuances of the beers, makes this award especially great,” head brewer   said of the accolade  . Whilst the same few yeast strains have been used in the production of lager beer for centuries, different nuances of flavour in ale, whisky, wine and cider are achieved by a wide range of yeast strains. Cue VTT’s discovery of hybrid lager yeasts, which impart new flavour and accelerate the beer’s production process. “The resultant new yeasts have inherited characteristics from their parents strains, including accelerating the wort fermentation process and improving ethanol production,”  . “They are also more tolerant of cold than one of their parent strains, and settle better after fermentation than their predecessors.” After being enjoyed in its homeland since 2001, Finnish gluten-free Kukko beer is  . Produced by local wind-powered brewery Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas, currently four different gluten-free beers are on the market, thanks to  . “There are now some gluten-free beers out there but none of them are as good from a taste perspective as Kukko,” the company’s  . “[…] Our intention is not to advertise it as a gluten-free beer, but as a great-tasting beer that happens to be gluten-free.” This company is taking Nordic malts to the world of beer. Commencing production of American malts last year, these vikings teamed up with Colorado Malting Company to wet the whistle of European beer lovers. “American-style beers are getting more and more popular,”  , business unit manager of Viking Malt. “This collaboration gives us a chance to offer also American craft malts all throughout Europe. We have seen growing interest for these kinds of products for a while now, so we are very pleased with this collaboration and see it as a great opportunity.” What would a list of Finnish achievements be without the mention of an app? Similarly unsurprising is that the idea for this innovation first surfaced at the pub. And so, users can harness its technology to get the inside word on close-by pubs and beers. “The greatest differences between Pint Please and its competitors are its local nature and the strong linking together of pubs and users,” developer    . “Many other applications are directed at beer aficionados, but Pint Please is directed more towards the average consumer who also drinks specialty beers.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/villada-takes-doorsteps-luxury/,Villada takes you to the doorsteps of luxury,"Finnish Villada combines the services of a simple booking platform and a door-to-door travel agency for those searching for an opulent holiday home abroad. Imagine waking up in a king size bed with just one problem: do you go for a morning dip in the jacuzzi in the ensuite bathroom of your bedroom, the pool just next to the beautiful, sun-filled terrace outside or the Mediterranean a short trek from your front door? For those not on the cheapest of holidays, this might be an actual contemplation. Now, Finnish travel startup   is making decisions like this more and more common among regular holiday-goers. “We noticed that villas were only really available through global sites,” Villada CEO   explains. “There was no domestic option and no way to receive customer support in Finnish.” Villada’s idea is to tie together the simplicity of a booking site and the customer service and helpfulness of a travel agency. The service was launched in Finland in 2014. Lehtonen and co-founder   decided to focus on destinations that were within an easy reach from Finland and already popular in the market, such as the Greek Islands, Italy and Portugal. The villas are handpicked, and they have to tick a fair few boxes on the list of qualities to make the cut for Villada’s offering. Lehtonen isn’t willing to go into too much detail, but one of the demands is that the villa is available in its entirety; Villada doesn’t offer individual rooms or floors, only entire houses. Also, most properties have their own swimming pools. Villada aims to be the number one premium villa service in the Nordic market by 2020. At the end of last year, the company   from investors, and the sum was used to expand cross the pond to the  . Eerik Rusanen (left), Lois Edvardsson and Tommi Lehtonen are the people running Villada in Finland and Sweden. According to Lehtonen, Sweden has exceeded all expectations. After significantly less time in the market, the booking figures are on the same level as in Finland. During the course of this year, Villada will enter some of the remaining Nordic countries. “In general, we believe there’s plenty of potential in the Nordic market,” Lehtonen notes. At the moment, Villada offers around 600 villas in nine countries. The number is constantly on the increase; Lehtonen says that when in the beginning Villada was reaching out to the villas, now the villas are coming their way proactively. Lehtonen anticipates that the list will include at least a thousand options by the end of the year. The company has also proven safe for investors. It’s profitable as things stand, and investments go to growth and development. This keeps risks at a reasonable level. New destinations are constantly sought; the Villada duo is keen to hear where travellers want to head for their vacations. With its growing number of customers, the company is in a good place when it comes to finding villa owners. “In practice, whenever we suggest collaboration, we don’t tend to hear anyone say no,” Lehtonen tells. At the moment, Villada employs its two founding fathers plus one, who’s in charge of the Swedish operations. With the sales numbers skyrocketing, soon there’ll be room for customer service personnel and a developer. When new countries get on board, each market will have someone looking after customers locally. Being in the travel business comes naturally to the duo, as Lehtonen and Rusanen are seasoned travellers themselves. During their studies, they did an exchange in Barbados, interned in Russia and participated in courses in the UK together. Now, they both tend to spend their holidays in Villada villas. “But we no longer travel together,” Lehtonen says. “These days, we tend to take our holidays separately.” This villa is located in Bali, a popular holiday destination among Nordic travellers.   Text: Anne Salomäki"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mifuko-makes-case-fair-trade-baskets/,Mifuko makes a case for fair trade baskets,"Finnish Mifuko’s beautiful design baskets do exactly what it says on the, well, basket. In Swahili, ‘mifuko’ means ‘pocket’, and Mifuko ensures no one is left with empty pockets in the end. In 2008,   and   were exploring the markets of the Kenyan capital Nairobi. The two women, who had met each other whilst studying textile arts, were astonished by the handcraft skills of Kenyan women. However, a fair bit was lacking when it came to fresh design. “When we went to a local market, we saw many different people selling the same products,” Impiö explains. “If one came up with something new, the rest followed suit and copied it.” Impiö’s family was based in Nairobi at the time, and Martikainen lived in Finland. The duo decided that by combining Finnish design and Kenyan craft(wo)manship, new markets could be conquered. The tentative idea delivered. Now, six years since the very first order, the two-woman company   has a network of over 500 women producing traditional, Fair Trade certified kiondo baskets that are sent all over the world to design boutiques, lifestyle shops and department stores. Mifuko wants everyone to win. The women in Kenya have been able to bring in extra income on the side of unpredictable and weather-dependent farming. For some, Mifuko has turned into their most important job, and daughters of rural families have been able to return to their home villages from the big city slums because of the work provided by Mifuko. The women behind Mifuko: Minna Impiö and Mari Martikainen. The good doesn’t end there; because of the extra money, the women can buy products and services from others in their villages. This way, the whole community benefits. “It’s essential that our partnership is ongoing and continuous,” Martikainen emphasises. “In the beginning, we could tell that the women had seen a lot of projects come and go. It took them a while to believe what we weren’t going anywhere, but once they did, they’ve been really motivated and committed.” It’s not all charity, though. The end customer receives a handmade product that is unique and of high quality, regardless of what he or she makes of Mifuko’s social efforts. “The design has to be eye-catching – that’s where it all starts from,” Martikainen emphasises. “No one would stop and listen to our story if it wasn’t for the design that intrigues them.” Those who wish to contribute further than buying Mifuko products can do so through  , a foundation which Martikainen and Impiö established to improve the welfare of the communities sustainably. Martikainen and Impiö believe that consumers are increasingly aware of and interested in the origin of the products they purchase. Mifuko wants to do everything as transparently as possible: every item the company sells bears the name of its maker on the label. In Finland, the market for design items is limited, which means that heading outside of its borders is a lifeline for companies like Mifuko. The concept has proven functional: Mifuko has over 300 resellers in over 30 countries, including France’s renowned department store, Merci, and design boutiques in Japan. The vast majority, approximately 90 per cent, of production is shipped abroad. The biggest orders come from France, then Japan, followed by the US. New collaborators are popping up all the time, and at the moment, Switzerland and the US are looking particularly promising. If the baskets’ journey from a rural village or a city slum is a long one, it hasn’t been without ups and downs for the Mifuko founders either. Seeing that Mifuko can bring about a real, concrete change in the lives of the women and their families is a huge reward for the entrepreneurs. “It feels quite amazing to see the brand for sale in a Parisian store,” Impiö notes. “It’s been a lengthy road that’s taken a lot of courage. Fortunately, we’ve had each other – alone we would’ve given up!” Each Mifuko basket is unique and comes with a label signed by its maker.   Text: Anne Salomäki"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/fitwood-flexes-muscle-home-exercise/,FitWood flexes its muscles in home exercise,"There is little room for excuses to skip a workout if your training equipment is a stylish part of your home decor. Despite all our good intentions fitness equipment often ends up gathering dust in a closet instead of improving our muscle definition. For  , CEO and founder of  , the reason is simple: fitness products are often too unattractive to be kept out on display in our homes. And what is out of sight is out of mind. “If the equipment would be in plain view [and ready to use] all the time, it would support a more active lifestyle,” Kukkonen says. “We started to question why design thinking has not been applied to fitness equipment, when it is part of everything else in our homes.” FitWood’s solution? To combine trendy bodyweight training with sustainability, Scandinavian design and Nordic wood to create a new product category of ‘design home fitness equipment’. The wood for FitWood’s products come from certified forests. All the materials are free from harmful chemicals and the focus is on making products that please the eye, are easy to use and can last a lifetime. While this puts a premium on the price, Kukkonen believes there are plenty of consumers that share these values. FitWood is creating a new product category of design-focused home fitness products which combine functionality, sustainability and Scandinavian design language. A perfect example of FitWood’s design approach is its latest innovation, a coffee table that doubles as a training bench. It looks like a nice wooden table with a glass cover, but Kukkonen ensures you only need to move the glass away to use it for a whole-body workout complete with box jumps, steps up or bench presses. Parts of the table can even be used as weights. Kukkonen’s interest in our wellbeing stems from years of competing as a national level sprinter. Some 10 years ago he started his first foray into entrepreneurship with an online sports retail business, but a busy schedule left training at home as his only option. Now Kukkonen is pouring his business and sport experiences into developing new products for FitWood. “I had been thinking for some time that while my business was Finland-oriented, I would like to focus more on exports,” he explains. “Something that would also offer bigger opportunities for growth.” Meeting his current business partner  three years ago provided the final push Kukkonen needed. FitWood was started in the summer 2015 and its first products hit the shelves six months later in time for the Christmas season. Now the company has nine products in its catalogue, its first retail partners outside Finland and customers as far away as the US. Today FitWood’s products are more useful to Kukkonen than ever as he and his six-member team are busy building an international distribution network, continuing product development and creating brand awareness. Furthermore, the company just closed a successful round on Finnish equity crowdfunding platform Invesdor,  . But there have also been missteps on the way. In early 2017 FitWood decided to try its luck on popular US crowdfunding site Kickstarter, but the campaign failed to gain attention. For Kukkonen this was an important lesson on preparation: “The significance of your own contacts is much bigger in these campaigns than people understand. If you just launch a campaign without commitments from investors in advance, people will not find it.” His advice now is to do proper groundwork to get key people on board who can help get a campaign off to a flying start. This will then attract other supporters. Kukkonen also emphasises that crowdfunding is not suitable for all types of products. But for FitWood it proved to be the second time lucky and now the company is ready to add weight to its international push. When your ambition is to create a new product category, you want top spot on the podium."

A way of tapping into the market is Alipay, China’s largest online and mobile payment and lifestyle platform. , operated by Ant Financial Services Group, is a related company of Alibaba Group. It boasts over 450 million active users in China and beyond, and currently it is the most popular online payment tool in China. This week, Alipay, its Finnish partner   and   organised a workshop for over a 100 companies operating in Finland keen to hear about attracting the   coming to these shores.  spoke to five companies that attended the event. Flytour XD takes tourists (and why not locals, too) over the rooftops of Helsinki in a 4D cinema. Co-founder and PR and marketing manager   tells   that the company has been using Alipay for a couple of months. She took part in the workshop as she was keen to hear more about the opportunities Alipay can offer. “We want to know how we can gain visibility among Chinese tourists, as well as what kinds of things need to be taken into account due to cultural differences,” she explains.  from Scandic Hotels visited the event just before his workplace was about to start using Alipay. Some Finnish hotels from different hotel chains are beginning to test the service in the coming days. “Many Chinese people pop into Helsinki on their way to Lapland, and it’s evident that they are coming in growing numbers,” Syvähuoko says. “The Alipay system seems simple enough to use, and I’m here to hear how it would affect our daily work routines.” LUMI leather accessories brand is already using Alipay. Co-founder and designer   has noticed that LUMI products attract Chinese customers, who aren’t into big logos and labels. LUMI follows this aesthetic. Beaugrand has noticed a change in sales after Alipay’s arrival. “I don’t know if Alipay itself has triggered it, but it’s worked great.” Strömma Finland produces activities and entertainment for travellers, events and meetings. Sales point manager   says that the company doesn’t accept Alipay payments as of yet, but she’s intrigued by its features. “There’s plenty of potential as there are more and more Chinese people coming to Finland,” she says. “The payment method could be one of our selling points.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/perfect-cuppa-taste-north/,The perfect cuppa with the taste of the north,"If tea is your, well, cup of tea, you must know the struggle is real. Not all restaurants or even coffee shops know how to brew a good cuppa: green tea is often too bitter, black tea too strong and white tea simply unheard of. And poor quality bagged tea? You must be joking.  and   had had enough. Pretty much exactly three years ago, they met up at a mutual friend’s place for a weekday brunch and started ranting: How can it be that although humankind has enjoyed tea for centuries, you can still be served a mug full of borderline undrinkable fluid at a café or a restaurant? “It was a long, long lecture,” Rantala reminiscences laughingly. That summer, Rantala and Olin were brainstorming ideas for a startup. Initially, they wanted to start a consulting business to train coffee shops and restaurants about proper tea preparation – and how to forget about tea bags and go for loose leaf instead. Then another idea was thrown at the duo. Why consulting, when you’ve got what it takes to set up your very own tea brand? “At first, it felt like a huge chore, as our idea had been to import ready-made tea blends from abroad,” Rantala explains. “However, delving deeper into the matter, we noticed that no one really does what we were looking for, with the values and principles we had.” For example, many companies use aromas in their tea blends. The   ladies wanted zero additives, only natural and pure ingredients from Nordic nature. “Why bring goji berries to Finland and call them a superfood, when our very own blueberries are just as good, if not better?” Nord-T was born out of wanting to give Nordic nature a new form. The first year was spent on product development, branding, design and trips abroad with  ’s Food from Finland export programme. Internationalisation was involved from the word go, and the entrepreneurs didn’t want to set sail with lukewarm ideas. Polar Night Cap tea blend was created to resemble cinnamon rolls, a very Nordic treat. Then, it was time for tea. “When we touched our first Nord-T packages in June last year, we both burst into tears,” Rantala tells. “It was a result of so much hard work and effort. Finally we felt like the world was wide open in front of us!” Yet still, the duo didn’t start slacking. Instead, with a selection of black, green and white Nord-T teas in hand, they started searching for more distributors and resellers abroad. Now, Nord-T is available in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and the UK, and soon in Australia and Japan. The teas, all containing natural ingredients with an organic tea base, are handblended and named according to their character. All Nordic capitals have their own namesake pre tea, and blends have imaginative names, such as ‘Moose on the Loose’ or ‘Afloat with Folkboat’. The selection is bound to grow; come spring and summer, the tea team will explore the possibilities Nordic nature provides. “We want to break barriers when it comes to perceptions of traditional tea flavours,” Rantala notes. “For example, in the future we’ll be using beetroot in our teas.” Nordicness is a quintessential part of Nord-T teas – and one of its selling points, too. For a tourist, a cup of Nord-T is much easier to take home than a design sofa. Despite the organic teas and rooibos coming from Asia and South Africa, other ingredients are harvested from Finnish forests and hence the flavours bring to mind the nightless nights and unpolluted air of the northern wilderness. At the moment, the sales are split evenly between Finland and the rest of the world. New collaborators and distributors are continuously discovering Nord-T, so Rantala believes the international share will grow. The tea business has not only brought work to its founders. Nord-T collaborates with a whole bunch of subcontractors, especially in Finnish Lapland, and at some point there’ll be vacancies in the core team, too. Rantala explains that Nord-T would really like to be able to offer opportunities for young people. Young minds are open for new ideas, and Nord-T has been fortunate to have excellent trainees. To be fair, Rantala and Olin aren’t stuck in the old ways, either. Rantala notes that having a great co-founder has been essential for Nord-T’s story. “There are days when the whole world seems to collapse, and on those days it’s crucial to have a great partner,” Rantala says. “Mirka’s boyfriend once asked me what it’s like to go out with her – we spend so much time together it’s almost like we’re both dating the same woman!” Nord-T blends have imaginative names, such as ‘Moose on the Loose’ or ‘Afloat with Folkboat’.   Text: Anne Salomäki    is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Finpro."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/responsible-kids-clothes-street-cred/,Responsible kids’ clothes with street cred,"Finnish Mainio Clothing wants to create contemporary and ambitious fashion for children – and never neglect where it came from. When  ’s now 13-year-old daughter was a toddler, there weren’t many small Finnish brands available to dress the child in. Now, a decade later, there is an abundance of choice. “It’s astonishing really,” Vaissi says. “The most popular prints and designs can sell out really quickly, and they are much sought-after even as second-hand products.” Although Vaissi’s family no longer needs small kids’ clothing, she’s all too familiar with the struggles of finding good-quality, ethically produced items – both as a parent and a businesswoman. For about two decades, she has worked in various professions within the fashion scene. Now, having taken the lessons of her career onboard, she is the co-founder and managing director of  . Mainio was founded in 2013, but the idea had been brewing in Vaissi’s mind for much longer, though. “Meeting  , Mainio’s designer, was when the pieces came together,” she explains. “I felt like I had met someone who shares my vision and viewpoint.” The first collection was launched in 2014. Since then, Mainio has released two collections every year. Mainio’s sales abroad are continuously growing. The core idea behind Mainio’s brand lies in its relaxed, contemporary and street-style prints and cuts, convenience and comfort. Ambitious design doesn’t have to compromise practicality both in wearing and washing. When it comes to durability and quality, materials make a difference. All Mainio items are made using certified organic cotton. Vaissi also takes pride in the factories that produce all Mainio items. Mainio works with a company in India and later this year it will start collaborating with another in Lithuania, both with SA8000 certificates. “We personally know these places and the people running them,” Vaissi notes. “I’ve known and worked with the factory in India for the past 16 years.” Vaissi believes, and has noticed, that customers are willing to pay for social responsibility. Hence it’s not necessary to pursue cheaper production options just to keep the cost down. At first, Mainio only produced clothes for children. Soon parents wanted to wear Mainio, too, so Mäkinen and Vaissi decided to create a small collection for adults. On top of that, Mainio has a selection of home textiles. Despite the popularity of Finnish brands within the country’s own borders, Mainio has set sail for overseas as well, with resellers all over Europe, the US and in various locations in Asia. Sales abroad are continuously growing, and Vaissi is particularly keen to explore new opportunities in the Asian market. At the moment, the main challenge is the lack of pairs of hands: Mainio is run by two-and-a-half people, and Vaissi says there’s simply no more room on their tables. The team is on the lookout for a marketing and sales professional, maybe more than one, and agents who are present in the international markets and understand things such as cultural differences. One source of support and advice can be found among other Finnish kids’ clothing brands. “It’s been wonderful to experience the team spirit,” Vaissi tells. “People don’t think it’s dangerous to share information and help others. If anything, we’re all in the same boat, trying to go global together.” All Mainio items are made of certified organic cotton."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/footbalance-wants-make-step-lighter/,FootBalance wants to make your step lighter,"A unique concept has allowed Finnish company FootBalance to swiftly take the global insoles market by storm. In today’s society, we seem more focused on wellbeing than ever. We customise our workstations so that they are ergonomically correct, and follow keenly the latest news about the health benefits of various diets. But are we paying enough attention to what provides the foundation for the entire body – our feet? Finnish insoles manufacturer   would argue that the lowest parts of our bodies have been sadly neglected. The company has set out to correct this by making personalised insoles custom-moulded to each user’s feet. At the firm’s partner retailers – there are dozens of outlets in Finland alone – customers can have their feet analysed with the use of a podoscope, and have matching insoles produced on the spot. And there lies the catch: while it usually takes days or even weeks to make custom insoles, with FootBalance the whole process – from analysis to having the moulded insoles in your hands – takes less than 10 minutes. This unique advantage has allowed FootBalance to bring its custom-made insoles to the mass market, giving it the inside track over competitors – and spurring it to become a global player in the market. The origins of FootBalance go back to the founder  ’s background as a physiotherapist specialised in podiatry. He observed that patients were willing to pay hundreds of euros for custom insoles, while having to wait for them for up to three weeks. It takes less than 10 minutes to analyse and produce the moulded insoles. “I realised that if we could make an insole that would be at least as good, but quicker and cheaper to make, there would be a huge market for it – not only in Finland but internationally,” Hakkala recounts. The company first trialled its concept in 2007 with the sports retail chain Intersport, which quickly wanted to expand it to all its stores in Finland, and eventually also to shops abroad. From there on, the company rapidly established a worldwide presence: its products are sold today at almost 1500 outlets in 50 countries, with about 90 per cent of its sales coming from abroad. As for growth, the figures speak for themselves: over the past two years the company grew 26 per cent and 28 per cent respectively, and a growth of 30 per cent is forecast for this year. While the company’s original product continues to serve it well, FootBalance hopes its new, pioneering 3D scan technology will give it an even greater edge over the competition. Customers will be able to have their customised insoles scanned, with the point cloud output being uploaded to FootBalance’s database. From then on, the customer can order additional insoles from the firm’s online store, with the same exact mould. “Recently the basketball player  , who plays in Spain’s Liga ACB, got in touch after he had bought a new pair of shoes,” says FootBalance’s CEO  . “Because we had a scan of his insoles, we were immediately able to make a new pair and send them to Spain.” Although many presume that custom insoles are meant for medical purposes, FootBalance wants to stress that anyone – even people with neutral feet – will benefit from using them. “They’re just so comfortable. From time to time I try going without, but always go back to using them,” Hakkala says. “Once you try you quickly get addicted, and you’ll always want to have that same feeling. So, it’s kind of a drug for your feet, but legal!”   Text: Teemu Henriksson"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/spa-fits-bathrooms/,A spa that fits in all bathrooms,"You don’t need a fancy weekend away for that soft and pampered spa feeling; Finnish Luin Spa brings the luxury right to your bathroom, be it big or small. A hair product can do wonders. For some, it might even be a career-changing experience. A few years ago,   co-founder   stumbled across a hair towel: a towel that can be wrapped around wet hair after shower and fastened, so that it stays in place. A vast improvement to battling with a regular towel always falling off! “She thought it was brilliant,” Luin Spa co-founder  recalls of her friend’s reaction. “But she just wished it would be a bit more luxurious.” That’s where it all started for Luin Spa. Luodes and Mustajärvi, two friends from university that had dreamt of establishing a company together for years, decided it’s time to create the best hair towel in the world. Now, Luin Spa offers a huge selection of home spa products, ranging from – of course – hair towels and spa dresses, to hairbrushes and bodycare. Each item is designed with the spa feeling in mind. Despite its Finnishness, Luin Spa isn’t just for sauna or bath lovers. The core idea to help people feel and look good in their homes, even if it’s alone on a weekday night. But, let’s backtrack to the hair towels for a moment: they play a crucial role in the first steps of Luin Spa. To create the perfect towel, you need the perfect material. The duo wanted something hefty, soft and absorbent. “We quickly figured it’s cotton, and went through all sorts of samples to find a match for our needs,” Mustajärvi says. “For example, we travelled to Harrods in London to see what they had on shelves.” Co-founders Noora Mustajärvi (left) and Mari Luodes As neither of the ladies was a textile professional prior to jumping into the world of entrepreneurship, it came as a surprise that there are hundreds of ways to make a towel. Touching, cutting and testing came to just one conclusion: no one was spot on what Luin Spa wanted. Then   gave the budding entrepreneurs a list of manufacturers. A suitable one was swiftly found in Turkey. Whilst seeking partners, the Luin Spa team also spent time on design. They wanted certain colours, beauty and convenience. For example, the Luin Spa hair towel uses a snap fastener instead of a regular button. Soon Luin Spa decided it wanted to be more than just one product. The first batch of Luin Spa products to hit the shelves in May 2015 comprised hair towels, regular towels and bathrobes. Now, the selection has grown, as has the availability of Luin Spa. The brand has agents in various countries in Europe, resellers in even more and orders to the online shop come from all corners of the globe. Sweden started out as the biggest market, but now France and Italy are showing signs of growing  interest. This summer, Luin Spa will be knocking on a lot of doors in Japan. Pretty much anywhere poses a possibility. “Scandinavian design and colour combinations are hugely popular,” Mustajärvi points out. All over the world you’ll find people who are fans of the simplistic style.” Right now, the focus is all on further internationalisation and growing the global network of distributors. If all goes to plan, even the tiniest of bathrooms can be turned into pampering spas anywhere in the world. Luin Spa brings the spa feeling from head to toe.   Text: Anne Salomäki   is published by Finnfacts, which is part of Finpro."

Finnish Makulaku’s colourful and fun sweets have managed to convince those whose fancy isn’t tickled by traditional liquorice. In Finland, such is the love for copious quantities of liquorice, there’s a sweet known as ‘metre liquorice’,  . The colourful, overgrown sweets are a familiar sight at every summer event and most food markets – and a very common purchase for anyone attending those happenings.  from Porvoo, southern Finland, is responsible for almost all   manufacturing in Finland. Previously, Makulaku produced unbranded liquorice in bulk, but according to export director  , the direction has shifted to Makulaku branded products. With a fistful of new items on offer, Makulaku will not only brighten up the sweet shelves in Finland, but also hit the international market with a super sugar rush. “At the moment, about half of all production is exported, but the percentage is growing,” Alanen says. “There is plenty of potential in the international market, and we’re constantly looking for new distributors.” However, Makulaku isn’t after quick fixes and flash sales. The company wants to establish its presence for good, be it in a small sweet shop in Japan or a huge hypermarket in the US. Makulaku started out as a family business back in 1994. Some 20 years later, it was acquired by Makua Foods, a Finnish food company that produces and imports a wide range of food items in and to Finland. These days, Makulaku employs over 70 people. Export director Jorma Alanen Recently, Makulaku invested in a new high tech production line, with the intent to introduce various new products this year. The new machinery not only enables versatile and imaginative sweets, but also doubles the facility’s production capacity. “With these modern facilities, we can create state-of-the-art sweets,” Alanen explains. “We’ve been able to utilise Makulaku’s traditional strengths, further improve the taste and pack products of exceptional shapes and sizes.” Some of the new products have already found their way to supermarkets both in Finland and abroad. ‘Monkey Tails’ are of signature Makulaku style: eye-catchingly colourful, long liquorice stripes with various flavour combinations. Another newcomer hits two growing trends: Makulaku has rebranded its organic and vegan filled liquorices as ‘Happy Reindeer’. Alanen tells that the recreation of the familiar product has been very export-oriented, and it has also already been very well received by the Finnish audience. Vegan products in particular have seen their sales skyrocket in the past few years. According to Alanen’s knowledge, Makulaku is the only brand that offers filled liquorice that satisfies the cravings of all persuasions. In Finland, being able to say your product is made within the country’s borders is a strong selling point. In the case of liquorice, it can be so abroad, too. Alanen notes that Finland is internationally known for its expertise in liquorice. At the moment, Makulaku sweets are available in about 20 countries. More will be added to the list, and the company is looking into recruiting more people to boosts international networks and sales. Alanen believes the biggest growth potential to lie in North America, the UK and Asian countries, but every country poses new possibilities. Alanen believes that Monkey Tails are attractive in the highly competitive international markets due to their distinctive long shape, play value and candy-like colours. “New Makulakus are so colourful that they’re more tempting to many consumers looking for delicious, more sweet-like candy than conventional liquorice,” Alanen says. “The recipes are a result of long-term development. Products are tasty and simple, and artificial colours and flavours are minimised on purpose.” Monkey Tails are fun and full of colour. Text: Anne Salomäki"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/doerz-less-conversation-action/,"Doerz is less conversation, more action","Three young men in Poland, a new Audi and a one-euro coin led Tomi Virtanen to found Doerz, a global platform and service for sharing experiences. “Let’s go drive around and we’ll show you Warsaw!” Tomi Virtanen and his flatmate, both in their early 20s, were excited yet a little apprehensive about the suggestion posed to them by three young men in a café in the Polish capital. The two were on an interrail trip, and they had caught the trio’s attention by speaking a weird-sounding language (Finnish, that is). “We were outnumbered and in a city we didn’t know,” Virtanen explains. “But we weren’t going to say no!” For hours, the young men drove around Warsaw, communicating in broken English and even paying a visit to one of the boys’ grandmother. At the end of the day, Virtanen and his mate tried chipping in some money. The Polish guys turned down the offer, saying they just wanted to hear about an exotic culture and practise their English. “That really blew my mind,” Virtanen remembers. “After that, I’ve always wanted to meet up and hang out with locals when I’ve travelled, as I understood it makes all the difference.” This is the very core idea of Virtanen’s company,  . Through Doerz, locals can offer experiences for travellers, tourists – and why not other locals, too. The goal is to let people share their passion(s) with others, such as writing music, birdwatching or cooking with refugees. Doerz offers a platform for selling and buying experiences, as well as monitors their quality. Doerz has a two-member team, as Aliia Kodzhoshalieva joined the company as a co-founder last year. There’s room for a third, preferably tech-oriented person. Virtanen didn’t jump into Doerz right after his trip to Poland. Instead, he studied business and made a career in the world of money. During his studies, he was actively involved in the student union, as well as about a million others hobbies. He says he has a tendency to always start forming a group around whatever he’s up to. “If I train for a triathlon, suddenly I’ll have six friends I’ve talked into it, too,” he says laughingly. “It’s not that I need the support; it’s that if I’m excited about it and I find it cool, I want to share it.” Sharing is caring – and a growing business model, of which companies the likes of Airbnb are living proofs. Virtanen shares in other ways, too. “When I have an idea I want to go for, I tell everyone else about it,” he tells. “This way, I’ve got no excuse to bail out on it. I just have to do it, because everyone expects me to.” This happened with Doerz. Virtanen posted a video on his social media channels explaining the idea to ensure he can’t turn back. It worked: in April 2016, Doerz’s Paypal account received its first commission of one euro. This single euro had Virtanen toasting with coffee cups in the office. People were laughing, but to him, the euro meant more than its worth in currency – particularly looking back to his life pre-Doerz. “In my last job my salary was just absolutely ridiculous and I was driving a new Audi,” he describes. “I’m not sure if I’d have picked up a one-euro coin from the ground, thinking it might be dirty. I realised I was turning into a prick, someone I didn’t want to become.” The life after jumping off the payslip to the world of entrepreneurship has been much more unstable financially, but Virtanen doesn’t hesitate for a split second when he says it was the absolute right thing to do. “Now, I remember again what really matters.” The euro was only the beginning. At the moment, Doerz delivers experiences in some Finnish cities, with plans to expand to several European cities one by one. The destinations aren’t the obvious tourist traps like London and Paris. Rather, Doerz prefers to focus on the emerging locations and their hidden gems. The catch is to either be one of the 100 coolest people in the city, or to do one of the 100 coolest things. There’s no need to be a professional or have a company set up: all one needs is a passion for something, or the willingness to learn more about someone else’s. To Virtanen, it’s important to be able to do what he finds worthy. When working for others, he wanted to do something to support the integration of refugees – but he was given a solid ‘no’ by his superiors. Now, Doerz has done charity work with refugees, providing them with a chance to test out their business ideas. This isn’t a money honey pot for Doerz, as the profits go to Red Cross. However, to Virtanen it’s important to be able to do what feels right. “If the company benefits from this, it’ll be in forms other than money.” Keeping in line with their focus on community, new investors will be sought through a crowdfunding campaign this coming summer. The plans don’t end there: in the long run, Virtanen hopes to see Doerz as a comprehensive service for travellers. “The vision is that my phone would be able to suggest things and activities to me based on where I’m going, what I’ve been interested in previously and when I’ve got spare time in my calendar,” he says. “Instead of a passive marketplace, Doerz can become a proactive service.” Who knows: maybe the three Polish guys could get their tour on Doerz, too.   Text: Anne Salomäki"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/utopia-analytics-turns-volume-online-abuse/,Utopia Analytics reduces volume of online abuse,"Hate speech, trolling and misconduct are a constant, and growing, problem online. Until now. A new Finnish artificial intelligence-powered moderation tool gets rid of abusive messages in seconds. It was by complete coincidence   that became interested in text mining, the science of deriving quality information from large amounts of text. She heard about the topic while studying physics at Finland’s   and has not looked back since. “I went to an orientation session where they explained the amazing things you can do with mathematical algorithms and I was sold,” she recalls. “I changed my major there and then.” Skip read to today and Paukkeri is not only behind the world’s first PhD dissertation on language independent text mining, but the CEO and co-founder of Finnish artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics startup  . The 2014-founded company uses unique machine learning algorithms to manage, analyse and visualise large masses of text in any language. The company’s latest product, Utopia Moderator, applies this technology to tackle hate speech and misconduct online. Whereas human moderators need breaks and, no matter how capable, are limited with the amount of data they can process, Utopia’s AI-powered moderator keeps going 24/7. The software learns from examples how the moderation guidelines of a company work and swiftly removes any inappropriate messages, leaving only the most difficult cases for its human colleagues. Utopia Analytics’ moderator tool is opening up a completely new market. While spam filters and basic moderator tools already exist, they lack the language and learning capabilities of the Utopia Moderator. The patent pending technology is capable of understanding any of the globe’s languages and is not thrown off by typos or slang. “Language is used very carelessly on social media, but that does not matter to us, as we can moderate any writing style,” Paukkeri says. “We have compared our product to different spam filters and they can moderate 20-30 per cent of all hate speech with a high error rate, while we can moderate it all with high accuracy. It is a huge difference.” The attitude was nothing can be done about hate speech online and now we have a tool for getting rid of it. In a pilot project with one of Finland’s largest chat forums,  , Utopia Moderator helped to keep check on over 16 000 messages posted to the site daily. During the project the AI and human moderators agreed 90 per cent of the time. But the competition is heating up. In February, tech giant Google introduced its own moderator tool (Perspective API), but for Paukkeri this is positive news. “Its features are very bare compared to our product and it only works in three languages,” she explains. “In a way [the Google product] plays to our advantage. They can easily get publicity for the technology and people start to be aware that this is possible, which makes our sales efforts easier.” Currently, Utopia Analytics has customers in Finland and the Baltic countries. In addition to publishing houses, the AI moderator helps dating sites and online marketplaces detect illegal ads and misconduct. While the startup is now focused on expanding its international reach, its team of 10 employees (four of which have a PhD in AI or text mining) is also working on introducing new products and features. The first will add image moderation to its offering. Paukkeri says the technology can be used for any industry where large masses of text need analysing, from customer feedback to legal documents. “We see there are huge markets where we can help people to do their jobs,” Paukkeri says. “Already with our moderator product we have turned one thing upside down. The attitude was nothing can be done about hate speech online and now we have a tool for getting rid of it.” “The Department of Information and Computer Science was ranked among the ten best in the world in AI and machine learning in 2012” says Mari-Sanna Paukkeri, pictured here with Chair of the Board Tom Packalén. “The level of research is very high in Finland.”   Text: Eeva Haaramo"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-smart-city-innovations/,Five for Friday: Smart city innovations,"Smart living requires a smart approach, and Finland is at the forefront of this movement with its myriad solutions. Technological advances mean that the world is seeing a seismic shift in the way life can be lived, both now and in the future. In the midst of this digital wave of enthusiasm, the search for city-wide solutions is resulting in a rapidly growing number of innovations. Wondering about the Finnish approach? Look no further. The telecommunications giant has made great strides towards a smart future, supporting related infrastructure in  ,   and, well,  . “Through IoT and smart city concepts, we can automate our lives by connecting mobile devices to appliances, lights, roadways and just about everything – a shift that will improve efficiency and enable economic, social and environmental sustainability,”  , head of Zain KSA customer team at Nokia,  . Electric self-driving buses were launched onto Finnish streets last year, as part of the ongoing SOHJOA-6Aika project. Seeking to solve urban mobility challenges, these cost effective, energy efficient people movers can transport up to nine persons at a time. “The project’s main goal is to provide possibilities for Finnish companies to develop new product and service ideas in the open innovation platform, aiming towards road traffic automation,”  . Combining all existing transport services, such as public transport, taxis and private cars, into a ‘single-ticket principle’ via its Whim mobile application, this innovation has been gaining traction both domestically and in the UK. Last year, MaaS Finland also inked a partnership with Mobility as a Service Australia to potentially bring the Finnish innovation Down Under. , MaaS Australia director,   of Finland’s ecosytem within this sector: “This network of innovators and the support and encouragement from the government makes Helsinki and Finland a perfect incubator.” Together, VTT and CIB experts have drawn up a roadmap for the development and future of smart cities. “Rational and environmentally friendly energy consumption will become a key issue in the cities of the future,”  . “Preparing for sustainable and smart transitions will enable improved resource efficiency, cost savings and lower emissions. Predictive, individual and self-learning systems will consume less energy as part of energy management within buildings. The ecological cherry on top for Finnish achievement in this sector are the districts of  in Helsinki,  in Oulu and  in Tampere. Upon Kalasatama’s completion in the 2030s, it will house 20 000 residents, who are being encouraged to help create and trial smart solutions across all areas. Hiukkavaara, too, is a testing ground for energy-efficient schemes, and Vuores boasts innovations such as a forward-thinking traffic system plan and waste management system. “Today Vuores is the most rapidly growing urban quarter in Tampere,” project director   . “We are getting between 500-700 new inhabitants per year.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sensible-4-weathers-storm-self-driving-cars/,Sensible 4 weathers the storm for self-driving cars,"Self-driving cars may happily cruise along when the weather is fair, but add leaves or snow to the mix and someone better take hold of the steering wheel! Now a new Finnish startup aims to be the global pioneer in weatherproof technology for autonomous vehicles. Back in mid-March, visitors to Finland’s   were met with the unusual sight of a self-driving buggy cruising around in snow blasted from a snow cannon. This was not a student prank, however, but rather Finnish startup   demonstrating the technology it claims can solve a crucial problem with autonomous vehicles: how to keep them going in any weather condition. “Current automation technology is mostly being developed in California and Southern Europe,” explains , CEO and co-founder of Sensible 4. “But this kind of ‘flip-flop automation’ does not work in all four seasons, more like two.” By way of example, Santamala points to Tesla’s much-hyped autopilot. “It is not really autonomous; it is more a video camera-based lane guard,” he states. “But if it cannot see the lanes [due to the weather], it is easy to conclude what is going to happen.” Sensible 4’s ‘automation-in-a-box’ technology does not have the same issues. It combines a multi-sensor system (complete with thermal cameras and radar sensors) with proprietary algorithms to ensure an appropriate reaction to any changes in a vehicle’s environment. During the demo the buggy, loaded with the startup’s technology, was unfazed by the snow thrown in its path. “I ran, walked and stopped in front of the vehicle and it spotted me every time despite the snow – it did not run over its CEO,” Santamala says with a laugh. “We are doing this is because our automation system works in any season.” While Sensible 4 was only founded in February, the company has over 30 years of automation expertise behind it. Its technology comes from  , a startup founded in 2014 to commercialise the robotics research done at the Helsinki University of Technology (today Aalto University) since 1985. What brought Santamala together with GIM was a robot bus pilot he was running in Helsinki last autumn. We are doing this is because our automation system works in any season. “Their CEO   invited me over and gave me a bollocking – ‘Why did you use foreign technology in the pilot? It does not work in winter, our technology can adapt to this’,” Santamala recalls. “It sounded funny then, but we started to think about it and decided we should do this ourselves.” Now Sensible 4 is preparing to launch its first test vehicle in late 2017. This is when the startup’s claims of being winter-proof will be put to a real test and, if successful, the first pilots with customers will start in 2018. Sensible 4’s primary target groups are public transport and the logistics industry, such as bus and truck manufacturers, where Santamala anticipates autonomous technology will spread much faster than in private vehicles. “New technology is always expensive, but are car owners ready to pay for the comfort [of self-driving]?,” he asks. “The decision is much easier for companies as autonomous technology can directly reduce their costs.” The next step for Sensible 4 is to find the right investors to support its ambitious goal of becoming a global leader in all-weather technology for robot vehicles. But behind the company’s drive are not only the business opportunities, but a passion for better transport systems. Santamala would hate to see the same number of private cars exist 20 years from now and instead of being parked most of the time they would drive around largely empty. “We want to take the development in the other direction and help make public transport, car-sharing and robot taxes into such a great package that it encourages people not to own cars anymore,” he concludes. The calm before the storm. Harri Santamala (centre) believes Finland’s permissive legislation and supportive atmosphere make the county a good springboard for autonomous car technology."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kala-lappi-big-fish-gourmet-scene/,Kala-Lappi a big fish on the gourmet scene,"Finnish fish refining company Kala-Lappi uses traditional yet unique methods to smoke rainbow trout for local and European markets. Finland is known as a land of a thousand lakes and has approximately 300 000 kilometres of coastline. Consequently, as water is constantly present, fishing has become a popular sport, and fish a natural part of the Finnish diet. While there are a good many ways to prepare fish, the traditional method of smoking has been an evergreen approach over the centuries. Giving the fish a pleasant smoky aroma and beautiful colour, the most commonly used method to generate smoke for this purpose is by combusting alder trees. ”I grew up with the captivating scent of alder smoke, as both my father and grandfather were enthusiastic fishermen and fish smokers,” says  , CEO of fish refining company  . “The company was born from a passion for fishing. I have further developed the traditional crafts skills of four generations by utilising modern technology to make larger scale production possible.” By burning alder firewood, the rainbow trout acquire a lingering taste. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and some generations later there will be a prospering business that brings together traditional craft skills, one-of-a-kind machinery and modern technology. Kala-Lappi combines Finland’s highly valued duo of artistry and high technology, designing, developing and constructing its production technology to smoke fish itself. The top quality and unique end products are based on very special production methods that ensure their inimitability. “For our cold-smoked trout products, we have built a special cold room that is based on burning alder wood chips,” Vesa Lappi explains. “We wrote the code by ourselves for the machine, which allows 72 different phases to be used during cold-smoking, such as changes in pressure variation and the amount of smoke.” Kala-Lappi has currently four different smoked rainbow trout products that are on sale nationwide in Finland. Furthermore, the company exports its products for a first-class French gourmet chain, as well as to grocery stores in newly opened test markets in Denmark and Germany. Spain will follow later this year. “There is a lot of competition in this sector, and that’s why I am even more proud of how good a reception our products have received across the board,” Lappi says. “High quality smoked fish attracts people from all around and is considered to be exotic by many.” After starting from scratch in 2013, today the company has had negotiations in 15 different countries, employs 18 people and turnover is expected to hit 3.6 million euros in 2017. “Our strategy is to keep growing fast, but we need to keep it under control,” Lappi explains. “We have limited production capacity and before our new production facilities are in operation, we need to be patient with new openings in order to ensure the continuity of the current deliveries.” So far, all the products has been made of Finnish rainbow trout that has been fished mainly in the archipelago of Turku. In the long run, the selection will be broadened to other fish species. “I have some new products ready in my back pocket,” Lappi reveals. “I am confident that, if there is a strong demand even for smoked lake fish, there is a way to meet the demand.” Nowadays, when liquid smoke used for flavouring is commonly used and electric smokers are gaining ground, the classic smoking methods and knowledge have become exclusive and special quality. Kala-Lappi thus has what it takes to deliver these genuinely aromatic, melt-in-your-mouth Finnish gourmet flavours to the world. CEO of Kala-Lappi Vesa Lappi trolls for fish up to 850 hours annually. He founded the company after realising that he could turn his passion for fishing and fish processing into a profession."

Last week, Finnfacts organised a media tour for Asian journalists, together with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, to showcase what Finland can offer for elderly wellbeing. Solutions by name, solutions by nature. Healthcare professionals in more than 30 countries are already utilising David’s rehabilitation concepts for musculoskeletal problems. “There are approximately two billion people worldwide suffering from musculoskeletal diseases,“ says  , development director. “Our device’s properties and ease of use enable many applications for preventive healthcare especially with seniors.” This Finnish company offers the whole scheme of solutions for seniors. It is a communication, support and security system, which is applicable for memory-deficient patients as well. “The solution has been developed to support casual chores,” explains sales director  . “Our target is to help the elderly to stay at home for extended period.” Fitness for life is the goal of this company. Its air resistanct exercise equipment is on offer, along with world-reknowned computer-based training solutions for senior exercise, rehabilitation and wellness. “We use natural transmission, where resistance is adapted in accordance with force production,” says  , area manager, Japan and Asia. Breaking through the barriers surrounding digital healthcare services, this company has created a service platform that covers the complete virtual healthcare chain. “We understand the needs of the elder people and how they can benefit from our programme, as for some people pushing even one button is too hard,” CEO  tells. This NGO is a large provider of social welfare and healthcare services in Finland, including rehabilitation clinics for people with disabilities and service housing for the elderly.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/coruu-s-jewellery-is-light-as-a-feather/,Coruu’s jewellery is light as a feather,"Finnish jewellery company Coruu isn’t heavy on the shoulders – or ears or neck, for that matter. Now it’s setting sail to global markets with characters familiar to many: the Moomins and their friends. Sometimes   co-founders   and   struggle to truly convey the excellence of their silicone jewellery in words. “You need to touch it and keep it in your hand to really see how light and pleasant it is,” Fellman says. “Every day we get emails and Facebook messages from customers saying how, after trying Coruu earrings for the first time, they never want to wear anything else again.” A single Coruu earring, even if large and snazzy, only weighs two grams – which, in the jewellery scene, is essentially nothing. When Fellman herself has a pair of Coruus on, she keeps forgetting she’s wearing earrings at all. This is why, when approaching new resellers, Coruu tends to attach a few samples of their products. Although silicone is often associated with kitchenware and other household items, this makes it no less fancy a material for jewellery. On top of its lightness and softness, silicone suits people with allergies and is affordable and easy to wash. All this makes Coruu products an ideal souvenir for anyone with a light wallet and a heavy suitcase: it’s a piece of Finnish design that won’t max out your credit card and luggage weight allowances. The story of Coruu goes back to 2014, when long-time colleagues Fellman and Jokinen decided it was time to give entrepreneurship a go. Initially, their focus was on training in marketing and ecommerce, but then they decided to start an online store of their own. Silicone jewellery came to mind. For a shop on the Internet, Coruu products are ideal, as they are easy and cheap to ship, including internationally. No massive amount of storage space is needed, either. This Coruu Snufkin isn’t heavy; if anything, the exact opposite. The duo found three Finland-based designers, who were excited to jump at the new kind of opportunity. “The flat material is challenging, because you can’t make three-dimensional figures,” Fellman explains. “But our designers have created incredibly beautiful shapes, from feathers to flowers.” On top of unique Coruu shapes, the selection has recently expanded with a range of Moomin characters. With the license to sell Moomin jewellery, Coruu is hoping to enter Asian markets and Japan in particular. The Japanese are known for their fondness of the Finnish creatures. A lot has happened to Coruu between its founders’ resignation from their day jobs and now. Joining  ’s   and signing the license contract with Moomin characters have been some of the milestones. At the moment, Coruu products are available in selected stores in Finland, and there are ongoing negotiations with resellers abroad. A small company has to focus its marketing efforts carefully; according to Fellman, Japan, the UK and Sweden are now of Coruu’s interest. Now, in addition to marketing and visiting fairs around the globe, Coruu is also constantly creating new models and figures. The division of labour is clear: designers concentrate on their work, and Fellman and Jokinen spread the Coruu message internationally. Coruu has one full-time employee looking after the online store and a few part-time staff members. One indicator of how seriously the company takes the Japanese market is that the next recruit is probably going to be a Japanese-speaker to deal with customer enquiries. “Although there are other countries abundant with Moomin fans, Japan is by far the most interesting one,” Fellman notes. “It’s so populous that there’s a chance for big success.” Top left are co-founders Maarit Fellman and Sari Jokinen, and next to them employee Johanna Mäkinen.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/say-outloud-speech-therapy/,Say it Outloud for speech therapy,"Tampere-based speech therapy clinic Outloud has developed a range of mobile apps in order to expand the number of people it can assist. Speech therapist   had been working with children in her Tampere clinic for several years before she had her Eureka moment. Why couldn’t she update the old tools therapists use and make the process more fun and engaging? By combining her therapy expertise with help from relatives fluent in coding,   was created. “We believe that learning should be fun, and the key to continue speech exercises is motivation,” Sergejeff says. “Children play, and that’s what we need our apps to facilitate.” Outloud was established in 2013 with the idea of making digital games for speech-impaired children. The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation   and Sergejeff’s regional ELY Centre provided advice and support to get up and running, and since then they have released a total of nine mobile apps which encourage children to practice their speech. Outloud Timer 2 helps to measure time when it’s difficult for toddlers. “In May 2017 we will release  , our most entertaining and hilarious voice-activity game yet,” Sergejeff continues. “In  , a spaceship reacts to the user’s voice pitch and you can practice how high or low you can get with your voice.” The company targets its apps at people working in speech therapy, audiology and special education. Sergejeff points out that they can also be used by families at home to supplement the effect of therapy sessions. Moreover, Outloud is targeting big international markets. The company has already showcased its expertise at the American Speech and Hearing Association Convention and plans to return to the States again for this year’s event. “According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of speech therapists’ jobs is expected to grow 20 per cent a year,” Sergejeff says. “This is caused by the fact that 40 million Americans have communication disorders, and by the first grade around five per cent of children have noticeable speech disorders. In other words, the demand for speech therapy services is growing and providers need modern tools like ours.” According to Sergejeff, Outloud bases its products on extensive research and clinical use. The apps are also fine tuned to meet therapists’ needs during development, via extensive interaction with professions. The company also hones its software and healthcare expertise by working on subcontracted projects: one example is an app to help develop listening skills for adults with impaired hearing. But while Outloud’s present offering has a lot of potential it has even bigger ideas on the drawing board. “We hope that with our games therapists, teachers, parents and children will have even more joy and laughter than before,” says Sergejeff. “In the near future tele-therapy will be utilised heavily. In the not-so-distant future tele-therapy combined with VR tools will bring speech and language therapy to a whole new level. “Outloud intends to be part of this future.” “We believe that learning should be fun, and the key to continue speech exercises is motivation,” says Ulla Sergejeff (second from right)."

Wondering what’s up in kids’ toys and accessories in this northern neck of the woods? You’ve come to the right place. Taking its name from the Swedish word for ‘small swing’, these wooden swings became airborne in May 2013. “A swing is a universal product; it’s known all over the world,”  . “We have shipped everywhere from Taiwan to Canada, to all around Europe, Australia and the USA. Many have contacted us directly and also through our resellers in France, London and Taiwan.” In this, the year of Finland’s centenary, it seems fitting to take note of this local company, which has been producing wooden toys for the last 100 years or so. “A wooden toy needs someone to play with it,” sales manager  . “That takes imagination, which children have plenty of.” Finns’ love of reading is nurtured at an early age, with a range of local characters and stories on offer for kids to enjoy. Increasingly, this passion for the written word is being shared with other countries, too. “We are delighted to be in partnership with an established and trusted publisher in China, and we are excited about introducing   to children across China,”  , the founder of publisher  ,  . These nightlights look like cute, animal-shaped plush toys and can be stroked to change the intensity of the light or squeezed to switch the light on and off. “I myself have two kids and one of my co-founders remembers being really scared of the dark as a child,” Leeluu co-founder     in 2014. “We realised that fear of the dark is a real problem for many kids and it can affect the quality of sleep for both the kids and their parents.” This company offers a digital toy box filled with all manner of fun and learning for iPad, iPhone and Android devices. “Tapping, swiping, pinching and all other gestures come naturally for infants, even before they are able to dress themselves,” founder    . “So, shouldn’t there be content specifically created for them?”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/terhi-polkki-shoes-made-stories/,Terhi Pölkki Shoes are made of stories,"Finnish shoe designer Terhi Pölkki said ‘no’ twice when her friend asked her to come sell her shoes in New York. Third time’s the charm: now her shoes are on shelves across the US. LBD, little black dress, is a concept attributed to the legendary fashion designer  .  ’ office in central Helsinki has its own LBD: a little black mixed-breed dog, obviously known as Coco. “She’s with me at work all the time,” Pölkki says, sipping coffee from a Moomin mug whilst Coco is making herself comfortable on a cushioned chair. “I’ve had her almost for as long as I’ve had the brand, so about five years.” Pölkki shares the space with two other design brands, but today it’s just Coco and her, recovering from a flu. Soon, she’ll be the one flying around; she’s got trips lined up to such destinations as Portugal and New York. “I need, and will have, an assistant,” she says and sneezes. “When I’m off sick one day, nothing gets done!” For someone whose brand carries her very own name, it can be difficult to let go of the reins. Pölkki notes that there’ll be learning curves ahead trying to let someone else take care of some of the things she now deals with alone. “I’ve had a hard time understanding that I’m running a business here, not raising a child,” she admits laughingly. Terhi Pölkki It’s no wonder the shoes carrying Terhi Pölkki’s name feel like her offspring: she was 19 years old when her lifelong love affair with shoes had its first spark. She had always wanted to be a fashion designer, but working in a shoe shop during her gap year made her focus on footwear. After studying shoemaking in Finland, Pölkki was determined to do a master’s degree in London. “Getting into London College of Fashion had turned into a borderline obsession,” she tells. “My mum always says that when I was younger, I broke the walls down to get what I wanted.” So, she applied and got accepted to the institution of her dreams. During the five years Pölkki spent in London, she designed shoes for high street brands and travelled around the world visiting factories in India, China and Brazil. She started to ponder over how, in some cases, everything was dictated by speed and price over quality and transparency. “I figured that if we are to bring more shoes into existence, they need to have a point. I’m not a doctor or a saviour of the world, but I want to be able to say my shoes are as sustainable as they can be.” Terhi Pölkki Shoes was founded in 2011. At that point, she already had a clear vision of what she wanted to do: minimalist, practical footwear made from sustainable materials, wood and vegetable tanned leather. “If the shoe is ugly, no one’s even going to try it on; and if a beautiful shoe is uncomfortable, nobody will wear it,” she lists. “The three layers make a good shoe: appearance, comfort and convenience, and high-quality materials.” Terhi Pölkki Shoes are timeless and classy. Pölkki wants them to be noticed but not look last-season in a few months’ time, as well as practical for everyday wear instead of Christmas party glitter. She’s not the only one fond of these features: in 2016, she won the Taito-Finlandia award, and in 2014 the Accessory Designer of the Year award at the ELLE Style Awards. Shoes designed by Pölkki are manufactured in a small, family-owned factory in São João da Madeira, Portugal. All vegetable-tanned leather is locally sourced. Each design is named according to someone or something important in Pölkki’s life. This way, every shoe as well as every collection has a story of where she was in life at the time of the design process. Terhi Pölkki Shoes don’t grow old as the seasons change. “Coco has her own shoe,” she tells. “The other names are friends I studied with, a bar in London we always used to go, my friends’ children – people and places who mean something to me. A friend of mine said that essentially, my collections are a story of my life.” The shoe-shaped stories are for sale in places like Switzerland, Dubai and North America. Earlier this year, Pölkki  , which is a part of the multinational clothing corporation Urban Outfitters. Entering the US market happened partially by accident. Pölkki’s friend from university had invited her to the US twice, and she only agreed the third time. She instantly got a deal with a really good store. In general, Pölkki has been harnessing the breaking-the-walls spirit she had when she was younger. She emphasises that as an entrepreneur, particularly when going solo, one needs to have confidence in intuitions and not rely on outsiders’ advice. “What works for some might not work for others,” she explains. “There’s no manual or recipe for success – you have to build the road yourself.” These shoes were made for walking: for Terhi Pölkki, comfort and convenience matter."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/world-toasts-finnviini-s-success-with-finnish-wine/,World toasts Finnviini’s success with Finnish wine,"Two relative newcomers to Finland are putting their adopted country on the map with their internationally-renowned wines. Much has been written about Finnish weather. But, contrary to knee-trembling tales of perpetual darkness and frozen seas, Mother Nature’s heavy hand here up north can also open a world of opportunities. Upon moving to Finland for work nine years ago from Massachusetts, USA,  quickly discovered that the cooler climate here was going to play havoc with his favourite pastime. “Making wine was a hobby when I lived in the States,” he recalls. “I had been doing it for a number of years. But when I moved here I couldn’t order grapes, so I started to try local ingredients.” Cohen quickly discovered that aside from a thick layer of snow, another thing that Finland has in abundance is berries, and an everyman’s right to pick them from wherever one chooses. “I had no background in berry wines, but I tried them all,” he continues. “Most didn’t turn out well, but there were lots of good ones with potential.” One quickly distinguished itself from the bunch: the cloudberry. The result was so impressive that an idea swiftly began to ferment. Wondering what to pair with your Finnviini? Wonder no more. Award-winning for a reason, this raspberry dessert wine is perfect with chocolate and cheesecake. A sweet explosion of cloudberry partners perfectly with such dishes as  . The unexpectedly earthy, sherry-like qualities of this beetroot dessert wine go swimmingly with goat cheese. Help celebrate Finland’s centenary in style, with creamy Finnish cheese and this Suomi 100-approved bilberry dessert wine Game meat and duck go a treat with this bilberry table wine. This   sparkling wine made from cloudberries and Finnish honey is perfect for toasting – fitting as a limited number of bottles will be available from Alko in November to celebrate the Finnish centennial. Buoyed by his backyard success, David teamed up with his wife, Ecuadorian  , to found their own label,  . After earning certification from a wine production degree programme in 2013, the duo was granted a license to do just that in July 2014. Together they set out to fill the gap in the market for berry wines made from ingredients only found locally. Renting space at a winery approximately 110 kilometres north of Helsinki, small scale production soon followed. No berry remained unturned in their quest for new discoveries, with raspberries, lingonberries and bilberries being put to the test across the spectrum of time-honoured wine-making traditions. Nonetheless, in contrast to Finnviini’s rapidly expanding palate, the duo’s trailblazing approach was continually met with indifference from the local community. “A year ago, we had a zero-response rate when we contacted interested parties in Finland,” Cohen states. “There have been wineries here for 20 years, but no tradition of berry wine as a prestige product. We were attempting to sell to a market that didn’t yet exist.” With their cork stuck in the bottle, the duo became increasingly despondent. That was until a friend suggested that they enter some global competitions to increase their visibility. A much-welcomed trickle of recognition soon turned into a gusset of praise. Awards quickly piled up from Melbourne, Berlin and  . The duo then had to make room on the mantelpiece for one of the winemaking world’s most sought-after accolades: Finnviini’s Vaapukka Raspberry Dessert wine was awarded a Gold Medal and a trophy recognising it as one of the best wines in the world   in Paris. Organised by l’Union des Œnologues de France (the Union of French Oenologists), the competition attracted more than 3 500 entries from 45 countries, with almost half from France. Each wine was judged by fellow winemakers and given a score for quality. Vaapukka received the 11th-highest score overall, and the highest for any entry that was not a grape wine, thus earning the trophy for that category. This marked the first time a trophy has been awarded to a berry wine at Vinalies. Not done with their trailblazing, Vaapukka is also the first Finnish wine to be included in the French guide collating the 1 000 most notable wines of the world, to be published this summer. “We are putting Finland on the world map of wine,” Guerrero de Cohen states. “We believe we have something special.” Having alerted the globe to their ground-breaking enterprise, Finnviini now hopes to increase production, as they target markets in China, USA, Spain, France and the UK. “We will eventually outgrow our space,” Cohen foresees. “We need to find export partners and funding to buy equipment and market effectively. We are making a luxury product. Finnish berries grow wild and free for everyone, but when buying by the tonne, they are not cheap.” By sourcing ingredients unavailable elsewhere in the world, the duo feels its business model is truly sustainable. And, whilst they are keen to shower praise on the local raw materials, they are naturally less forthcoming about the complex methods behind their winning flavours. “Winemaking is simple: you put grapes in a barrel, leave them for a few days and you have wine,” Cohen explains, with a smile. “With berries, if you leave them for a few days, you come back and you have rotten berries.” Finnviini’s award-winning trio of wines."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/aeromon-takes-emissions/,Aeromon takes on emissions from above,"This Finnish company deploys sensors on the fly to help analyse emissions patterns in any industrial setting.  Finland may have some of the cleanest air in the world but that doesn’t mean walking down Mäkelänkatu in Helsinki is a fresh breath of air. In fact, looking up, you may spot a small drone carrying  ’s BH-8 sensor package, finding ‘surprising’ amounts of emissions above the traffic congested street. “You would expect the gases to dilute when floating up, but due to the turbulence in the air flow, even at 100 metres, there can still be quite a bit of emissions,” says chairman and co-founder of Aeromon,  . And Aeromon is determined to identify them all. After deploying its airborne sensors, the company uses its cloud-based service to analyse emissions patterns in any industrial setting. However, it was one environment in particular that the company focused on as it was getting off the ground back in 2014: ships sailing near the coastline. Taking inspiration from the TEDGlobal 2013 conference held in Edinburgh, where he witnessed a demonstration on their stabilisation algorithms, “I started thinking that hey, drones with gas sensors would be a cool idea,” Salo recalls. Drawing on his knowledge as head of technology at Auramarine, a global leader in supplying fuel systems, Salo knew that there was no efficient technology available to enforce emission regulations with ships sailing off the coast. Founding Aeromon (derived from Airborne Emission Monitoring) in late 2014, Salo assembled a network of maritime industry experts, and has cooperated closely with different research organisations in Finland, to develop the drone-based solution. The resultant modular BH-8 sensor package can detect more than 70 different gases and take samples of eight at a time. It then shares the data with Aeromon’s cloud-based analytics platform, where the information is cross-referenced with geographic data and verified. This hydrogen sulphide concentration map was enabled in real-time by an Aeromon drone and the cloud platform. “All of this is done in a package which weighs under 800 grams, so that it can actually be used with any drone that is robust enough to carry a professional camera,” Salo points out. Things have since moved swiftly for the company. In 2015, Aeromon tested its equipment as part of the  -funded Arctic Seas programme. “The aim was to monitor what fuels ships are using when on the sea and showing that drone-based technology can be used for that purpose,” Salo explains. Turns out it can, so well in fact, that in April 2016, Aeromon was contracted as technology partner for Greek company ALTUS LSA, to monitor shipping emissions Europe-wide for the next two years by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). Soon after launch, it also became clear that Aeromon’s drone-based solution could be applied to other areas, rather than simply for monitoring shipping emissions. The drones enabled Aeromon to get its sensors to otherwise unattainable places and even into toxic environments, so the company decided to shift focus onto to the much more comprehensive industrial emission monitoring market, worth several billion euros. In 2016, Aeromon completed pilots at the Ämmäsuo waste treatment centre with the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY), and at UPM and Gasum industrial sites to measure fugitive emissions. “The drones and the cloud platform enabled this real-time mapping of oil refineries and gas pipelines and all kinds of infrastructure,” Salo explains. “So that you can see the leaks on the map and pinpoint the sources.” Aeromon also found one more use for its solution: traffic emission monitoring. Now Aeromon is focusing on rapid international growth, and with environmental regulations continuously getting stricter across borders and across industries, Aeromon, with its drone-mounted solution, is well positioned to do just that."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-finnish-fashion-vol-2/,Five for Friday: Finnish fashion vol. 2,"There are plenty more than five globally interesting Finnish fashion companies. That’s why we’re doing a round two: another portion of world-class design from Finland, here you go! Earlier this week, Finnish fashion has been celebrated at the Fashion in Helsinki event.

Lovia doesn’t want to see valuable materials thrown into trash bins. The company sources locally and uses surplus materials whenever possible. Transparency is essential to Lovia’s ideology. Each product can be traced down to its origin, and all items carry a written introduction of its makers. “Hopefully we’ll be known around the world not only for our unique designs, but also for transparent production and sustainability,” founder  .  was 19 years old when her lifelong love affair with shoes had its first spark.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sulapac-shakes-world-packaging/,Sulapac shakes the world of packaging,"We’ve all heard about the huge islands of plastic floating in the oceans. A Finnish duo decided to start a company – and came up with a possible solution to the world-wrenching problem. In April,   published   about a Finnish startup collecting a million euros in its recent funding round. The company was  , and its innovation aims to challenge the dominance of plastic in packaging. The article was by far the most popular of the week on  , and it brought a fair few people to knock on the company’s founders   and  ’s, if not doors, at least email inboxes. In hindsight, we admit: perhaps our choice of stock photo wasn’t great. “A lot of people asked us if we do see-through packaging materials for food,” Haimi says laughingly. “One day we hopefully will, but not right now.” Sulapac material is based on wood and natural adhesive, which makes it biodegradable. It can also be mass-produced using methods and facilities that now make plastic, and it can make the cut for almost any kind of packaging. However, Sulapac is proceeding segment by segment, first aiming for the cosmetics market. The idea stems from the founding duo’s everyday experiences, or to be more exact, their bathroom shelves. “We were both frustrated by the fact that although the cosmetics product itself is ecological, the package around it isn’t,” Haimi explains. “It was a problem we both wanted to tackle.” Saving the world from the mountains and isles of plastic wasn’t what drove Haimi and Kyllönen, two academics working in medicine and biomaterials, to entrepreneurship. If anything, the opposite happened. This is the photo GNF chose for a breaking news story, and only later realised it could be misleading. “First, we decided to start a company together, and only then got the business idea,” Haimi notes. “I’d just been offered a position as an assistant professor at a university in the US, but becoming an entrepreneur was much more tempting.” The material wouldn’t have been brought into existence without the presence of   founders   and  . Their expertise added the much-needed wood into the mix. “Laura and I are the innovators and founders, but we always want to emphasise Petro and Anssi’s crucial input as well,” Haimi emphasises. With the million-euro funding, the material for cosmetics packaging concept is in further development. Sulapac is already collaborating with luxury cosmetics brand Niki Newd. In the future, new segments will be conquered. Haimi deems premium food packaging a potential next step. The long-term vision is to make Sulapac the dominating material in packaging. It can compete against plastic in almost every category, including price and resistance to water and grease. Only if the product needs to be stored for several years, plastic still beats Sulapac. The global plastic problem is no news to anyone, so it’s difficult not to wonder why no one’s ever come up with Sulapac or its equivalent before. Haimi gets asked that a lot, too. “We’ve been contemplating the same thing!” she says. “Traditionally eco-friendly materials have been deemed inferior to plastic because they’re considered costly, unattractive and less durable.” Hence it’s not enough to keep costs down and endure the same conditions as plastic. Appearance matters as well. “No one buys a luxury lotion in an ugly jar,” Haimi states. On top of fancy looks, Sulapac is investigating ways to stretch the material to tubes and bottles. If all goes to plan, one day Haimi and Kyllönen will have their inside-out ecological bathrooms. However, first global brands need to take the steps required to ‘environmentalise’ the status quo of packaging. Many are keen: Haimi tells that Sulapac has received requests from producers of all sorts interested in utilising the innovation. The idea is to stay mainly virtual by selling licenses and direct sales of the product using a carefully selected supply chain. The two-woman team is to grow with a few employees, and the near future will show how big the team will eventually be. Nothing is set in stone though. “For a startup, the first few months dictate the general direction. We’re agile and ready to pivot and change our business model if needs be.” Suvi Haimi and Laura Kyllönen are the power due behind Sulapac."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/time-machines-timeless-design/,Time machines with timeless design,"An abundance of great ideas has been born in the heat and humidity of Finnish saunas. One of them is Aarni, Finnish company turning wood into beautiful and sustainable accessories. Wood is an essential element of a Finnish sauna experience. Even if the stove is electric, the benches and walls tend to be made of wood, with its beautiful patterns of wood grain and natural scent. A sauna is where it all came together for three childhood friends  ,   and  . Two-and-a-half years ago, they were sweating in Alamäki’s home sauna, when one of them started to talk about a wooden watch he’d seen in Canada. “Finns appreciate natural products and wood,” Tuokko explains. “We figured, if it works in Canada, then why would it not work here?” They didn’t start from zero: Tuokko and Alamäki were business students on the brink of graduation, and Koivistoinen studied forestry. Business and wood were already big parts of the lads’ lives. “It didn’t take us many weeks to found  ,” Tuokko tells. “We did some background research, signed the papers and started to contact relevant people.” In about six months’ time, the Aarni webstore was opened. The trio had no outside funding and, despite their pre-existing expertise, had to learn a good deal of things about setting up an online shop, beginning from social media and digital marketing. The process has paid off. Sales are constantly growing, and many orders have come in through the grapevine. The beautiful pattern of wood would be difficult to copy. “It’s been great to hear from customers that they’ve actually seen someone wear an Aarni watch and liked it so much they want one, too,” Tuokko enthuses. On top of watches, Aarni also sells wooden sunglasses and wallets. Tuokko praises wood as a material for making accessories that touch the skin. “A wooden watch is really light, always warm and doesn’t make its wearer’s wrist sweat,” he lists. “Similarly, wooden eyeglasses are softer than plastic ones and more than anything, they’re classy. It’d be difficult to copy the unique pattern of wood.” Aarni didn’t create a whole new market, as there’s already a handful (pun intended) of companies that produce wooden watches. That doesn’t put Tuokko off. “If there was no competition, we could ask ourselves if there’s demand to begin with,” he rationalises. Aarni’s selling point is in Finnish wood, particularly curly birch. Aarni also wants to make sure the price doesn’t hike too high for regular Joes. A watch can be purchased for about 200 euros. Although none of the founding fathers is a fashion designer, all Aarni watch styles are created by them. All eyewear is based on classy, traditional styles. New models are constantly in development, based on customers’ wishes. For example, the first wallets were found too small by some, so bigger ones are in the making. “In addition to the feedback we receive, we’re guided by our personal visions,” Tuokko explains. “We go for what we find intriguing and good-looking.” The items themselves are manufactured by a partner in China, using Finnish wood and Swiss clockwork. Everything else is run by the trio in Finland. Responsibilities are distributed according to each owner’s personal interests, and routines are taken care of with joint effort. At the moment, the vast majority of Aarni items remain in Finland. Orders are coming in increasing numbers from abroad. For example, Brits have seemed keen to wear Finnish wood around their wrists. Aarni is planning to localise its website for foreign markets and start pushing marketing efforts outside of the motherland’s borders. Tuokko deems Nordic countries, the UK and central Europe particularly fruitful markets. Aarni is currently investigating the possibilities in the Middle East, too. There are no set goals or targets – apart from one. “As long as the percentage is up, the direction is right.” From left: Niklas Tuokko, Pyry Alamäki and Samuli Koivistoinen are childhood friends and Aarni founders."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/harkis-spices-fava-plate/,Härkis spices up the fava on your plate,"These days, vegans and vegetarians are in for a treat every time they enter a supermarket, with the selection of plant-based goodies having grown wildly in the past few years. One of the shelf- and stomach-filling options is Finnish ‘härkis’ by Verso Food.  CEO   isn’t fond of the word ‘meat replacement’.   meat has a negative tone to it; Ollila prefers  . “No one would want to eat   every single day,” she notes. “Our goal isn’t to replace anything; instead, we want to add more options on the table.” Tarja Ollila Verso Food, founded in 2010, develops and produces vegetarian foods. The flagship product is protein- and fibre-packed, soy- and gluten-free  , made from Finnish-grown fava beans. In Finland,   has been in stores since last autumn, and it’s become a household name. The first, unflavoured version has since been accompanied by seasoned alternatives. Finland isn’t the only country seeing the extent and variety of vegan and vegetarian products rapidly expanding. Now, Verso Food is heading abroad under the name Fava Mill, first in Sweden and Norway and later in continental Europe and the UK. Ollila notes that this is the right time for a company like Verso Food to go international, as both restaurants and consumers are growing more and more accustomed to testing new plant-based products in their kitchens. It helps to be from Finland, too. “Globally, Finland is known for its pure nature and clean ingredients,” Ollila notes. Initially, Verso Food used peas as the main source of protein, but fava beans took over in 2013. According to Ollila, who’s worked at Verso Food for four years, the company’s aim was to create a plant-based product that could be used in cooking similarly to minced meat.   was as close as it gets – and in many respects, better than its animal role model. “It’s sustainably produced, nutritionally balanced, made of Finnish ingredients in Finland and tastes really good, too,” Ollila lists. Veganism and vegetarianism seem to be growing trends that work in Verso Food’s f(l)avour. Ollila believes that consumers are increasingly aware of the ethical elements of their diets. “People consider ecological aspects, like the wellbeing of our planet, as well as ethical ones, including animal welfare,” she notes. “On top of this, there are various studies that show the detrimental effect of red meat on people’s health, which is definitely a factor when people choose what to eat.” Another thing is flexitarianism: consumers who choose to eat less meat and more plant-based, without going full-on vegetarian. Vegetarianism and especially veganism were previously sometimes seen as ‘either-or’ extreme choices, whereas now omnivores can easily grab a box of   or pulled oats instead of chicken breast or kebab – without being labelled hippies or animal rights activists. ‘Härkis’ suits all kinds of dishes; here used in a salade niçoise. Currently, Verso Food employs six people. All production is handled by a subcontractor, which has the capacity to increase volume as international orders start coming in. The first steps abroad will be taken with the existing product range. When it comes to future plans, Verso Food has a keen ear for customer feedback. “We continuously look for ideas and listen to customers’ wishes,” Ollila assures. “As we’re launching new products, we’re more than happy to hear what else is missing from the market.” Although vegetarian options are already relatively plentiful in comparison to just a few years back, Ollila doesn’t see companies similar to Verso Food as competitors. She prefers referring to them as partners. “The market is still so small I think that if anything, we’re supporting each other,” she explains. “The more alternatives there are, the more people deem them worthy for their plates, too.” Fava beans suit desserts, too. ‘Härkis’ granola boosts up the protein levels of sweet treats."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-sustainable-energy-solutions/,Five for Friday: Sustainable energy solutions,"With each passing day, the development of green energy and circular and bio economies is playing an increasingly important role in preserving our planet’s habitability.

These industry stalwarts are at the cutting edge of developing and supplying sustainable technologies for the pulp, paper and energy industries globally. “In the  , in Lahti, Finland, we use the circulating fluidised bed gasification process,” says vice president . “This method works by partially combusting the biomass or waste at high temperatures using a controlled amount of air.” Far from being a waste of energy, instead here waste is turned into clear energy by delivering   production plants and solid fuel handling systems for power plants and cement kilns. “Since 1980 when we started, the world has saved around 400 million tons of fossil CO  emissions thanks to the equipment we have delivered,” tells sales manager  ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jamifind-is-the-missing-link-for-musicians/,Jamifind is the missing link for musicians,"Looking for a band or bandmate? This Finnish startup has a playful solution.  Whether it’s a fireman, policeman, politician or priest, kids often scale lofty heights when wondering what they’ll be when they grow up.  was no different. Except, perhaps, for the fact that his dream eventually came true. “I’ve been playing music in bands since the third grade,” he explains. “Back in the day, new band members naturally came through mutual friends. But there were lots of situations when we needed somebody special that we didn’t have in our circle of friends.” Without an easy way to tap talent, these bands often languished as a result. Sure, community bulletin boards offered a sure-fire way to find fresh sounds, but this time-consuming process was, more often than not, merely a roll of the dice. Fast-forward to 2017, however, and Mäentakanen now holds the perfect musical matchmaking solution in the palm of his hand. “  is about building your CV for musicians; a LinkedIn for musicians,” he explains. “We welcome all musicians to our platform and don’t discriminate between genres or skill levels. We want people to start to play an instrument, or go and jam with somebody.” All aspects of the process are streamlined. Newcomers first create a profile and fill in some basic background info related to their instrument(s) of choice, skill level and influences. Photos, videos and sound can also be easily uploaded to their profile. Then it’s merely a matter of searching for other musicians or music teachers nearby, or letting the service’s algorithms do the work and find compatible matches. “I believe in slow, steady growth, and building a steady foundation,” Mäentakanen states (left, pictured with cofounder Slobodan Stanic). “People say you have to fail fast, or grow fast. Sure, in some cases you have to, but maybe people are giving up too quickly.” The service represents the pot of gold at the end of a two-year rainbow for Mäentakanen and cofounder  . The duo initially bonded over their mutual frustration with how the time-honoured bulletin board had been updated for the digital age. Putting their heads together, a solution quickly presented itself. A small seed round of 50 000 euros threw fuel on the fire, and they set about bringing their idea to fruition. Jamifind went live nine months ago, and has since attracted 2 000 users both in Finland and the UK. Now it’s time to pick up the pace, with the goal of adding a zero to this total by the year’s end, predominantly from the UK. “We are a ‘born global’ platform,” Mäentakanen underlines. One way of facilitating this is by developing the service further for music teachers, a move that will also broaden Jamifind’s reach as an education tech company. The effect of such is two-fold. In addition to serving a wider section of the musical community, this expansion into edtech also has appeal for investors and VCs. An angel investor himself, Mäentakanen is also keenly aware of attracting funding that supports his community-minded approach. “As an investor, I really have to believe in what each company is doing, and that it is important for the future of mankind. I would never invest in something that wasn’t doing anything helpful.” With Jamifind settling in for the long haul, what won’t be appearing any time in future is a price tag to access the service. Monetisation will continue to come from ads revenue, in order to keep the threshold low for newcomers. “This means that users can find band members and get jamming quickly,” Mäentakanen states. “The same goes with learning instruments: if you want to learn guitar, one click and our platform will show all guitar teachers within a 50-kilometre radius.” Nonetheless, whilst creative matchmaking remains at the forefront of the company’s ambition, Mäentakanen also gently reminds that it’s not called the music   for nothing. “Those cases when someone using our platform actively has found band members, it’s beautiful, that’s why we are doing this,” he states. “Of course, if we get money from this, it would be even better.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/32604/,VR is more than a game for 3rd Eye Studios,"Finland’s 3rd Eye Studios is less than a year old but is already turning heads in the virtual reality gaming industry. From the Highwaymen to Audioslave, via Cream and Them Crooked Vultures, the concept of a supergroup has been a mainstay of modern music. However, the idea of bringing together a troupe of creative heavyweights is far from a concept confined to the music industry. Case in point:   represents the meeting point of many of the big hitters in the Finnish games industry. Founded in June 2016 by veterans of Remedy, Bugbear, Moon Studios, RedLynx and Unity, the studio has set out to shake up the world of VR gaming. They aren’t doing this just by releasing games, either. They have much bigger plans, starting out with 3rd Eye Core technology and tools, and the   series. “We want to make big waves in the VR industry, so concentrating on just one of these things would not be enough,” explains  , co-founder and head of operations. “This company was founded because all of us are super excited about VR. We saw so much untapped potential that there was no other option than quit our safe jobs and found 3rd Eye Studios.” Downward Spiral: Prologue sees players negotiating their way through a tense space environment in zero gravity, accompanied by a soundtrack composed by Ville Valo. The public’s first glimpse of their work is  , the first installment of its thriller series  , due later this year. Here players find themselves in a tense, zero gravity space environment, accompanied by a soundtrack composed by   of Finnish love metal band HIM. As if the atmospheric tunes aren’t enough to put nerves on edge, the player must navigate through a spacecraft which has been deserted… or has it? “We are inspired by everything from old classics like the 1950s’   to modern TV series such as  ,” Johansson continues. “We are creating a first anthology series for VR, so we have a lot of creative freedom regarding theme, setting, characters and plot. Our team background comes from crafting award-winning story-based games, so you can imagine that the bar we are setting for ourselves is very high.” Players can make their way through the story independently, with friends, or compete in a death match against others. Having a fun and engaging game is one thing, but 3rd Eye Studios also believes it has solved one of the most prominent problems with zero-g VR games: motion sickness. This unfortunate side-effect tends to come from a disconnection between what the player’s body is actually doing and what the character is doing in the game. The studio reduces motion sickness with high performance rendering, a restriction of peripheral vision and the character only moving because of the player’s actions. And so, along with putting barf bags on ice, games only represent half of 3rd Eye Studios’ plan of attack. They are also working on 3rd Eye Core, a complete studio tool suite to help developers create VR games and mods. “It enables building games faster, more intuitively and reliably than ever before,” says Johansson. “3rd Eye Core empowers designers to create complete games without the need for programming. It allows shorter and more flexible production times, ensuring studios will ship their games on time and with confidence for stability.” The VR technology will be launched in 2018, but Johansson hints at even more big news on the horizon. “We are super excited about opportunities in China and Japan,” she says. “We will have something to announce regarding this later this year!”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-games-education-collaboration-clans/,Finnish games education is a collaboration of clans,"Much has been written about the impact of the Finnish games scene worldwide. Now, education is in the mix, with developers, gamers and entrepreneurs getting schooled in all aspects of the industry. Education expertise and tech are both areas where Finland shines on a global scale, as our recent   highlighted. However, educational games are not the only example of a perfect synergy between the two sectors: they also find harmony via a series of Finnish university schemes, with plans to educate a new generation of skilled gaming professionals. The most northerly of these is found in the city of Oulu. Located 600 km north of Helsinki, this isn’t an addictive mobile game à la   or  , but a unique lab concept for higher education built around entrepreneurship and multidisciplinary learning. “We wanted to create game education that really meets industry needs and produces professionals as ready as possible for work life,” says  , lab master at the  , which is the first of three educational labs developed by Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The lab acts as a pre-incubator programme and brings together advanced students from various subjects to work in game development teams. Here they build prototypes, products and eventually even form startups for the games industry. A key part of the process is pitching events where the best concepts are chosen to continue, while other teams are asked to merge with them. This is repeated until a selected few games are chosen for production. “This competition model prepares students for the actual situation in the games industry, because it is a highly competitive market,” Salomaa explains. “You need to learn to deal with that pressure early.” This philosophy is paying off. In April, Oulu Game Lab  , beating out competitors from 25 countries. Kajak Games is a student-led cooperative games publisher where students can earn study credits and commercially publish their own games. Kajaani University of Applied Sciences (KAMK) shares Oulu Game Lab’s vision and offers Finland’s longest running study programmes on game development and technology. KAMK, based in eastern Finland, emphasises real-world team projects ahead of theory, works closely with the games industry and international university partners. But the university’s specialty is  , a student-led cooperative for video game publishing with around 650 members. It offers students a simple channel to commercially publish their own games and dip their feet in the industry long before graduation. “The school buys the licences and equipment for the co-op and the students gain both study credits and income,” explains  , head of school, information systems at KAMK. “Typically, game projects in schools around the world are made up, not commercial, but we have taken the commercial-aspect a long way.” This commercial spirit is echoed at  . Some 18 months ago, it launched a fully-fledged game studio in Espoo as part of its games education. Students can apply to work in the studio and be part of teams commissioned to develop games for public organisations or help startups in product development. , head of studio, believes this is a good way for students to learn customer interaction, work in teams and manage the constant change in the industry. “In the real world the specs of a game project and the game itself evolve throughout the development process and it is important to experience this early,” he says. One of the trademarks of the Finnish games community is its openness and industry experts help mould future talent by sharing their expertise and time with students across the country. The Game Executive Program is a six-day intensive course for gaming industry professionals organised by Aalto University Developing Entrepreneurship (Aalto ENT) unit. A textbook example of this is the  , a six-day intensive course for gaming industry professionals organised by Aalto University Developing Entrepreneurship (Aalto ENT) unit, which is based in Helsinki. The programme’s focus on executive-level education makes it a rarity globally and it has been developed in collaboration with the industry to drill down into the leadership and strategic business side of gaming. “The Finnish gaming community is very strong and really believes in sharing their successes and failures with others, also with international participants,” explains  , programme director. “For example, we had 20 guest speakers from different companies last year who were really committed to sharing.” This important role of the Finnish games community is reiterated by Salomaa, Nikkanen and Huhtakallio. They all cite close collaboration with games companies as a vital element in education future professionals. “The Finnish games industry is hugely successful, but quite small,” says Salomaa. “Everybody knows and helps one another. This makes our operating environment fairly unique and we always get support from companies as they want to help others succeed.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/world-learns-finnish-way-educluster/,The world learns the Finnish way with EduCluster,"Fuelled by widespread praise for the Finnish educational model, this company is helping to improve learning on a global scale.  pauses for a moment and casts his mind back three decades. It was then that Finland began building the foundations of what has become the world’s leading educational approach. “Finland learnt from the world,” he recalls. “It went out and looked for solutions that might fit this country, brought them back and sewed them together in a certain way.” So successful was the country in constructing this quilt of knowledge, these days the flow of information is now reversed. At the forefront of this pioneering movement is  , a Jyväskylä-based company tailoring educational transformation solutions to its growing international clientele. “We are very conscious that there is no blueprint for education export aboard,” Marsh continues. “But there are problems out there and we try to weave solutions.” EduCluster Finland’s staff of 80 professionals are strategically located in Finland, China, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. A prominent member of the EduCluster Finland team since its inception in 2010, Marsh draws on his 30 years’ experience in developing Finnish education as the company’s director of innovation and outreach. “Early learning and vocational education are definitely priorities for us,” Marsh states. “The world wants to know how you change kindergarten teachers from carers to educators, and how to change vocational education into something respected and high quality.” Other areas of expertise for EduCluster Finland include language education, change management and leadership management. “How to take something as bulky and slow moving as education and how you can make change happen – this is what we now specialise in,” Marsh summarises. Given the current wave of global enthusiasm for Finnish education, similar companies have been popping up like metaphorical mushrooms in the forest. Marsh is undeterred. “The major difference between EduCluster Finland and other organisations is that we are staffed by experts in education,” Marsh underlines. “These are the people who make the proposals and create solutions.” Indeed. The company is owned by three prominent entities, which together span a wide breadth of learning: the University of Jyväskylä, JAMK University of Applied Sciences and the Jyväskylä Educational Consortium. EduCluster Finland’s staff of 80 professionals are strategically located in Finland, China, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. The Middle East is a region of considerable growth for the company, alongside Mexico, Chile and Vietnam. The company continues to break ground in new markets, with Kazakhstan an example of the fertile soil being cultivated in recent times. Much of the demand for the company’s expertise can be attributed to the emerging middle classes of developing nations that have grown disillusioned with their public systems. “One powerful thing about the Finnish approach is that it is evidence-based,” Marsh states. “It’s courageous and continuously tests what it is doing.” “Public education systems are very slow moving creatures in many parts of the world,” Marsh underlines. “Money is not put into them, teachers are poorly paid and often not given a lot of respect. Very often they are political footballs.” The last decade has seen parents realising that “look, it doesn’t have to be this way. What we are good at here at EduCluster Finland is putting something in the system that is a catalyst for rapid change.” Alongside meeting the needs of the rising middle class, Marsh also points to wider issues that the company has a hand in abating. These include everything from reducing dropout, which can be more than 30 per cent in some countries; boosting social equity and inclusion in the public sector; building young people’s inner self-confidence and ‘hunger to learn’; all the while demonstrating that ‘working together works’. Regardless of the challenges presented by each project, EduCluster Finland’s goals remain transparent. In a crowded marketplace where the mere mention of Finnish education is catnip to prospective customers, Marsh emphasises the depth of substance beneath the company’s surface. “Our strength is not to ride waves of illusion, but show what is under the waves if you want to swim effectively and well,” Marsh says. “The pleasure of this work is approaching real life challenges not just from a commercial point-of-view, but also with an ethos of trying to do the right thing in the best way.” With revenue of 7.5 million euros last year, the globe is certainly responding to EduCluster Finland’s inclusive Finnish approach, one which is continuing to build the foundations for future generations. “Kids entering school these days are going to retire at around 2080, so we’ve got to be giving them the competences for the next 50 years,” Marsh underlines. “That sense [of duty] is very powerful, and that’s what the world wants to grab.” Finnish education is truly becoming a global phenomenon, thanks to EduCluster Finland’s successful projects."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/three-cheers-uplause/,Three cheers for Uplause,"Uplause, a state-of-the-art global actor and forerunner in interactive fan engagement and event advertising, is promoting unforgettable live event experiences all around. Imagine a full stadium. A tense world-class match is underway, hopes are high and the atmosphere is heady, while fans are doing their utmost to break decibel records. The core concept of this comfortingly familiar image has remain unchanged throughout the ages, yet thanks to new mobile, social and digital technologies, fan engagement is more fun than ever. At the forefront of facilitating engaging user experiences for large audiences is Helsinki-based crowd and gaming software developer  . “Nowadays, spare time is considered as a highly valued luxury and therefore is an extremely competitive part of people’s social lives,” explains  , co-founder and executive vice president. “Our response is to create activating content around the core function of an event that gets people involved. I am proud to say that we are pioneers with our unique platform in this new and growing industry.” The Uplause Live Event app can measure the decibel level of crowd enthusiasm when they are shown pictures and videos taken by users. Uplause’s core focus is its patented software, Uplause Engagement System, setting the stage for dynamic live events that contain digital and social interactions, such as a   that automatically captures and displays true decibel levels of fans in stadiums and arenas. Altogether, the company’s portfolio includes a library of more than 25 different crowd games. These include classic live event features like interactive kiss and dance cameras to maintain the good vibes during breaks in the action. The company also specialises in a variety of sport games, such as basketball, ice hockey and motor racing to keep crowds entertained, as well as tying in with brand categories across beverages, airlines and banking. The modern era of mobile apps means that Uplause Mobile brings even more added value to the live event framework. Fans can participate in trivia, quiz, voting or games using their mobile device. Live scoring or real time voting is then displayed on digital signage at the venue, along with trivia results. “Not only the fans at venues, but also TV broadcasters are willing to utilise Uplause,” Aura adds, “because we can provide specific live stream of the interactive feature for audience watching TV at home.” Until now, Uplause has been making its presence felt in over 20 countries, including more than 100 venues and 30 million fans engaged. Such has been company’s success that turnover has increased by 100 per cent annually for each of the last three years. The most important market areas are in North America and the major economies in Europe, but it is growing in Asia as well. “We have good momentum,” Aura reasons. “The growth potential is still huge, as there are many markets we haven’t entered yet.” Half of the Uplause client base consists of sports teams and leagues, whereas the remainder are either brands or sponsors. “While teams have more focus on fan engagement, sponsors spend a lot for the visibility and possibility to be connected to a brand or a team,” Aura reveals. “According to studies, as many as 90 per cent of the people who participate and interact with authentic crowd games at live events will remember the brands involved. That is powerful.” Uplause’s might has spread to some notable sports on the world stage, most recently at the French Open tennis tournament. Across the pond in the US, last season nine National Football League teams, including the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets, used the system to improve their match day events. It’s not just sporting crowds who enjoy Uplause’s offering, with music festivals such as Rock in Rio among the events keeping people entertained thanks to this northern pioneer. The company has built its audience gradually since it was founded in 2009 by a couple of Finnish tech-scene heavyweights with a background in companies such as  . After joining forces the duo then laid the groundwork for their platform and technology for stadia crowd pulling and entertainment. These days, to keep in step with the times, Uplause has two main focal points for growth: new customers and product development. “When we first got this idea of crowd games, it was because we realised that live events weren’t using the latest technology, and that was in 2009,” Aura explains. “The progress in the tech field has been dizzying from there, to the point where now we are looking where we can go with AR and VR technologies.” With this in mind, envisage that full crowded stadium you always wanted to reach, but it is located on the other side of the world. This dilemma is being solved in the not too distant future with the virtual and augmented technologies of tomorrow, where all fun and games will truly come to life in the comfort of your own home. On behalf of these sports fans, a round of applause, for Uplause."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-innovative-packaging/,Five for Friday: Innovative packaging,"It’s often said that big things come in small packages, but in Finland, big things can also be found in packaging. Looking for a packaging solution with a decidedly Finnish touch? Well, you’re in luck! Here are five solutions to help get you packing. This smart packaging startup raised 250 000 US dollars in angel funding last year to further develop the Internet of Packaging. By using unique coding and sensor technology, the company enables everyday packaging to communicate. “Magic Add specialises in cost-efficient, high-volume smart packaging, making it the cheapest and most effective way of embedding intelligence in packages,” president and CEO  . The mantelpiece at Metsä Board has been getting a little short on space recently, after racking up the Luxe Pack Shanghai ‘in green’ Award for its  . Not to mention the awards for its T2 Mini Fruit Tea packaging and Elevated drink box at the   and  . “We are delighted with this level of recognition,”   Metsä Board  , after the iF Awards win. “[The awards] reflect our primary aim of helping customers enhance brand value by delivering sustainable, safe and innovative paperboard-based packaging solutions.” What’s for pudding? Award-winning convenience, if you ask Valio. The company’s dessert pack came first at the revered World Star competition in 2016 in the Packaging category. “The pot has an inventive design that makes it easy to plate the pudding beautifully,”  . “You just tap the bottom of the pack three times, which releases the vacuum and the pudding gently slides out onto the plate. In addition, the chosen packaging material is polypropylene, which is easy to recycle.” Based on wood and natural adhesive, this biodegradable innovation is a natural alternative to almost any kind of plastic packaging, and can also be mass-produced using methods and facilities that now make plastic. First port of call: the cosmetics market. “We were both frustrated by the fact that although the cosmetics product itself is ecological, the package around it isn’t,” co-founder    . “It was a problem we both wanted to tackle.” Bidding farewell to polystyrene packaging, these corrugated board boxes made from Finnish wood fibre keep fish fillets fresh. Developed by Finnish companies   and   the world is sitting up and taking notice, with the innovation recently   in the WorldStar Sustainability Award in May in Düsseldorf, Germany “We have a packaging solution that allows us to deliver our fish products in the same high quality manner as before, but with a smaller carbon footprint,”    , sales director at Kalaneuvos – V. Hukkanen. “This ecological solution also makes recycling and waste management easier in stores, restaurants and industrial kitchens.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/dottir-not-ordinary-law-firm/,Dottir is not your ordinary law firm,"What used to be a shipyard in Helsinki is now a hotspot for all things hip – and potentially one of the coolest and most startup-minded law firms in town. Thinking about a generic law firm office springs to mind certain images. Located in a wealthy area, perhaps it’s equipped with a butler? Maybe suits, ties and pencil skirts abound? How about flawless piles of paper and wall art that could never possibly manage to provoke anyone? Something you probably were   thinking was a skateboard ramp in the kitchen. Or a witty   painting in the meeting room where, instead of bisquits and breadrolls, there are smoothies, nuts and cherry tomatoes waiting for guests. Yes, managing partner   and partner   are wearing suits, but pretty much nothing else about   is like in your ordinary law firm. The skateboard ramp is the icing on the cake. “It’s not really used in the daytime,” Innanen reveals. “But in the evenings it can get noisy.” Dottir, founded in its current form in 2016, comes across very startup-like – and it’s no accident. Dottir targets startups and growth companies, particularly in the field of technology, and helps them with whatever comes their way from shareholder’s agreements to trademark registration and intellectual property rights. For bigger companies, Dottir sticks to the firm’s niche areas, such as intellectual property, IT and data protection. Jukka Pello and Antti Innanen. “We weren’t creating an office that would appeal to absolutely everyone but one that pleases us,” Pello explains. “We’re confident that like-minded people will find it cool as well.” There’s a level of symbolism in the office space, too. The building, just by the Baltic Sea, used to be a shipyard. Now it’s packed with enthusiasm for modern, digital and design. “Traditional industries are giving way to new things,” Innanen notes. “We believe our customers have plenty of international potential, and it’s only growing.” Dottir initially started as a two-man band in 2014. Last year, the concept changed and new people stepped into the game. Now Dottir is run by six partners, all equal. On top of the hip Helsinki office, the company has a base in Berlin and another in San Francisco. The team totals 19 people, with further recruitments and expanding US operations in its immediate plans. Although Dottir has been successful in its endeavours, it hasn’t forgotten where it came from. The company offers various free, no-strings-attached services to support budding entrepreneurs, such as a  . Just a while ago, Dottir launched a search engine, Searchabrand, which informs people if their planned brand name has already been registered or used on e.g. social media. Such services don’t tend to be highly profitable for law firms, so giving a free hand isn’t a huge hit on Dottir’s wallet. However, later the startups might be in need of more sophisticated assistance, and then they’ll remember who was there to support them early on. “If companies choose to go elsewhere, it’s fine, we’re not jealous,” Innanen says laughingly. “Those who share our values are likely to come back to us.” Currently there’s no intent or aim to monetise the website. Even if it doesn’t bring about direct sales leads or contacts, at least it’s spreading Dottir’s name. Everything else is a bonus. Dottir’s selling point is being top-notch in its specialities and understanding of the startup ecosystem. The international offices serve not only local customers, but also Finnish companies wanting to test the foreign waters with their products, services and innovations. There might be new offices popping up in new areas at some stage, if suitable candidates make themselves known. Dottir is also at the forefront of a new kind of service known as legal design. This is a combination of law and service design. “Legal documents are often poorly designed and not very customer-friendly,” Innanen explains. “This is an issue particularly with big corporations.” Pello points out that especially when the target audience includes all sorts of demographics, it’s essential to convey the core message understandably. “Legal texts don’t need to be complicated. Legal design weaves together the letter of the law but in a form designed to be understood.” In general, Dottir is fond of and believes in new ideas. Innanen notes that Dottir can only grow if its customers do – and he’s optimistic. “We’ve got a small country with an abundance of tech expertise,” he says. “Some see digitalisation as threatening, but we want to believe it creates prosperity and wellbeing,” Pello adds. A law firm office with a view, and not the most generic one."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kieku-makes-noise-thought/,Kieku makes some noise for thought,"This independent media startup has launched a new kind of audio listening service: a YouTube for podcasts. It seems fitting that Helsinki startup cluster   is located inside a former hospital. Here amidst the x-ray rooms, long corridors and operating theatres of yore, dozens of startups are undergoing treatment, soon to be discharged into a world of success. Nonetheless, given that some of the walls inside the building as are still lined with tiles, surely negotiations don’t get that bloody these days, do they ? The CEO of media startup   bursts into laughter. “It’s a cosy community,” Fabritius admits, nodding ‘hello’ to a passing trio of peers. “Companies here have been selected for the cluster because they are at the same stage of development. People are like-minded and everybody is sufficiently crazy…” He stops mid-sentence. Time for a little backstory. Fabritius’ tale is a familiar one for many former Nokia employees. Finding himself surplus to requirements after 17 years of service at the Finnish telecommunications giant, his engineering expertise is now being enthusiastically applied elsewhere. “What I really liked about working for Nokia was the awareness that the future doesn’t happen, it is always being made by somebody,” Fabritius says. “That same ‘crazy’ mentality that you can forge the future is very active in the startup scheme of Helsinki.” “Somehow it feels that companies have forgotten their role as being transformative in society,” Fabritius (centre) outlines. “I like Henry Ford’s wisdom in that aspect that every employee of the car factory should be able to afford to by the car. If they don’t, then you run out of customers.” For Kieku, the tool for sculpting the horizon comes in the shape of a podcast content provider, which is tailored to listeners’ interests at the push of a button. “We are not focused on ‘click this and laugh’ content, more so the stories that might stimulate thinking,” Fabritius explains. “Kieku makes it easier for people to find inspirational and brainy content. Better thinking leads to a better life and better ideas.” Fabritius points out that Kieku’s ideal audience is “people who want to understand what is going on the world – whether they are entrepreneurs and have the need to understand where we are going, or people interested in wellness, society and humanity.” In order to facilitate this, the company deploys an elaborate AI system that quickly learns user habits and creates a customised feed of relevant topics. “We are not building an algorithm that maximises revenue from ad sales, like Facebook or YouTube,” Fabritius states. “The moment you turn to ads sales, the purpose becomes maximising ads revenue. This is not the goal of the company. We wish to genuinely help people, and make the AI useful.” The service aims for both ends of the spectrum: the listener and content producer. Adding to the growing library of audio on offer, bloggers can also upload their own material at a price, made easily sharable at the push of a button. Further monetisation comes from a  -style service, which sees listeners rewarding content creators and Kieku taking a slice of each transaction. The sense of community is cemented by the fact that users also police content, helping to weed out inappropriate subject matter. Now, a month after launching, the company is already looking for growth abroad. One major hurdle to overcome on this quest is that “people have certain expectations of talk media”. According to Fabritius, this is set to change in the near future. “If you look at the media industry, TV has gone social with Facebook and YouTube videos and newspapers have gone digital with blogs and Facebook being used for news distribution,” he states. “Also, music listening has gone social with Pandora and Spotify playlists.” Podcasts are next in line, tipped to break free of the radio show format shackles. “Just like blogs transformed long form journalism to five- to ten-minute reads, the audio format is likely to change news listening to short, tasty information bites,” Fabritius states. “We are riding the wave of making talk media social. There’s a joy in creating something new.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arch-red-goes-inside-box/,Arch Red goes inside the box,"A few years ago, Finnish Arch Red swallowed an Australian partner much bigger than itself – and didn’t choke. Now it’s taking on the world with full force. The Internet provides plenty of information about network function virtualisation, NFV. However, sometimes the explanations can be difficult to get one’s not-so-techhead around. CEO  and sales director   from Tampere-based  : explain to me like I’m five, please. “The network infrastructure had been based on physical routers and firewalls, which have all been dedicated devices, ‘boxes’,” Huhtanen begins. “The new concept, NFV, means that we move on from dedicated boxes to virtual functions. The transition is similar to when companies stopped running their own, physical data centres and instead started buying the capacity directly from the cloud of an outsourced provider.” NFV is, then, an ‘internal cloud’ in which the company can run its network functions virtually. This makes a lot of sense: previously, when a company needed to add capacity to its firewall, it needed to order a sturdier box, wait for its delivery and find people to configure it, all of which might take up to several weeks. Now, instead of the operator having to invest and the customer having to wait, the virtual software can make the exact same changes, even automatically, in minutes. No need for costly machinery and manual labour, and meeting the needs of individual customers is easier and faster than ever. Arch Red took over Radiator from its Australian partner. In this vast ocean of zeroes and ones that NFV is, Arch Red has its own niche: AAA, in other words authentication, authorisation and accounting. Whenever and wherever a user joins any given network, the user must be recognised and authenticated. “If you dial a call somewhere in Europe, your phone number indicates certain things about you to your operator,” Stenhäll says. “It must know, for example, what kind of subscription you’ve got and what services are included.” When multinational operators have a dozen mobile networks in just as many countries, a big pile of boxes is needed. Or, better said, used to be. Now Arch Red can provide them with Radiator, a single software that renders the box army redundant. The same goes to operators that serve customers in a single country but use several networks, like WiFi and mobile. With Radiator, user authentication for all these networks can be dealt with using just one tool. Initially, Radiator belonged to Australian Open System Consultants (OSC), and Arch Red was the company’s partner in product integration and customer support. A few years ago, OSC founders wanted to focus on their new business and transfer Radiator in the hands of the Finnish team. In 2013, Arch Red purchased all shares, and now OSC is its subsidiary. At that point, Arch Red had a turnover of a few hundred thousand euros, whereas that of OSC was more than a million. Stenhäll admits that the risk was significant – but worth taking, as the subsidiary’s turnover has since been doubled. Tables have turned since. When previously Arch Red was the one selling and supporting Radiator, now it focusses on product development. The team consists of 14 full-time employees, as well as a team of over 50 distribution partners around the globe. Approximately 80 to 90 per cent of sales goes abroad, the majority to Europe. The markets in Asia and the Middle East are growing. “By default, the product is usable all over the world,” Huhtanen says and points out that Radiator is capable of challenging big, traditional multinational players. “This opens up an abundance of opportunities. You could say we’re reaching for the clouds and so is our growth.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-midsummer-festivities/,Five for Friday: Midsummer festivities,"In Finland, Midsummer not only represents the annual turning point for the lengthening daylight, it also marks the unofficial arrival of warm summer weather.  Traditions surround the celebration of the summer solstice, with the longest day of the year typically spent with friends and family at a summer cottage away from the city, either partying or relaxing. Nonetheless, nowadays, there is also a wide variety of alternative approaches to well-trodden Midsummer revelries. So, without further ado, for this Friday preceding Midsummer, we are taking a brief break from our typical roll out of innovations. Instead, enjoy a quintet of ways to celebrate during this centenary year of Finland’s independence. Having become the new standard for youngsters’ Midsummer, festival-goers will once again congregate for a three-day celebration far from the urban sprawl to enjoy a roster of artists from home and abroad. “The festival is all about having a great program,”  , festival director explains. “We cherish the good time on the beach, as Kalajoen juhannus is not just another festival. With decades of experience, we know how to party.” For an experience of a more mature nature, there’s an abundance of open air dance pavilions scattered around the beautiful Finnish countryside. A very popular meeting place during the warmer months, Midsummer dances are a particular highlight of the summer for many. “Our dance pavilion, Nurmen Lava, was built in 1902, hence it is the oldest one still in operation,” says  , the responsible organiser in  . “We are preparing the pavilion for Midsummer dances with traditional birch tree decorations.” Back in the day, Midsummer was a very potent night and the perfect occasion for children to perform small rituals, and also especially for young maidens seeking suitors and fertility. This old-time spirit is elicited still in many places, such as this family-friendly Midsummer Bonfires event in Seurasaari Island not far from downtown Helsinki. “The festival grounds in our island offer for example lots of fun workshops for children, as well as characteristic bonfires from different provinces of Finland,” tells  from  . Not everyone is fleeing the cities these days for Midsummer festivals. In recent years, this urban Midsummer city festival in Tampere has become a popular alternative to traditional goings-ons. “All it takes to bring the Midsummer feeling to the heart of the city is great music and the festive atmosphere brought by cheerful people,”  , managing director of   explains. “Even the restaurants involved are part of creating the good mood by decorating their terraces properly.” Every year, expatriate Finns all over do their best to let it be known what the traditional Midsummer celebrations, such as lighting bonfires and bathing in saunas, are all about. This event in Berlin is but one of the many on offer during Finland’s centenary year. “We welcome each and every one to explore Finnish midsummer traditions and enjoy a music programme that comes alive at the Finnish Embassy in Germany,” says ambassador  . “We will turn the inner court of the Nordic Embassies in Berlin into a summer landscape, where all the visitors will have a taste of the finest pieces of Finnish Midsummer including the scent of birch trees, delicacies and, of course, a sauna.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/molkky-makes-summer-weekend/,Mölkky makes a summer weekend,"In just 20 years, outdoor game Mölkky has become a tradition at Finnish summer cottages and Parisian parks. Now, it’s aiming to take over the rest of the world. Visiting Helsinki, or any city in Finland, this weekend might make tourists feel like they’re the only ones who’ve not been invited to a party. They might not be bending the truth; a lot of Finns are heading to the countryside to celebrate one of the year’s biggest festivities, Midsummer or   in Finnish. Aside from food, sauna and dips in the lake, a game known as   is a popular way to spend time with fellow celebrators. It includes a dozen wooden skittles, which are all marked with numbers and supposed to be knocked down by players taking turns in throwing them with yet another skittle. , invented in Finland in the mid-‘90s, isn’t just a summer cottage privilege. It’s a common sight in city parks, too – especially in Paris. You’ll need 12 numbered skittles, a   throwing skittle, a scoreboard and friends or strangers to play with. The skittles are placed in a formation. A throwing line is drawn three to four metres away from the formation. The first player throws (always underhand!) at the group of skittles and tries to knock them over. After a throw, fallen skittles are put upright where they fell. If one skittle falls, the score is the number on the skittle. When more than one fall, the score is the number of fallen skittles, regardless of the actual numbers written on them. If a player misses (has no score) three times in a row, he or she is out of game. The game ends when the first player reaches exactly 50 points. If one scores over 50, the player’s score is reduced to 25. “In France,   is a bit of a celebrity already,” says  , sales director of  , the company that currently owns the rights of the trademark. “It all started by accident, when exchange students and other visitors took the game from Finland back to France with them. Now there’s a big   community.”  is well known enough to have its own annual world championship tournament. Last year, it was organised in Paris, this year in the Czech Republic and next year it’ll take place in Tactic’s hometown Pori, Finland. Still, the game’s popularity is far from its peak: Tactic aims to produce a million   a year as soon as its facilities are updated to the increasing speed of production. “It won’t happen this year or the next, but soon anyway,” Nieminen notes. “We see a huge potential for   in the international market.” On top of this week’s midsummer, Tactic is also celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The company started out in a family garage, and the ownership still remains in the hands of the same family. Some of the games in Tactic’s selection have been available for decades and continue be popular among new generations of growing gamers. Newcomers include a collaboration with the   creator Rovio.   joined the gang in 2010, when Tactic bought the game’s rights from its original manufacturer. Now, producing   is a full-time job for over a dozen people in two shifts. To meet the million-games-a-year target, the factory needs to speed up – but patiently. “We’re not looking for quick wins and flash sales,” Nieminen explains. “We’re already exporting hundreds of thousands of games, and we always build our sales sustainably, together with local partners.” Nieminen believes that  ’s got what it takes to become a global classic. “It’s not high tech yet it’s ecological and somewhat exotic,” he describes. “The materials from pure Finnish nature and a simple approach to spending time outdoors with friends are universally appreciated.” Mölkky suits all ages, shapes, sizes and levels of seriousness. A Finn focusing on mobile games during   would receive a lot of frowns from his or her friends at the summer cottage.   gets people’s eyes off the screens. Nieminen doesn’t see digital games as a threat to traditional board and outdoor games. If anything, they encourage people to play more, whatever the game. “The beauty of games like   is that you need another human being to play with,” Nieminen explains. “The interaction happens   the game, not   it.” However, Tactic is about to bring a digital element to traditional   as well. The company will launch an app through which people can seek other keen players in parks, beaches and other public spaces. The app can also be used to ease the point counting process. Yes, points. Not everyone is interested in keeping track of them, but there tends to be someone in the group who follows the rules to each and every letter. Even this Midsummer, a player or two might lose their temper with others not taking the tournament as seriously. Nieminen emphasises that fun is at the core of  , not winning. “Someone always wins, someone always loses,” he reminds everyone who’s about grab a skittle. “  is a laid-back game. Even in the world championships, some teams show up in funny costumes and turn it into a carnival.” At best,   can be an icebreaker at a cottage party. Knowing Finnish summer, sometimes the biggest skittle could be used to break actual ice on the frozen lake… Mölkky has some famous fans.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tillander-s-diamonds-forever/,Tillander’s diamonds are forever,"Ateliér Torbjörn Tillander serves its customers bespoke beauty, ‘calorie-free sweets’: gemstones, pearls and gold in the form of jewellery that will last generations. Opening her fist,   reveals a handful of beautifully shining diamonds and pearls and lets them drop on the table. Some day, each of them will be set to a ring, a necklace, a bracelet, an earring – whatever its new rightful owner will ask for. That owner is likely to be someone with a chunky wallet. “This one is 3 000 euros,” Tillander says and points at one of the shiny stones. “And this… 25 000 euros.” Tillander is the CEO and designer of  , a family company selling handcrafted bespoken jewellery, gold items and gemstones. The first jewellery company run by a Tillander was founded by her grandfather’s grandfather back in the 1800s in St Petersburg, and now altogether six generations of Tillanders have been involved in the business. Tina (left), Paula and Jenny Tillander The youngest,  , has just finished her gemmology studies in London. For those who don’t know, a gemmologist is qualified to identify and evaluate gems, and gemmology is a branch of mineralogy. Grandmother  , Tina and Jenny all recognise a 300-euro diamond from a 30 000-euro one. They can also tell a natural pearl from a farm-grown cultured pearl just by touching and looking. How? “There’s no one thing that differentiates them,” Tina Tillander says. “With experience, you just learn to spot the smallest of things that give away the truth.” Behind a glass wall from the office lobby, four goldsmiths are working to make people’s jewellery dreams come true. As gems aren’t glued to rings or bracelets, setting them into gold or platinum takes sharp eyes and careful hands. There’s no room for an ‘oops!’ when a gem is worth a new family car – and valuables like this can’t be insured. “Sometimes it happens: a stone just breaks, no matter how careful one is,” Tina Tillander explains. “They’re natural materials, so they can be unpredictable.” Trust is at the core of the business. In purchasing pearls and gems, the Tillanders trust the firms they buy them from. In the making, Tina Tillander knows the goldsmiths do their utmost to deliver her vision. Lastly, the end customer relies on Tillander’s information when it comes to the value and origin of the gem or pearl: an average person wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a 25 000-euro and a 90 000-euro necklace. For some, it makes all the difference. Hence there are customers who save up for years to be able to get a piece designed by Tina Tillander. They’re mostly women – or gift-buying partners. “I always say jewellery is like calorie-free sweets for women,” Tina Tillander notes. No glue, just careful handcraft. The majority of Atelier Torbjörn Tillander’s customers are Finnish and in Finland. However, the word has travelled, and Tina Tillander receives orders from abroad, too. Sometimes she travels overseas to show gems to buyers, but most of the time international designing is done over email. When most pieces are bespoke, there are no collections or catalogues to pick favourites from. Regular customers often leave the creative process fully in Tillander’s hands. “The world moves rapidly, and customers are always seeking something new,” she explains. “I travel a lot in search of new gems and pearls, as the ideas always stem from materials. The process needs a starting point.” There have been talks about setting up a base somewhere like Stockholm or London. The biggest challenge would, according to Tina Tillander, lie in finding goldsmiths that have borderline psychic skills. The Tillander family trusts their goldsmiths more than a mere 100 per cent, and three out of five of them have worked with her for over two decades. “Sometimes I feel like they read my mind!” Tina Tillander says laughingly. “I tell them to ‘make it a little chubbier’ and they know exactly what I mean.” Tina Tillander thinks everyone deserves to sparkle. To make a piece of jewellery personal to its owner, she draws inspiration from things like smiles, gestures and expressions."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/billebeino-passion-fabric/,Billebeino is passion in fabric,"A mysterious hashtag, a simple-but-oh-so-cool logo and a few hundred stickers have played a crucial role in the creation of Finnish fashion brand Billebeino. NHL player   watched his mate   flick through Instagram when the duo was killing time at the airport in Detroit, US. “I’m   a lot. Like,  ,” Putkonen says laughingly. “Then Ville asked me to help him set up an account, as he didn’t have much in the way of digital skills.” Putkonen was happy to help with everything but one thing: Leino had to come up with his username by himself. Being famous, at least in hockey terms, he didn’t want to use his own name. ‘ ’ was born out of one of his nicknames among foreigners, Bille. At first, the photos were Leino’s personal snapshots and the private account was followed by his friends. Now, looking at  , there are over 20 000 followers and both Finnish and international stars wearing clothes with a stripey logo or the word Billebeino on them. What has happened after a hockey man took his tentative first steps on visual social media? The same as Putkonen’s Instagram usage:  . Ville Leino (left) and Juhani Putkonen The Billebeino logo was initially a signature Leino marked his paintings with, and then it became a bit of a thing between the him and Putkonen. The duo printed out several hundred stickers with the logo on and stuck them all over the place, posting photographs of them on social media using the hashtag #billebeino. Some of the stickers were splashed onto clothing. Then the two started to ponder: why not actually   it on a shirt? “I always say that the coolest thing about Billebeino is that we never decided to start a clothing brand, sat down and created a strategy,” Putkonen explains. “It’s been a bunch of accidents, one leading to another.” In the beginning, Billebeino made beanies that were sold to friends. When you’re famous yourself, you tend to know a few other famous people, too. Thus, soon people like   and   were wearing Billebeino under the hashtag  . The frustrating thing for fans was that they couldn’t get their hands on Billebeino. Its origins were a mystery, so too its purpose. The enigma surrounding the brand also suggested a huge trend that was bubbling beneath the surface. This lasted for months. “It was pretty cool,” Putkonen notes. “It was mysterious, so people became keen, as they weren’t sure if it was something they should know about.” When the website opened in 2014, the site crashed under the weight of enthusiasm. Billebeino has created a collection in collaboration with Finnish beverage company Hartwall to celebrate Hartwall’s long drink, which was developed for the Helsinki Olympic Games in 1952. Since then, Billebeino’s selection has grown to comprise all sorts of clothing. Although any regular Joe can purchase the items nowadays, stars haven’t abandoned the brand: musicians as well as sports folks from both Finland and abroad have been seen wearing Billebeino. For example,   from the Nashville Predators recently sailed through a Stanley Cup press day with a Billebeino cap on. Such visibility is the kind that can’t be bought with dollar bills. Despite Leino’s background, Billebeino isn’t just sports. Putkonen emphasises that Billebeino is a lifestyle brand. “We don’t want to be sold in sports stores; our dream is to be in shops like Urban Outfitters.” It’s not just a pipe dream. When Leino is done with professional hockey, the brand will start hitting the prospects in the North American market. Putkonen says that Leino sees Billebeino as his second career. Financially, NHL players don’t really need a dayjob after they take their skates off. “That’s how much passion there is for Billebeino,” Putkonen says. “He wouldn’t need to, but he wants to. Leino’s passion for fashion has made him Billebeino’s head designer. All items are, design-wise, creations of the company’s founding fathers. The production itself is outsourced and happens with the help of fellow Finns,  . Clothing comes from India and is made of 100 per cent recycled materials, and caps are made in Bangladesh. Pure Waste owns the factory in India, monitoring sustainability and workers’ rights closely. “We’re really excited about the ethical aspect,” Putkonen says. “We’re already overconsuming the Earth’s capacity, so it’s nice to be able to do our share to improve that, as well as the wellbeing of the workers.” In Finland, Billebeino is operated by Putkonen plus one staff member, a second one joining in later this year. Leino does what he can, when he’s not on the ice. At the moment, the vast majority of orders comes from Finland. There are upcoming collaborations that are likely to change this, though, but Putkonen remains tight lipped, as contracts are yet to be inked. The product range is growing, too. Billebeino sticks to its guns when it comes to basics and has so far launched its new products as drops instead of collections. The plan is to sell some limited edition items too, such as colours and designs that won’t be restocked. “Our classics won’t go anywhere, but limited editions are a treat to fans and a way to get customers to react,” Putkonen tells. “It’s working: pretty much every launch has crashed the site, not matter how well we’ve thought we’ve prepared. P.K. Subban from the Nashville Predators on a Stanley Cup press day. Yes, it’s Billebeino."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/oviku-unbreakable-offer-home-security/,Oviku has an unbreakable offer for home security,"One easy addition and your door lock becomes pickproof. This is the sales pitch of Finnish startup Oviku and it has proved to be convincing. The frequent flyer status of  has reached new heights since he founded   in October 2013. Taking a moment to sit down in London, where he is scheduled to meet potential Taiwanese partners, a few days later he’ll be on a plane to New York. These meetings are to finalise licensing and distribution agreements for Oviku’s patented innovation: a pickproof outdoor lock. Where this innovation distinguishes itself from the competition is that it can be easily retrofitted to existing locks. Once the mechanism is activated, it becomes impossible to open the lock from the outside. “Other smart locks can be opened if you have the key,” explains Ek. “Where we differ is that when you close the door, our mechanism deactivates the entire key cylinder. I can’t pick the lock open or enter your home even if I have copied, found or stolen your key.” The lock has two versions: manual and smart, the latter of which is controlled via a mobile app. The app can be used to share single use passcodes to open a door and recieve alerts if someone unlocks the door from the inside. For such a secure proposition, the origin of Oviku actually lies in coincidence. In early 2012, Ek was working on a lightweight helmet for figure skaters, when a friend asked about the item that was located next to his laptop. It was a lockable internal door handle developed by Ek’s father,  , a former prison security specialist. Where we differ is that when you close the door, our mechanism deactivates the entire key cylinder. “The friend instantly told me, ‘Throw away the helmet, you are going to make a career out of this’,” Ek recalls. “He introduced me to the Foundation for Finnish Inventions and two weeks later they had granted us their biggest individual funding for an inventor so far, 50 000 euros.” The door handle became the father-son duo’s first patented product and Oviku was officially founded. But the real breakthrough came when the company started to develop the pickproof outdoor lock. Ek went on a market research trip to the US and stopped by the first hardware store he came across to buy a lock. He instantly realised that, unlike Finnish locks, Oviku’s innovation fits standard US locks without modification. “At that one moment our market potential grew from 5.5 million people to 321 million,” Ek says. “Back in Finland we then realised the same US lock-type is also popular in Australia, New Zealand and large parts of Asia.” Some two years of product development later Oviku has a portfolio of five patents (with six more pending), and the smart lock is ready to launch in Canada and the US this autumn followed by Finland and the Baltics in early 2018. Oviku now has a five-person team in Helsinki with a subsidiary in the US, and is on the verge of closing two distribution agreements in North America. Ek describes the US as the world’s biggest market for smart homes, but is also one of the most challenging to crack for a startup. He has learnt this the hard way. Without disclosing details, Ek emphasises it is crucial to double and triple check the background of potential partners and ask for recommendations. “And before you do any of those things, find yourself a good lawyer,” Ek advices. “Startups need to understand there is no point going to the US with the attitude of ‘I know how this is done’.” It has been a valuable lesson, as Oviku is expanding its US operations and eventually hopes to open another subsidiary in Asia. It is a make-or-break year for Ek and his team, with the company aiming to create a whole product line around smart locks. “We already have more products in the pipeline,” Ek teases. “I can’t reveal more, but they are patented products to reshape the security of smart homes.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-friday-wood-construction/,Five for Friday: Wood in construction,"The increased awareness of environmental issues worldwide is enhancing new solutions and accelerating wood-construction markets in Finland. With 65 per cent of the country’s total land area covered in forest, it stands to reason that different wood conversion products have long been a major export for Finland. Recently, wooden structures from design furniture to skyscrapers are being built all over the world, with Finland riding the crest of the wave in this sustainable ligneous trend. Hence, for this Friday, here are five Finnish ways to use timber in construction. Finnish     has been breaking ground with a city structure innovation, Paracity, that helps solve problems related to urban decay and offers a fast solution for reconstruction. “The idea of Paracity is the same as a slum, where the residents quickly claim the available space,” Casagrande  . According to the website, Paracity is a biourban organism that is growing on the principles of Open Form. The growing organism is based on a three-dimensional wooden primary structure, organic grid with spatial six-cubic metre modules. This manufacturer of finger joint and laminated wood components for windows and doors has become a major player in the European window industry, thanks to   and considerable investments in production lines and facilities. According to the company’s website, it strives to increase the window industry’s efficiency and productivity and help respond to the changing requirements related to energy efficiency and structures used in construction. These architects are known for their work designing public buildings and urban planning. K2S embraces the tradition of Finnish architecture that includes wood, light, artisanship and construction detail, all the while blazing a trail. “What makes wood interesting is its versatility,” the firm’s   . “It is an architectural all-rounder, perfect for everything from building frames and facades to interior cladding and furnishings.” A global market leader in both the plywood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) industries, Raute is keeping busy by landing deals in   and  , along with   and innovations. “Smart Scan HD, the next generation log scanning system, is a game-changer in its own right when it comes to raw material savings in the green end, optimising algorithms according to customer needs with shorter peel-to-peel times and less lathe-charging failures,”  , vice president of technology at Raute Finland  . Sustainably aware customers,  , have found their true north in this company’s prefabricated houses. More and more Chinese people are enjoying healthy living in Rovaniemi log houses made in Lapland. “Ecological housing is emerging in China, and high-quality Scandinavian house models are highly coveted,” managing director    ."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/frosmo-streamlines-online-shopping-experiences/,Frosmo streamlines online shopping experiences,"Finnish company Frosmo is at the forefront of two global trends: the digitalisation of retail and simplification of software development. Pivoting, turning your business idea upside down, is not an easy task. Fortunately,  ’s CEO   can now reminiscence about the early days of his company from the comfort of his big and shiny office in the very heart of Helsinki, overlooking the Central Railway Station. Over the past four years, Frosmo has seen its turnover more than double every year. Last year it was 5.5 million euros. “We had a few rough years rebuilding the company,” Gummerus says. “In a situation like that, it can be difficult to convince investors. There have been numerous failures and zero eureka moments, just perseverance and continuous effort.” The situation Gummerus refers to dates back to Frosmo’s birth about 10 years ago. Initially the idea was to sell software to game developers. At the time, Facebook games like   were vastly more popular than they are today. However, few game developers are swimming in extra coin, and Frosmo’s business idea didn’t quite see an avalance of cash flow. The next step was to assure investors that it’d be possible to sell the same software to ecommerce companies. The effort brought results: now the Frosmo team has approximately 90 staff members and is scattered around the world in Helsinki, Sweden, Spain, the UK, Singapore, Poland and Turkey. Frosmo’s team is very multinational and constantly growing. Frosmo’s platform helps ecommerce owners gain speed and cost-efficiency in running their online stores. The solution comprises a Javascript library and a customer-specific configuration file, which are simply loaded in the browser, without the need for changing the already existing customer website. In practice, this means that websites can be personalised to meet a specific customer’s need. It also enables streamlining the purchase process, so that swapping between devices doesn’t mean the user needs to start over again. For example, someone booking a package holiday will receive tailored offers whilst mapping options, and then he or she can begin the reservation on a laptop, continue on a phone and finalise it on a tablet. The solution also leaves a lot of leeway to customise and extend the website quickly and flexibly. This, according to Gummerus, is part of a growing global trend. “Software development is becoming simpler and faster,” he explains. “Instead of heavy and lengthy projects, the focus is on coming up with more efficient and straightforward approaches and browser-based solutions.” The other international wave Frosmo is riding is the digitalisation of retail. As competition tightens and more and more companies go online, Frosmo aims to help its business customers stand out as they serve their human customers better by improving their user experience. What Fromo solution is used for depends on the company’s needs. Some focus on reaching out to new customers, some on increasing the loyalty of existing customer contacts and some on creating  , which means cross-channel marketing and retail. “Usually each company seeks one or two of these things,” Gummerus notes. The largest customer segment is retail, followed by travel, betting and media. The list of references also includes banking and insurance companies. After establishing itself in Finland, Frosmo has opened six offices abroad. International sales are constantly growing, already taking up two thirds of the total. New countries are being sought all the time – but only with the right people. “We always begin sales from Finland,” Gummerus tells. “We don’t do extensive market research, but we employ a lot of foreigners who have moved here. Then, once we find the right people, they can go to the target market and set up our office there.” All European countries are of Frosmo’s interest, so here’s a heads-up to everyone looking for job prospects: “Our aim is to hire at least a few new people every month. The need for good developers and sales professionals is dire all around the world, and we’re no different.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ficonic-solutions-focussed-road/,Ficonic Solutions is focused on the road,"Despite rules and regulations, people continue to use smartphones while driving. Finnish software developer Ficonic Solutions has the solution: in-vehicle application Carrio, which drastically reduces driver distraction. If sitting is the new smoking, then being sat behind the wheel can be extra hazardous. Research shows that visual distraction, where the driver’s eyes are not on the road, plays a part in the vast majority of rear-end collisions. Nevertheless, more than four out of five drivers admit that they use their phone whilst driving. In an effort to curb this problem,   has developed an easy-to-use service known as   that reduces distraction by up to 60 per cent. “When it comes to road safety, we have a different approach,” explains CEO  . “As people continue to use their smartphones regardless of bans and campaigns, Carrio is designed to be used behind the wheel. With a user interface combined with speech and handwriting, our solution is proven to be significantly safer compared to mobile apps.” What Carrio does is that it integrates all the information, content and functions one uses during the trip into one app. It’s an infotainment solution available for the Android operating system, thus it can be used in every vehicle, not just in a new and shiny cars with advanced on-board computers. “The service reads, for instance, emails and WhatsApp messages out loud and news feeds can be skimmed with voice control,” Salminen demonstrates. This way, the driver can remain focused on the road and the urge to constantly check the phone is reduced. Carrio optimises smartphone usage while driving, with such features as voice control. “Everything you need while driving is just swipes away and allows the driver keep the eyes on the road,” Salminen says. Ficonic Solutions and especially its Carrio solution have received remarkable attention and success over the couple few months. Carrio has already been launched in 13 countries this past year. It was nominated in the Newcomer of the Year category at the TU Automotive Awards in the US, and just recently Carrio came second at the Car HMi Awards in Berlin for the Most User-Friendly HMI Feature. The nominations and attention achieved haven’t been earned overnight. The development of Carrio is an on-going process, and it is constantly being upgraded with new features. “We continue developing Carrio via partnerships,” Salminen explains. “Even now, there are collaborations, for example, with Here navigation system and podcast and online radio providers. Just recently we started a telematics cooperation, which allows Carrio to utilise vehicle data better.” Users may import their favourite content into Carrio. Hence, development of the device is contingent on the eager customer base, whose feedback is essential for enhanced user orientation. “At the moment we are improving a feature that eases reading and sending emails while driving,” Salminen explains. Ficonic Solutions was found after software professionals from mobile and car industries joined forces, and a private equity investor became excited about the idea of Carrio. The company is now in a middle of its third accounting period and employs 10 encoders, some of which are also in charge of running the business and marketing. In the last year, its business was already profitable, while the growth was 400 per cent. “Ficonic Solutions has a two-way revenue,” tells Salminen. “While Carrio is the main product, the company also creates software development and tailored IoT solutions for customers such as Pioneer. In spite of it still being a novel start-up with limited resources, Ficonic Solutions has already made people to enjoy their time in traffic more. “My desire is that in the near future Carrio will be a solution for a safer world, where up to 10 per cent of all drivers worldwide will be using it, which means potentially 100 million drivers,” Salminen reveals. In short, where rubber meets the road, Ficonic Solutions has what it takes to transform the wasted hours spent motoring into quality time, everywhere, safe and sound."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/egg-rethinks-fast-food-farming-furniture/,EGG rethinks fast food from farming to furniture,"Finnish ’reggstaurant’ EGG doesn’t cut corners when it creates its seasonal, egg-based menus. Soon it’ll be testing its concept abroad, together with Finnish accommodation service Forenom. Two years ago, after hitting the gym,   searched for food with his friend in a Finnish shopping mall. As nothing else was open, they nipped into a multinational fast-food restaurant. When they got their trays, Karjula couldn’t help but wonder why there’s a constant queue for food he deemed expensive and of poor quality. Whilst eating their not-so-appetising meals, the duo started thinking about ways to renew the existing fast-food culture. EGG co-founder Samuli Karjula “We thought about egg as an ingredient,” Karjula says. “Its carbon footprint is far smaller than that of pork and it’s easy to adjust according to the season. In traditional fast food restaurants, you get the same thing every time, regardless of the price and availability of the ingredients.” Later Karjula, already having experience from a food-related startup, happened to come across Finnish chef  , who was looking for a restaurant space in Helsinki. Karjula got in touch and told the Michelin-starred cook that he had no insight as to locations, but instead, he had an idea. Toivanen got on board, as did 11 other people in the end. They rethought the whole concept of a restaurant by dividing it into segments and finding the best possible people to take the lead of each of them, such as food, graphic design and human resources. This team effort led to  : a restaurant where the food is fast, but made of high-quality, fresh and local ingredients. “Eating fast food can make one feel a little guilty and dirty,” Karjula notes. “We wanted to show that it can be done much better, no guilt attached.” EGG’s core lies in the ingredients. The dishes are always based on free range eggs, coming from a partner farm with very different conditions to those of industrialised egg production. Those seeking veggie options, can opt for vegan ‘egg’ made using EGG’s own recipe. The fillings change every two months. EGG always goes for what’s at its freshest and most delicious there and then, and each product is well thought through. “Sometimes people compare the price of the cheapest eggs in supermarkets to our lunches and wonder where the price tag comes from,” Karjula tells. “However, when you look at the ingredients, like smoked vendace or malt pork, they really are that valuable. Karjula emphasises that EGG doesn’t want to be “a restaurant for hippies”. What they do want is to have everything so well thought through that the customers can enjoy their meals with zero worries in mind. “We’ve thought about everything, so our customers don’t need to think at all.” This doesn’t only apply to what’s on the plates; everything in the restaurant is designed to reflect the company’s values. Furniture comes from a Finnish  , lamps from   and smoke alarms from  . “Often things can be branded ‘Finnish’ or ‘Nordic’, but without consistency,” Karjula says. “We’ve taken every detail into account.” At the moment, the only ‘reggstaurant’ is located in the touristy area of Kanavaranta in central Helsinki. Next year there’ll be a branch in Jyväskylä, and even sooner there’ll be EGG-branded products available in Finnish supermarkets. Currently the only EGG restaurant is located in Helsinki. The first real step of EGG’s international conquest will be taken next year in Stockholm. EGG has teamed up with Finnish business accommodation service  , and its Stockholm restaurant will be located within Forenom’s Aparthotels. “Scouting for locations isn’t our core business,” Karjula explains. “This way, we never have to worry about premises, as that’s part of Forenom’s expertise, and we can focus on what we do best.” There are plans to set up an EGG in Forenom’s Aparthotels in other Nordic capitals and cities, including in Finland. This brings customer flow to EGG and choice to Forenom’s guests. The EGG team will make us of the concept in its other project, too. In August, it will open a wild food restaurant in Helsinki in conjunction with design store  . The duo also plans to travel abroad together. “I’m sure the concept would work on its own, too,” Karjula says. “We just think it makes the most sense to look for collaborators.” In general, Karjula encourages all entrepreneurs to forget about traditional borders between fields of business. “Putting two things together is a win-win for both. Why does an opera house need to have a terrible restaurant, when there could be an excellent one – and that would introduce opera fans to food and food lovers to opera?”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-for-friday-finnish-beer-flavours/,Five for Friday: Finnish beer flavours,"Craft Beer Helsinki, a festival for beer enthusiasts, introduces Finnish microbreweries and their products to the general public this week. We took a sip of the abundant selection. It is all beer and skittles in central Helsinki this weekend, as   festival uncorks the fascinating world of locally brewed beer from near and far. There are 15 Finnish craft breweries, along with international ones, serving their goodies. Our staff pounded some beers and came by intriguing pieces from the prospering Finnish craft beer scene. The traditional (and strong!) Finnish   is a rarity even in the domestic market. Maku Brewing, set up in 2014, is one of the honourable few producing it. “  has kept its mysterious character, because it is difficult to brew,” CEO   explains. “The traditional method and ingredients are so demanding that most breweries are not willing to take the steps needed. We wanted to try our wings, make authentic   and sustain the rich Finnish beer heritage.” Cracking open a cold one is this brewery’s business, and business is good. After being awarded a gold medal   and another  , these folks reach for the sky with their novel recipes. “We have a new formula for upcoming competitions; we use   to brew imperial stout that has been matured in Bourbon barrels,” administrative director   reveals. Vallilan panimo is a harbinger when it comes to hemp beer. One could say they have launched a completely new style of beer with their brand Orion, a pale ale flavoured with hemp leaves and seeds. “We ran into a Finnish hemp fibre producer, who was willing to provide us with fresh domestic Finola hemp,” partner   says. “Everything came together pretty easily, and we are really pleased with the result.” Not only beer, but also craft cider may be at the summit of the success of Malmgård Brewery. There are plenty of interesting cider flavours to discover at the beer festival as well. “We mainly use ingredients that have been grown in the surroundings of Malmgård’s own mansion,” tells  , sales and marketing director. “The ingredients we use in our beers and ciders, such as spelt and juniper, are truly locally grown.” Fat Lizard Brewing is an indie brewery with a funky name, the etymology of which  . It specialises in extremely fresh and drinkable beers. “All the beer we brew is vegan, whereas surprisingly many breweries use additives of animal origin,” brewer  explains. “We supply everything we produce directly to our clients to ensure our beer remains fresh once served.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-design-project-to-tackle-youth-homelessness/,Finnish design project to tackle youth homelessness,"Could design solve a societal problem? Many countries are grappling with youth homelessness while cities are full of empty, habitable spaces. A Finnish design project is joining the dots of this dilemma. A Helsinki-based youth community home closed its doors a few years ago but it was soon transformed into apartments for young people. In turn, a 100-year-old villa on the island of Vartiosaari in Helsinki housed young people over the summer and a retirement home’s residents had company from young flatmates. The City of Helsinki Youth Department’s “A Home That Fits” project uses existing spaces and buildings that may not immediately come to mind when dealing with youth homelessness, for housing. An even greater idea exists in the background: what if the methods of design could be used to solve a large, structural societal problem? The issue of youth homelessness can be understood in more detail with the help of different trials. Instead of waiting for the one perfect solution to arise, design makes it possible to quickly try out different options. Several countries are dealing with youth homelessness. Could Finland set an example with this experimental problem-solving model? The project, which began in spring 2015, includes a project team that seeks empty habitable spaces and a designer,  , who helps to transform the spaces into functional communities. Shipping container homes are a good example of turning unusual spaces into habitable flats. Obviously no one wants to live in a container for a long time but for a student who has just moved into a town, a few months of affordable container living helps to save up a deposit for a long-term apartment. The pilot group for Vartiosaari’s trial living was compiled from construction students, who lived on the island for the summer and renovated an old villa and its environment at the same time. Several locations, such as youth community homes, do not really need physical revamping. This means the designer can focus on people and opportunities instead of walls. “Designers are used to wild thinking and aren’t shackled to certain formulas,” says  , project manager at the Youth Department. “Personally, it is often too easy to just fall into thinking about constraints.” The most important aspect of the project is the cooperation between the young people and organisers. The youth is closely involved in the planning process with the designer and the Youth Department, who come up together the ground rules for living. In turn, Riquelme’s task is to make sure that the trials, that provide valuable information what works and what doesn’t, move forward. In the best-case scenario, several problems are solved at once: a young person gets an apartment, empty space is put into use, and the young people get to use their know-how in developing new homes. The pilot group for Vartiosaari’s trial living was compiled from construction students, who lived on the island for the summer and renovated the old villa and its environment at the same time. More than enough partner organisations have signed up for the project and the pilot trials are now meant to be cultivated into continuous practices, which will provide permanent solutions to the Finland’s metropolitan area’s youth homelessness. The project has strengthened the belief that young people want to – and can be – involved in decision making. Several young people have expressed their desire to come and help, not because homelessness personally concerns them at the moment, but because they know someone whose situation is not as good as their own. The project wants to emphasise that young people should be trusted; as Vartiosaari’s old, but now renovated, villa demonstrates. “It is easily thought of young people that you can’t let them here, they will destroy this place,” Riquelme says. “We want to show that the opposite is true: young people are needed to hold this place together.”"

Finnish startup Primesmith makes both possible. “Our competitive advantage comes from high technology, not from cheap labour,” says CEO Henri Nyström. “It is important for us to not produce any unwanted products into this world, instead every single piece of jewellery we make has been ordered by a customer,” says founder Kristian Saarikorpi."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/moni-revolutionises-mobile-consumer-finance/,Moni revolutionises mobile consumer finance,"Finnish startup Moni has created an innovative service so people can manage their finances on mobile devices. For years we have been promised that we would soon be able to handle our finances on our phones, from payments to loans, from invoices to transaction records. Finally that vision is becoming reality thanks to  . “I already had many ideas for online services at the end of the 1990s, but online payments were always the problem,” says  , Moni CEO and founder. “More recently I was frustrated with banks, especially their online user experience. It was really difficult to handle your personal finances, there were no digital receipts, paper invoices were mailed to your home, and there were many different apps for handling one specific task.” Moni was founded in 2014 with the idea of taking a 21st Century approach to consumer finance, and now their platform is near fruition. It allows a user to make payments, send and receive money, and link a debit or credit card to a Moni account. Even salaries can be deposited to a user’s account, which they can access via a prepaid Mastercard. A particularly novel approach is for credit: a user can apply for credit from banks or other professional lenders via a real-time auction, but they can also use the peer-to-peer system. This arrangement allows a user to borrow money from or lend money to different individuals in their network. Moni has run a unique pilot programme with the Finnish Immigration Service Migri: refugees with no passports have been able to open Moni accounts and use prepaid cards to make purchases in Finland. Over the winter the company ran a unique pilot programme with the Finnish Immigration Service Migri. The Finnish state paid regular government benefits to almost 4 000 refugees with Moni accounts. They could then use prepaid cards to make purchases in Finland. “As the refugees cannot get a bank account in Finland, the second experiment was to pay salaries to Moni accounts for refugees who have obtained permission to work,” Pennanen says. Refugees with no passports may not be able to open accounts at regular banks due to their strict know-your-customer rules, but Migri has an identification system which can be used with Moni. Now refugees can better participate in Finnish society. “So far all the concerned parties – Migri, the reception centres and the refugees – have been satisfied with Moni,” Pennanen continues. This is not simply a mobile application they are building. Instead, they want to create a hub and ecosystem, such as the App Store and its developers, which enables third parties to innovate services for the consumers. These could be things such as loyal shopper programs or insurance services. Pennanen explains that a user would be able to choose what services he wants, just like picking which cards to carry in a physical wallet. Now Moni is testing their full consumer product. After testing they will roll out a full public launch in Finland, and soon after they plan to expand into other European countries as soon as regulatory licenses are in place. “Our big vision is that our technology makes it possible to have a ‘banking’ account on any mobile phone for any person on the planet,” Pennanen concludes. “We are happy to see how many investors and collaborators share our vision and are helping us to reach our goals.” Moni’s platform allows users to make payments, send and receive money, and link a debit or credit card to a Moni account."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/curious-ai-turns-machines-into-autonomous-learners/,Curious AI turns machines into autonomous learners,"The opportunities artificial intelligence (AI) brings us are still partially wild visions of the future. One of the companies knocking on the doors of this new kind of world is Finland’s The Curious AI Company, which aims at turning machines into human-like autonomous learners. Driverless cars, machines that recognise cancer cells, or news-writing robots are no longer mere science fiction. CEO   from   deems it realistic to say that some of the tasks that now require human labour will be performed by artificial intelligence within five years. “AI has led a lot of great results already. For example, for many of us a smartphone is like a personal secretary,” Valpola says. Investors, too, see AI as a part of our future. Upon its founding, Curious AI collected 800 000 euros from Finnish Lifeline Ventures, British Balderton Capital and US-based Invus. The seed funding gave the company’s founders an opportunity to leave their previous jobs and focus on Curious AI Company. According to Valpola, the funding will take them to the end of 2016 at the company’s current growth pace. Finding new funding shouldn’t be a mission impossible though. “The industry is booming, and there’s a lot of money in it.” Right now investors don’t even expect AI-related companies to immediately seek profit. For example, Curious AI Company is not yet producing sellable products or services; instead, it does research on algorithms that can be used in developing them. “We are in the centre of the development of AI,” says Harri Valpola. Curious AI Company was only founded a few months ago. Its makers have, however, a long and diverse experience, which Valpola believes to be one of the things that convinced investors. Also, Curious AI’s approach is exceptional. Many of today’s AI applications have been built on a method called supervised deep learning, which means that an enormous amount of data is fed into the computer, categorised, and labelled. ”A human tells the machine what a letter, a word, or a photo means. Teaching the machine step by step is slow and costly.” Curious AI looks even deeper. “We humans learn mainly unsupervised, through playing outside or during interaction with others. Even in formal teaching situations we learn to understand teaching signals, which, in machine learning terms, is still unsupervised. Our company has reached a breakthrough in a semi-supervised learning technology that resembles human learning.” The semi-supervised method means that the machine starts to differentiate and analyse data similarly to how humans begin to apply their knowledge in new situations. This way the machine does not only recognise, but also understands content. Valpola points out that when machines start to comprehend text, images, and speech in a human-like way, a lot of things will change radically. “We will still need people to make decisions and be responsible for them. With AI, we are all bosses and our teams are AI algorithms, which can increase productivity remarkably.” Sometimes automatization is criticised for making human interaction and face-to-face encounters obsolete. Valpola says that one of the challenges of AI is to bring it from the hands of the few to benefit all ranges of society. He sees Finland as an excellent starting point. “In Finland everyone is looked after. The fact that a machine deals with the majority of work does not need to mean people end up jobless on the streets. Instead they can spend more time with their families, for example.” In the near future, Curious AI is looking at machines that can understand images and sounds almost like humans. The long-term plan is to expand to cognitions and symbolic reasoning; in other words, to make systems learn independently and function autonomously. Because Curious AI aims at providing machines with human skills, the team includes neuroscientists. Valpola’s own research background is in machine learning, robotics, and neuroscience. In addition to his academic experience, he is one of the founders and the previous head of research in Zenrobotics, a company that uses machine learning and robotics in waste recycling. The Helsinki-based Curious AI Company employs just under a dozen people. New experts are sought after all the time, and Valpola believes the research team will eventually double. He has been happy to see how Helsinki has grown into an internationally important hub for startups. With the experience in both AI and neuroscience Helsinki can offer, the company’s future looks promising. “Helsinki has a long history in machine learning, enthusiastic and educated people, and both research and companies. We are in the centre of the development of AI.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/runteq-gives-sports-apps-a-run-for-their-money/,Runteq gives sports apps a run for their money,"It’s no stretch to say that the market has been saturated with similar devices that track and monitor your sporting progress. Breaking away from the pack, Zoi brings your coach along with you. Like many bidding farewell to their youth, a handful of years ago engineer  came to realise he had grown a little wider around the midsection. But, rather than perpetuate the problem by remaining idle, he decided it was time to go out and pound the pavement. Jogging became something Ojala enjoyed immensely, his improved energy levels coinciding with the excess weight he quickly shed. However, there was one downside to this new pursuit: various niggling injuries. Nonetheless, he accepted these as coming with the territory. If he was committed to racking up the miles every week, it was inevitable that he would encounter a few aches and pains along the way. It was only after a visit to his local sportswear store that he came to realise he was contributing to his own discomfort. “The person selling running shoes told me that the problem with my running was my gait,” he recalls. “My feet weren’t aligned with my movement.” Such an objective opinion resonated with him. Like many, he hadn’t taken any running classes, or consulted with a professional before setting off on his new hobby. What more could there to it be other than moving his left foot forward, followed by his right and then rapidly repeating this formula until he was out of breath? Quite a lot, he was to discover. The Runteq team (left to right): Lead software developer Aku Virtanen, CTO Juho Blankenstein and CEO and founder Tommi Ojala. The more Ojala researched, the more apparent the importance of employing a correct running technique became. Being an engineer by trade, he sought out technology that could assist him, but came up empty handed. Aside from hiring the services of a personal trainer, there was no portable measurement system available that helped people to assess their technique. Yet, after working at Nokia for 15 years, he understood the technical requirements needed to create a device that could do this. This meeting place of personal experience and professional curiosity became the foundations for  . Ojala promptly packed up his desk and founded the company, registering Runteq at the beginning of 2012. A handful of years later, its first product, Zoi, is about to enter the market. “It’s a coaching application, combined with a wearable sensor that can help you to run faster, smarter and prevent injury,” Ojala explains. “It helps you to enjoy running more.” Sensors are placed on the runner’s shoelaces and to their chest strap, which collect data accessible via the Zoi app. Issues such as heel-striking, overstriding, stride length and balance are all recorded and reported in real time via live feedback. After raising well over 300 000 euros in capital from private individuals and Finnish innovation funding agency Tekes, Runteq has set its sights on attracting a bigger investor. Zoi is set to roll out by the end of the year, with preorders already coming in from around the world. While running is Runteq’s initial focus, other sports will be taken into consideration in future. In spite of the improvement possibilities that Zoi offers, Ojala emphasises that at the end of the day it’s up to the individual whether they take heed of the suggestions. “People have to be interested in changing their gait,” he explains. “This system does not do anything automatically. The change has to be made in your mind and the way you do sports.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/m-room-hits-the-global-hair-business/,M Room hits the global hair business,"Being the biggest in Finland doesn’t quite cut it for barbershop chain M Room: its aim is to be the biggest on the planet. Now it has shops in Europe and the US, and new doors are knocked on all the time. A decade ago all barbershops were so similar to each other that it started to bore   and  . The two men were travelling around the world competing in hairdressing and started pondering over ideas as to how to disrupt the industry. ”Petri was longing for the old times’ style barbershops, the kind his grandmother used to run. I’m more business-oriented, so I wondered how to the change the whole concept,” Kylätasku says. Thoughts were coming and going, and the focus was on the potential of men as a customer group. The first time there was an opportunity to actually follow through with the idea came about when both Kylätasku and Sipiläinen were on a lengthy sick leave. Now Kylätasku is the CEO of M Company, which own the largest barbershop chain in Finland called  , and Sipiläinen is its chairman. The core idea lies in membership, which is offered on three levels. All include unlimited visits, but extra euros bring extra benefits such as getting past queues, which can exist: there’s no reservation system, and according to Kylätasku there never will be. ”For a woman a trip to a hairdresser’s can be the highlight of the month and a moment for herself when she has a special coffee and reads women’s magazines. A lot of men want to pop into the barbershop when they happen to have a spare moment.” Almost 40 per cent of M Room’s customers have a membership. According to Kylätasku, not all members are those who are looking for something quick and convenient. “We’re constantly on the lookout for new country partners. From the word go we’ve wanted to go not only national, but also international,” says Toni Kylätasku, CEO of M Company. ”Our barbers are extremely professional. When the staff focuses on a narrow sector, in our case in men’s hair and beards, and they don’t do perms and hair extensions in between, their skills develop inevitably.” So in addition to the ones searching for fast and easy, M Room attracts those who look after themselves more than the average man. ”A monthly fee makes us a sensible choice financially, too. It’s possible to visit us every two weeks and be in shape all the time,” Kylätasku describes. Handcraft aside, M Room’s strength is a Finnish line of products. All shops use M Room’s own selection beginning from hair dyes, and for the Christmas season the company will release a range of men’s cosmetics. Kylätasku says they’re looking into expanding the selection of services further. “Taking care of hands and nails, and grooming in general, are becoming increasingly popular. There’s plenty more things we can do.” Kylätasku and Sipiläinen opened the first M Room in Tampere in 2008. At the time Kylätasku had two barbershops and Sipiläinen had four, and they owned a hairdressing school together. In the beginning the concept was a test, and the owners didn’t receive any salary out of M Company for the first couple of years. Kylätasku points out that all profits went directly into R&D. Development came at speed: according to Kylätasku, the chain is now the biggest in the country, no matter how you measure it. It has 50 shops in Finland, two in Germany and one each in Spain, the US and Estonia. All are taken care of by franchisees. The amount of owners has tripled from two to six, and the German subsidiary is called M Room Germany. 10–15 new shops are opened annually, and each one means four to five new employees. The total number of employees is now around 300. The next steps of conquering the world are taken in Sweden and Morocco, both of which will see their own branch opened before the end of the year. Poland and Luxembourg are on the list, too, and a contract has been signed in the UK. “We’re constantly on the lookout for new country partners. From the word go we’ve wanted to go not only national, but also international,” Kylätasku says. The goal has remained the same: M Room will be the biggest in the world. No date has been set in stone as of yet, Kylätasku adds laughingly. ”I believe that in a few years’ time we’ll be bigger in North America than we are in Europe. The experiences we have from there so far are very encouraging, and although there’s more of both supply and demand over there in comparison to here, both business and the financial market are more developed as well.” The next steps of conquering the world are taken in Sweden and Morocco, both of which will see their own branch opened before the end of the year.   Text: Anne Salomäki"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/chinese-tourists-to-tee-off-in-finland/,Chinese tourists to tee off in Finland,"With an abundance of fresh air, pleasant weather and world-class courses, Finland is a prime location for Chinese tourists looking to play a round of golf. Recent years have seen golf become synonymous with the modern lifestyle of China’s  . Hundreds of golf courses have sprung up around the country to meet demand, with Chinese players also travelling around the world to enjoy their pastime, combining golf trips with family holidays. With airlines such as Finnair offering the shortest direct flights from China to Europe, Finland now finds itself strategically positioned. “Finland is a perfect place to play golf in the summer time,” states  director of  ’s media and public relations. “Conditions are great. It’s not too hot, there is blue sky and the sun is shining.” A group of 15 influential Chinese tourism professionals recently enjoyed 18 holes at Linna Golf, during a promotional trip that took in many different Finnish sights and regions. Finnish Moomin character Little My got on board as well. Designed by   – of renowned golf course architects Thomson Perrett & Lobb – Linna Golf opened for play in 2006. Located on the outskirts of Hämeenlinna, the esteemed course was chosen as Finland’s best at the 2014 World Golf Awards. The centrepiece among the picturesque surroundings of birch and pine forest is Vanajanlinna Castle, with the historic building now converted into a hotel. The beautiful 25C degree-day that greeted the visiting Chinese delegates was perfect playing weather. Compared to the stifling summer heat found back home, as well as in other European countries such as Spain or Portugal, the conditions offered guests a welcome reprieve. “It’s totally different to play golf in Finland than China,” observed , vice president of Pheonox Travel Worldwide. “Especially during summertime, in China it’s so hot. A lot of people are interested in Finland, and it is possible to come here with family.” The Chinese guests also got to know a number of other attractions that differentiate Finland from its neighbouring countries, such as the novelty of playing 18 holes of midnight golf at the Arctic Circle. Other activities such as fishing and rally car driving were also enjoyed during their week-long visit, along with a side trip to Tallinn – all of which can be easily added to itineraries. Both Finnair and Visit Finland hope that this showcase will encourage the visiting travel representatives to develop golf tours as a product that is promoted by their respective companies in China. “Tourism is three to four per cent of the GDP in Finland, which is more than agriculture, for example,” explains  , Finnair’s vice president of sales. “The meaning of tourism is not well known in Finland. We are trying to improve that image in this country and also for those coming here.” Chatting to the various Chinese travel professionals at Linna Golf, it is abundantly clear that golf tourism in Finland could very well be the Next Big Thing. “Finland is a very, very great destination for a golfer,” stated  , publisher of Golf Travel Magazine. “It is beautiful, clean, pure. But many golfers in China are not aware about golf in Finland.” So, what will Mr Li tell them about Finland when he returns to Beijing? “It’s beautiful, you should go there to play golf.” Recent years have seen golf become synonymous with the modern lifestyle of China’s nouveau riche."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wirepas-builds-innovative-iot-networks/,Wirepas builds innovative IoT networks,"The Internet of Things is still in its infancy, but the Finnish company Wirepas has made an evolutionary leap forward with its solution. Early this spring millions of disappointed Englishmen caused a strange phenomenon in the national power grid. They went outside to see the solar eclipse but were stymied by Britain’s ubiquitous clouds. The only thing to do, of course, was to go console themselves with a nice cup of tea. All those kettles warming caused one of the largest power surges of the decade. The use of energy is characterised by such peaks and troughs, and power companies have to estimate changes in demand. It is difficult to store electricity so they instead produce it when it is needed. Luckily their job is made easier because of new smart meters, and the Finnish company Wirepas is making them much more efficient.  is in the Internet of Things (IoT) business, where devices are embedded with sensors and connected into large networks. Wirepas has developed a communication protocol that allows IoT networks with no infrastructure and configuration – instead, the devices themselves form the network. One of the hottest markets in IoT is currently power grids, but the Finnish company sees many other opportunities. “It is clear that we need to progress in the USA, which is not only one of the biggest markets but also the place where new technologies will get global attention and recognition,” says Wirepas CEO Teppo Hemiä. “The strongest segment for us now is smart metering, like electricity, water, gas and environmental meters,” says CEO  . “We expect future growth also from lighting, commercial building automation, hospital healthcare and smart cities: anywhere where large systems are required.” The benefits of these systems come down to more reliable information delivered quicker. Power companies can use this information to eliminate manual meter reading or estimated billing. They can balance electric loads and even use dynamic pricing, where power is cheaper when there is less demand. Ultimately, this makes for a more efficient use of energy. Wirepas is seeing strong demand for their services. Their main product Pino was announced in October 2014 and already powers approximately 1.3 million devices. The firm works with global companies from their base in Tampere, but currently their main markets have been Finland and South Korea. In addition to South Korea, the company established its presence internationally in the US and central Europe during the past summer. “It is clear that we need to progress in the USA, which is not only one of the biggest markets but also the place where new technologies will get global attention and recognition.” Hemiä ticks off a variety of reasons why he thinks Wirepas will get recognition in these new markets: scalability, ease of use and energy efficiency. He also says that the IoT radio environment is becoming crowded, but that Pino offers resilience against radio interference and spectrum efficiency. “The IoT has been on the top of the hype curve for a while, but now we are seeing very fast adoption in several segments,” he says. “The IoT is not lacking concrete ideas anymore and the companies leading in IoT implementation will learn the fastest and have competitive advantage over the others. It is important to start, even if the plan is not complete as the IoT is about building a process and tools to learn further.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/knomi-makes-shopping-more-about-people-less-about-products/,"Knomi makes shopping more about people, less about products","Click! It’s not uncommon these days to hear the sound of a mobile phone camera from behind the curtain of a fitting room: customers want to share their potential purchases with friends before the final decision. Knomi, a fashion application developed in Finland, brings social into shopping both on your mobile and in real-life fashion boutiques. , one of the two co-founders of  , pronounces Knomi “know me”. This shines a light on its core purpose: know me, and know what I want. “We describe Knomi as a combination of Pinterest and Foursquare for high-end fashion. Normally online and offline shopping are experienced as two separate things, but Knomi brings them together,” Ehrnrooth says. Through the application, Knomi users can share and recommend products and brands among their friends and get ideas from inspiring people, such as fashion bloggers. The application then gives the opportunity to order the product from an online store – or the directions to the nearest boutique selling it. This serves both buyers and sellers. Customers can find interesting products with the help of their friends and fashion icons, and boutiques get their doors moving. “For a high-end boutique, the most difficult thing is to find a stream of customers, when discount coupons and Christmas sales don’t fit the bill. Knomi helps customers find the shops, not the other way around,” Ehrnrooth says. This highlights the social aspect of shopping. According to Ehrnrooth, Knomi focuses on the customer instead of the product. “Generally marketing is about the product, not the person. However, people tend to pay more attention to other people and their opinions.” In Finland it’s common to be afraid of failing. The way I see it is that if you never fail, it only means you never really tried. Knomi has been changing shape throughout its development process. Initially Ehrnrooth and his co-founder,   from Germany, created a service aimed at personalising customer service in high-end retail. When a registered customer walks into a boutique with a mobile phone, the salesperson will see his or her details on a tablet, which makes it easy to customise customer service to suit each individual’s needs. Business wasn’t blooming. Just over a year ago the Knomi team decided the concept needs changing. That’s when Knomi, as we now know it, was born. So far the application is only available for Apple’s iOS users. An Android version might come out next year. As the product was only launched very recently, its development is still at full steam. “Now we’re constantly learning from our customer feedback, and the service is improving all the time. I can’t say we were particularly proud of the very first version, but I do think it was a damn good start,” Ehrnrooth says and lets out a laugh. For a regular shopper, using Knomi is free. Its advertising strategy doesn’t rely on traditional yellow pages thinking; rather, companies only pay for results. If Knomi can prove that it contributed to the purchase decision, it receives a commission. Knomi uses mobile positioning technology to show a Knomi member has popped into the shop, but it does so without specifying the users so that their tracking remains anonymous. For a regular shopper, using Knomi is free. Its advertising strategy doesn’t rely on traditional yellow pages thinking; rather, companies only pay for results. Both Ehrnrooth and Zappel live in London, UK, which is where the sales and marketing efforts are targeted, too. However, the company is registered in Finland, and all development is carried out in Knomi’s Helsinki office. Ehrnrooth points out that in Finland there are plenty of skilled software developers – and, in comparison to London, less competition of them. The Finnish high-end fashion market, in turn, is far too petite for someone like Knomi. The office has a map of London on the wall, onto which needles are pinned to mark new partners all over the city. “In order to make the offline aspect of Knomi interesting for its users, there must be a shop within a walking distance anywhere they go in the city. As long as there are holes representing more than a 10-minute walk in London, we keep our focus on filling them.” In addition to about ten employees, Knomi receives help from dozens fashion bloggers and the students of London College of Fashion. The company is constantly on the lookout for talented developers to join their Helsinki team, and similarly London has its eyes on marketing and sales professionals. Once the map of London is covered, the global fashion route is pretty straightforward; Paris, Milan, New York, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Ehrnrooth is fully aware of how much hard work it takes to establish a position in the fashion circles of a city like New York. “If even one other company can make it, so can we. In Finland it’s common to be afraid of failing. The way I see it is that if you never fail, it only means you never really tried.”"

At home it’s easier, but cold contacts can be difficult to come across.” Meshly brings a networking tool into pockets – or wherever one chooses to keep their phone. From the word go the idea was to approach the service from a mobile perspective in order to make it compatible with a travelling lifestyle. The main principle is to bring people together with each other and opportunities alike. Although the idea stems from the entrepreneurs’ own needs, others believe in it, too. After last year’s startup conference Slush Meshly collected over 150 000 euros from angel investors. Downloading and using the application is free of charge. The profits will eventually be gained through offering a premium level service for a fee. “Meshly is by no means just for freelancers, but for everyone, who deems business networking important and who use digital services in their work,” says Meshly CEO Niko Porkka. On Meshly, a profile can be created through already existing profiles on Facebook or Linkedin. A registered user gets access to three features: People, Opportunities, and Events. People lets the user see other active users nearby, and on Opportunities a professional can both offer and ask for services. “Say a freelancer is free for commissions, they can be found and booked directly on Meshly,” Porkka explains. Events lists interesting events taking place in the area and a list of users who’ll be attending. Other features are currently in the making. One will help users find good working spaces in a new city. The feature is called Places, and it’s meant to help those who, for example, have time between meetings and want to spend time in a quiet café with a decent wifi connection. Money won’t get a coffee shop onto Meshly. Porkka says that the listed places are found through the Meshly community, so the feature isn’t commercial. Users themselves choose whether or not the location is suitable. The top priority is to move along with people. “Meshly is by no means just for freelancers, but for everyone, who deems business networking important and who use digital services in their work.” Meshly’s core team consists of Porkka, a head of technology, and head of finance. Under their supervision, there’s an eight-member team based in Ukraine, where the team will shortly grow with a few new members. From the first steps Meshly’s eye has been on the whole world. Already more than a half of the users are from outside of Finland. According to Porkka, Meshly has users in the United States, in big cities in Europe, and some in Asia. Downloading and using the application is free of charge. The profits will eventually be gained through offering a premium level service for a fee. “A wide range of users is a good starting point for an international community,” he says. Being Finnish is, in Porkka’s opinion, important. Finnish innovations are associated with good quality and high level of expertise in technology. Finland is also deemed a good and stable environment for startups to grow in. “At the same time we obviously need to be considered international. As a market area Finland’s so small that we need to be able to get out.” Now the focus is on the business hubs of Europe. It’s essential to gain a wide base of users. “Big markets are naturally intriguing. We want to grow quickly in Germany, Britain and particularly London are of our interest, and we’ll head to the US at some point.” Porkka points out that there are differences between countries and markets in how actively people search for new business opportunities. He thinks that in the US the social aspect of working life plays a bigger role than in the Nordic countries. In the long run, Meshly wants to be absolutely everywhere and have all business people on its list. Porkka believes in vast potential. “Our underlying vision is to be the best solution available on the market. The number one in the world, that is.” Many matchmaking applications are compared to the dating app Tinder. Porkka sees where the comparison comes from, but doesn’t agree with it. “Meshly is an all-inclusive networking and communication platform, and it’s not meant to be used just at a certain phase in life. I don’t think a lot of people want to stay on Tinder forever.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/noona-brings-cancer-clinics-to-patients-fingertips/,Noona brings cancer clinics to patients’ fingertips,"There is no hiding from the growing number of cancer cases. While the quality of cancer treatment is ever improving, the recovery process can make patients feel isolated. It is here Finnish mobile service Noona hopes to bring greatly improved support and care to their fingertips. is both jet-lagged and excited. The chairman and co-founder of   has just returned from a three-week US tour where he presented Noona on the main stage of the prestigious ‘Health 2.0’ conference in Silicon Valley ‒ becoming the first Finnish company to do so. What has got everyone excited is Noona’s potential to revolutionise the relationship between cancer patients and clinics. “Noona is Korean and means ‘a big sister who takes care of you’,” says Ahonala, who has worked as a cancer care consultant and researcher for over 10 years. “The number of cancer patients is growing and as most can be cured thanks to more sophisticated treatments, the new challenge is how to best support and help them after treatment.” This is where Noona comes in help. Developed in close collaboration with the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), the cloud-based service lets cancer patients in remission track and report their wellbeing through a simple online interface which can be accessed on mobile, tablet or PC. At the cancer clinic, nurses get a holistic, real-time view on their patients’ progress and are alerted if acute attention is needed. Noona Healthcare’s Co-Founder Jani Ahonala wants to use the data gathered through Noona to improve cancer treatment and assist new therapies. Noona is a significant shake-up of current methods. Currently achieving similar post-treatment care levels requires numerous phone calls, meetings and often leads to frustration on both sides when patients cannot get hold of clinic staff who are tackling ever increasing workloads. For example HUCH Cancer Centre alone has over 5 000 breast cancer patients it monitors for five years after treatment ends. “Noona’s greatest features are its algorithms. The system automatically knows if the symptoms a patient experiences are severe,” says Ahonala. “When the patient reports their symptoms via Noona, the service recognises when they need acute medical attention and ensures the patient will be well looked after.” Noona knows the patient’s medical history and can ask more detail on the type, duration and location of symptoms. If immediate action is not required it gives advice on self-treatment and monitoring. The end goal is to improve both the quality and accessibility of recovery care. “Noona categorises the patients based on their treatment needs,” Ahonala explains. “This means clinics can target their resources more efficiently and focus first on the patients who have the most acute situation.” Noona, which was launched in August initially for breast cancer patients, is currently used at Oulu University Hospital in Northern Finland and in an 800 patient strong clinical trial at HUCH. Two additional Nordic agreements will be announced shortly as well as plans to expand Noona’s ability to cover additional cancer types. Which takes us back to the US. As Ahonala met with local healthcare professionals and potential investors, he explains it became clear that across the pond is where the most valuable market lies. “They are working with exactly same challenges in the US,” Ahonala says. “We are one of the forerunners when it comes to cancer treatment and specialist health care.“ Noona’s US excursion was part of a ‘Team Finland Health’ startup tour arranged by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation and Finpro. It was the third time Ahonala participated in the tour, and if there is one thing he has learnt, it is putting yourself out there, compelling stories and networking play key roles in the highly competitive American market: “First they buy you, then your company and lastly what you actually do,” says Ahonala. “You can’t just tell where you come from and what you do, you need to be able to tell a story people will remember.” Ahonala notes Americans are intrigued by your background and product, but what really interests them is where you are heading: “In addition to having a good product, users and some turnover, what is emphasised is your vision and goals,” Which begs the obvious question: what is Ahonala’s vision for Noona? “Our goal is to have over one million users within three years and the world’s largest database on wellbeing and recovery of cancer patients during and after treatment,” Ahonala says. “This would enable Noona to provide researchers with new information on how different treatments and cancer types affect people’s lives.” The recovery process can be a lonely experience for cancer patients. Noona’s mobile service was created to bring care and support to their fingertips."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/relex-solutions-keeps-it-fresh/,Relex Solutions keeps it fresh,"Finland’s Relex are specialists in supply chain logistics. Their job is to help their clients stock more products while simultaneously reducing inventory and spoilage. The next time you are in the produce section of a grocery store, stop and think of all the work that went into their selection. They have fruits and vegetables which came from all points of the compass. Some may have been produced locally while others were shipped from halfway around the world. Practically all have different shelf lives, too. If you think it sounds complicated to manage, you’re right. The Finnish company   has made it their mission to simplify this process. They are logistics specialists, and their goal is to help their customers have a better selection of products with less waste. The company uses Big Data technology for their services, and integrate the database with the user interface “Our business model is a very low risk to our customers,” says Relex managing director  . “We provide significant measurable benefits in increased sales from improved product availability, lower stock and supply chain costs from improved accuracy in demand and inventory planning, and lowered labour costs by reducing routine tasks and letting the experts focus on more challenging issues.” The company uses Big Data technology for their services, and integrate the database with the user interface. Kärkkäinen praises their method, saying it is different from their competitors and allows more exact planning. They use feedback from actual operations to personalise the solution for each customer. “As we believe we do not earn our pay if the customer does not get benefits, we seek only win-win relationships where we can operate with short contract termination times, so we are kicked off if the benefits don’t materialise,” he says. Relex’s largest group of customers are retailers which have a diverse group of products with various shelf lives. This includes not only grocery stores, but everything from electronics shops to garden centres. “Wholesalers are our second biggest customer group – and there we have slightly more food wholesalers – but our customers cover all sectors of wholesale trade,” Kärkkäinen continues. “There are also industrial manufacturers where we have been able to significantly help their demand planning process. Geographically, they are currently focusing on three regions: the Nordic area, the UK, and the heart of Europe with Germany, Austria and Switzerland. “The next big thing for us is expansion to the US, which is planned to happen in early 2016,” says Kärkkäinen. “As we believe we do not earn our pay if the customer does not get benefits, we seek only win-win relationships where we can operate with short contract termination times, so we are kicked off if the benefits don’t materialise,” says Relex CEO Mikko Kärkkäinen. Relex has had a positive start to 2015 with growth and new customers in all their operating regions. In their home market of Finland they have diverse clients like the fashion house Marimekko and the bookstore Suomalainen, but Kärkkäinen sees more value to Finland than merely as a source of customers. “Finland offers good access to intelligent personnel who are used to think on their own, take responsibility and make decisions independently,” he says. “Secondly, in Finland people usually tend to really want to listen to what you have to say. They appreciate your thoughts and innovative ideas, which is a big plus in starting a business-to-business company. In Finland it has been easy to develop and maintain our unique corporate culture.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/dream-broker-uses-video-to-revolutionise-corporate-communications/,Dream Broker uses video to revolutionise corporate communications,"Finland’s Dream Broker has developed a cloud-based system for companies to communicate using videos. They say the core of their philosophy is to help people communicate, collaborate and learn. I once worked for a company notorious for their executives’ copious and boring memos. Management suspected we weren’t reading them (they were right), so switched to voice mail which could be checked. Of course, we simply set our phones down on our desks to drone on for 45 minutes every morning, ignored.   knew this was a common problem throughout the corporate world and developed an innovative solution. Dream Broker helps people create, edit and share online videos on any device. Through their tools company employees can collaborate on strategy implementation, train new staff, explain new software or share best practices, all through video. “Medium and big-sized companies are important employers, and we want to do our share for Finnish society and challenge entrepreneurs and companies to create more medium and big-sized companies in Finland,” says Mika Ahokas, CEO of Dream Broker. “People are audio visual by nature, and video enables us to use more of our senses when communicating,” says Dream Broker CEO  . “When we talk about ‘communicate, collaborate and learn’ we are concretely talking about our mission. It is all about communications, and video is the most powerful and influential way to communicate as it is information rich.” Yet the use of video instead of memos or emailed presentations is not simply a change in communication tools. Dream Broker wanted a more interactive experience. “‘Collaborate’ refers to the special characteristic of video that content can be created together and utilised by many,” he continues. “Instead of top-down communication, video embraces collaboration. Video lets people participate in communication and work as a team. Moreover, video as a communication format draws attention, which means more people receive the message and are inspired to further similar collaboration.” Ahokas points out that Dream Broker began with screen recording technology which was mainly used for training in IT rollouts and deployments. This educational aspect remains an important goal for many of their customers. “With videos traditional classroom training sessions can be replaced with video training, where the exercise can be completed at the convenience of the viewer as the material is always available.” Dream Broker concentrated on the Finnish market for their first five years, but have since expanded throughout the Nordic region. They employ 80 people and consider the Nordics as their domestic market, but are now on the cusp on further expansion. Dream Broker concentrated on the Finnish market for their first five years, but have since expanded throughout the Nordic region. “Many companies avoid growing larger because growth can be a risk and some companies even die. Medium-sized companies with scarce resources face the same responsibilities as large ones,” says Ahokas. “It’s easy to reach our size, but to grow any further requires much more. Now it is time to see what Dream Broker is made of: will our growth continue or will we fade away?” After the company grows sustainably in the Nordic area, they plan to expand into the Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain. Next up would be a trip across the Atlantic to tackle the North American market. “Medium and big-sized companies are important employers, and we want to do our share for Finnish society and challenge entrepreneurs and companies to create more medium and big-sized companies in Finland,” Ahokas concludes. “Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and do it.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cabforce-attracts-major-acquirer-with-car-trawler/,Cabforce attracts major acquirer with Car Trawler,"Finland’s Cabforce will join with Ireland’s Car Trawler in a deal which will help Finnish operations grow.  and  , two leading high-tech firms focused on ground transportation, are joining forces. Finland’s fast-growing taxi booking specialist Cabforce will be acquired by Dublin-based Car Trawler. Car Trawler is a provider of travel technology and aggregates car rental and ground transportation services. CEO   stresses the strengths the two companies will bring each other. “Car Trawler already has the most comprehensive range of car rentals available online,” he said in a statement. “Now with the addition of Cabforce content and specialist expertise to our existing portfolio of ground transportation products we will significantly enhance the level of service, product range and availability for customers.” Cabforce allows a traveller to pre-book taxis, executive cars or minibuses without surprise fees or long waits in queues. Cabforce was founded by frequent business travellers frustrated with taxi services around the world. They first thought to improve the dispatch system and location awareness of local companies, but soon switched to solving the problem of finding safe and reliable service. They allow a traveller to pre-book taxis, executive cars or minibuses without surprise fees or long waits in queues. The company began servicing only eight European cities in January 2012 and soon spread over six continents. Turnover is growing at about a 300 per cent pace, and they believe with the acquisition they will now be able to grow even more strongly. “Cabforce currently employs nineteen people in its Otaniemi, Espoo office,” says Cabforce CEO  . “The number of employees will grow in Finland faster than without the acquisition. Cabforce’s owners and employees are very happy about the deal.” Hansson stresses that without the support of Finnish institutions Cabforce would never have grown and attracted such a strong acquirer. “The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes’ support has helped Cabforce significantly,” he says. “The company has gone through the Young Innovative Companies program as well as received R&D funding.” Car Trawler plans to turn Cabforce’s Otaniemi, Espoo offices into a “Centre of Excellence” to develop the travellers’ ground transportation booking service. “Cabforce is a tech company with great potential not just in the Finnish market but worldwide,” says  , CTO of Car Trawler. “With the right catalyst a Finnish tech success story will become an integral part of a global business. We believe that Car Trawler will provide that catalyst. The broader infrastructure and global distribution base that Cabforce will enjoy when fully integrated with Car Trawler will accelerate their access to new markets and customer segments, bringing technology of Finnish origins to customers all over the world.” He points out that the new era of online business has changed the way companies operate, and their boundaries are not defined by borders or other geographic barriers. “Our decision to acquire Cabforce was based on it helping to accelerate our global growth which includes, but is not limited to, the Finnish market,” Healy concludes. “Cabforce’s partnerships and expertise in the area of taxi booking solutions – when combined with Car Trawler’s global footprint and advanced technology – will create a leading ground transportation company, not just in Finland but all over the world.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-offers-a-diabetes-diary-with-a-twist/,Finnish startup offers a diabetes diary with a twist,"387 million people are estimated to live with diabetes globally and the number keeps rising. Finnish startup Sensotrend plans to make their lives a little easier.  “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999. Living with it requires lots of studying to understand how much insulin I need in different situations” says  , founder of  . “If I’d been on a run or played football, I would inject a certain dose of insulin and eat in a certain way, but I missed a tool that would help me to keep better track of this data and learn from it.” This is the challenge Rinnetmäki set out to solve when he started work on an automated diabetes diary two years ago. The idea is simple: to help diabetics keep track of their blood glucose, nutrition, physical activity and medication without tedious manual logging. The online diary imports data directly from products diabetics already use such as insulin pumps, activity trackers and meal apps. The data is then visualised to help the user, or their healthcare professionals, to see what effect exercise, specific meals or stress levels have on blood glucose levels so they can adjust treatment plans accordingly. “You can easily see not only how your blood sugar has fluctuated, but also what has influenced it,” Rinnetmäki explains. “This will help to determine the correct insulin dosage in the future as you better understand how much you need in different situations.” It’s not only the integration with other services that sets Sensotrend apart, but also its focus on physical activity. Rinnetmäki himself is very active and feels this still poses one of the greatest challenges to diabetics. “If you want to start training for a marathon or going to the gym, it might take months to get your insulin dosage right and there aren’t any tools that help you with it.” Sensotrend’s automated diabetes diary gathers data from products like insulin pumps, blood glucose meters and meal apps. The data is then visualised to help users, or their doctor, better understand their insulin and treatment needs. While the diary doesn’t suggest insulin dosages, at least not in its early version, it helps the user learn how active they’ve been, the effects of physical activity on their blood sugar and how to balance it. “We still leave the treatment decisions for the person and their doctor, but we can make the data easier to share and help them to analyse it,” says Rinnetmäki. “We want to enable the collection of richer data which can also be used to develop [insulin dosage] calculators further.“ Sensotrend has been developing its diabetes diary in cooperation with diabetes doctors, nurses and potential users since it was founded in early 2014. “When we started building the diary, we were alone in this space but now we are starting to see others. No one is doing exactly the same but something similar,” comments Rinnetmäki. But he doesn’t see competition as a negative: “Diabetics have so many different requirements that we need different solutions for them all. There will never be one solution to suit everybody.” Currently Sensotrend is preparing its first real-world pilot with a diabetes clinic in its hometown  of Tampere, in central Finland. If everything goes well, a full international launch will be scheduled for the World Diabetes Day in November. While Western markets are the company’s first target, the roadmap doesn’t stop there. “Problems are very different in parts of Africa where a type 1 diabetic can even die within a few years of diagnosis. We are thinking of ways to get support there. In five years time we hope to be serving diabetics all around the world,” Rinnetmäki concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/robots-dispense-global-success-for-newicon/,Robots dispense global success for NewIcon,"Robots can fly planes and drive cars. Thanks to the innovations of one Finnish startup they can also help you get the right medicine. It is the robot’s time to shine. The hospital pharmacy has received a delivery of medications. The staff is busy, but no one needs to take the time to put the drugs in their places. Instead, the robot does it. A small conveyer belt carries boxes of medicines up to a white robot arm, which takes each box, identifies it and sends it to the correct storage slot. “Our solutions make customer processes more efficient and streamlined, and that gives financial benefits,” says  , marketing director of the Finnish firm  . “Our products also ease employee’s work by doing repetitive tasks.” At the other end of the pharmacy a pharmacist types in a new prescription. In the room behind her another robot arm whirs into action. It gently picks up a box of medicine with suction cups and drops it into a slot. The pharmacist simply reaches back and picks up the medicine. “The most important benefit is the fact that by using our products customers can increase patient safety by minimising medicine errors,” Savolainen explains. Founded in 2007, the Kuopio-based NewIcon is a pioneer in automated medical solutions. It creates sorting robots, automated storage systems for medications and robots for intravenous antibiotic compounding, as well as software to run all the equipment. NewIcon robots can help you get the right medicine. As health care providers continually search for increased safety and efficiency NewIcon sees a huge global potential for their business. Investors agree: in November 2014 Finnish Industry Investment and the pension company Etera invested 2.3 million euros into the company. The company is using that capital to further development of their products and to build an international sales network. “Our international expansion journey has just begun,” continues Savolainen. “We have started export sales in Russia and we have built distribution networks in nine countries. At the moment we are looking forward to openings in the Middle East, the UK, Scandinavia and China.” Savolainen credits the trust from investors and public groups like Tekes as one of the keys to their success. He also says there are other benefits of being based in Finland. “We have here a great source of high technology and innovation expertise. We also have customers here who appreciate organisations who are dedicated to solving their problems.” The Finnish domestic health care industry already knows NewIcon well and their storage automation systems are widely used and trusted. Back in the hospital pharmacy the pharmacist checks the box of medicine which the robot gave her. It’s correct; there will be no dispensing errors. Improving safety and reliability is one of the prime concerns of medical professionals. A study published in Frontier Economics found medication errors cost the UK up to 3.5 billion euros annually. “The automation for medical care is in a transition phase,” Savolainen concludes. “Pioneer customers are using new technology and behind them are many followers waiting for their feedback. The benefits and advantages can be seen easily and the future for medical automation seems really bright.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ouraring-squeezed-a-wellness-device-into-a-design-jewel/,Oura Health squeezes wellness into design jewel,"A finger can give a lot of information what’s going on inside us. To capture that information, Oura Health created a mini-computer inside a ring which partners with a mobile app to offer advice for the wellbeing of both body and mind. How to obtain a constant flow of information from the body without having to bind the person into sensors? CEO   and CTO and head of design   from   decided to combine style and wellbeing intelligence into a product many of us already wear: a ring. ”Fitting technology into such a small piece was a huge challenge,” says Lahtela. “We got started deeming it possible.” The idea of a new type of a wearable technology product stemmed from the entrepreneurs’ personal experiences. Having had hectic careers in the technology industry, they wanted to create something that would help people listen to their own body and maintain its balance. The group started researching what was available in the market. Heart rate monitors and different types of sensors tended to have two similar issues: they are often impractical to use and not very stylish to wear. Lahtela points out that it’s impossible to wear a heart rate band all the time. ”From the very beginning we’ve wanted to create a product that is as convenient as possible to as many people as possible,” adds Kivelä. The market for wearables is growing at a fast pace. Health care systems will change so that individuals will begin to take more and more responsibility over their personal wellbeing,” CEO Petteri Lahtela predicts. The ŌURA ring collects raw data about heart rate and its changes, measures the amount and intensity of physical activity, and analyses the quality of sleep and its different stages. Using algorithms the mini-computer interprets the body’s reactions and their changes, and sends the information to the mobile app. From the app users find information about their readiness level and get advice as to how to improve it. ”The ring listens to the body, and the app then gives guidance in words and visual cues,” Lahtela explains. CTO and head of design Kivelä is not only an engineer, but also a jewellery designer. The ring is designed by him and renowned Finnish industrial designer  . ”The timing has been perfect for us, as for example components have become available just at the right time,” he says. “In comparison to the first sketches the ring is now more compact and stylish.” In the beginning the most crucial feature was the measuring of heart rate and related parameters. Other sensors joined in later, and now the main aim of the ring is to help improve recovery. As the ring is waterproof and its battery lasts for days, it can be worn all day long. Hence it learns to give personalised advice for each individual. Many dimensions of human life starting from social interaction have already gone online. Lahtela and Kivelä don’t think the ring is now technologising wellbeing, too. “Quite the contrary; the ring helps its user understand his or her body even better. With the information we can pay attention to our mental and physical readiness, and try and maintain them at the highest possible level.” The ring doesn’t claim to know its user’s emotions better than the person. ”The app occasionally asks different types of questions about how the user is actually feeling. Then it combines these feelings with physiology and behaviour,” tells Kivelä. The ring was launched at a startup fair in San Francisco in early March. For consumers the product will be available in September. The ring partners with a mobile app which gives users information about their readiness level and advice as to how to improve it. Oura Health is headed to the United States, where wearable technology is of particular interest. “The market for wearables is growing at a fast pace,” Lahtela predicts. “Healthcare systems will change so that individuals will begin to take more and more responsibility over their personal wellbeing.” In Finland the company is registered under the name Jouzen, but in international marketing only the ŌURA brand and the name ŌURA will be visible. In addition to the headquarters in Oulu, the company has one person working in Helsinki, one in Japan and one in San Francisco. The now 11-employee team is growing continuously. The product development takes place in Oulu, and the production itself happens in Haukipudas, 20 kilometres away from the headquarters. The covers and circuit boards are produced in South Korea. ”The ring is a premium product, and for us it’s crucial to be able to guarantee top-notch quality on every level. We don’t cut corners at any stage,” says Lahtela."

All year round, come rain or shine, he sets up his roadside stall in the outskirt of Delhi to sell cut-price clothing. His daily income varies, but on average he makes about three–four euros a day. Like most vendors in the area, he is illiterate but able to do basic calculations. Taking care of finances has always been a challenge for Mukesh. He says that is it nearly impossible to get to the bank from his stall: “It would take me several hours to make a simple deposit, which would result in a loss of earning.” Now the Finnish co-operative   is easing the vendors’ daily burden with its recently created automated SMS-based receipt service. Along with Mukesh, 2 500 Delhi street vendors have signed up for the Finnish mfore service. It is a simple idea. The bank’s trusted representative collects the money from all the vendors in the market at the end of the trading day and makes a deposit on their behalf. After the transaction is done, the vendor gets an SMS receipt on their phone. So far about 2 500 Delhi street vendors have signed up for the mfore service. “They can also withdraw the money via their mobile phone,” says  , project manager from mfore. “The system saves the vendors’ time, money and bureaucracy.” The messaging service can be used with all types of networks and devices. Vast majority of cell phones used in India are basic handsets due to high cost of smartphones. On top of the SMS-based receipt service, mfore is currently running several other projects in India with the help of local Nidan’s Sanchay Cooperative Bank. The ultimate aim of mfore is to empower India’s poor and disadvantaged with the latest technology. The co-operative has an Indo-Finnish background, with many of its employees being ex-Nokians. Hence the group sees India as its main market area at the moment but has also plans to extend its services elsewhere. Latest innovation from the Finnish co-operative is a health care service platform, which gives the patient the ability to communicate directly with the clinic. “The aim is to create a genuine interaction between the clinic and the patient with an SMS-based technology,” says  , adviser at mfore. “We call it patient engagement, which benefits all sides.” The company says mobile messaging technologies work well in India even though the coverage of networks can be patchy at times. “The time has come for businesses to take some responsibility, one way or another, because not everything can be measured in monetary terms,” says Aittola. Finnish company mfore sees India as its main market area at the moment but has also plans to extend its services elsewhere."

After three years of development, his patented water leakage detector has finally gone on sale and it’s flying off virtual shelves. “My background is in real estate and construction and over the years I have seen water damage of all shapes and sizes,” says Alatainio, CEO of NWD Technologies, the company he founded in 2012 to develop the product. “I have seen how common they are and statistics show they are only getting more frequent. This is how I got the idea for a new kind of alarm system that can be fit to any space.”  is a water leakage indicator which consists of two parts: a sensor mat created with printable electronics and an alarm unit. The sensor mat comes in a 50×50 centimetre square, but is deceptively versatile. It can be cut to almost any shape and placed wherever there is a risk of leakage, such as under a washing machine or in a kitchen sink cupboard. If any of the sensors detect water or dampness on the mat, the attached alarm unit is alerted and sounds in a manner similar to a smoke detector. “The benefit of our alarm is that especially difficult and concealed leakage can be discovered before it causes wide damage,” Alatainio explains. “It has been received very positively.” In isolation dampness and/or water leakage detectors aren’t a completely new innovation, but until now they have had one significant handicap: size. The Watector water leakage sensor consists of a sensor mat and an alarm unit. The mat can be cut to any shape and size with normal scissors and it detects if there is any dampness or water on its surface “Typically water alarms only measure a very limited area, about the size of a thumb. Our mat can cover a much larger area which is a clear benefit,” says Alatainio.  “According to the novelty examinations we have conducted there is nothing like our product, even internationally.” Another benefit is that Watector is easy to install and it doesn’t require any special expertise or tools. The sensor mat can be cut to the desired shaped with scissors and after the alarm unit is attached to it, the product is ready to go. As an added perk, the mat is completely recyclable. The product has been patented in Finland and protected with an EU-wide trademark, while the international patent process is underway. Of course water damage isn’t only a problem in Finland and since its launch in Mid-February, Watector has sparked enquiries from many countries, including the US. “We did market studies early on and there is clear international demand for this product,” Alatainio says. “Our first step is to go the other Nordic countries and then expand to further parts of Europe and the US.” While the company’s current focus is on market expansion, the roadmap also includes further development of the product to meet the needs of the retail and construction industry. Alatainio gives the example of Watector eventually being integrated directly into kitchen furniture. Plans of this scale mean growing what is currently a one-man company. Alatainio has come far by the means of cooperation and outsourcing (even the product name and prototype packaging were finalised using a student project), but this is not enough for a company aiming to take over international markets. “I’ll definitely start to hire more people, there is no way I can keep doing this alone,” Alatainio says with a laugh. It could be a watershed moment for NWD Technologies. Water damage isn’t only a problem in Finland and since Watector’s launch in mid-February, it has sparked inquiries from many countries, including the US."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-testdroid-takes-mobile-app-testing-to-the-cloud/,Finland’s Testdroid takes mobile app testing to the Cloud,"How do developers make sure their applications will work on diverse devices? Staring at the sky may have given Bitbar inspiration to solve this problem: do testing in the Cloud. You’ve just created an exciting mobile application. But how can you tell if it will work correctly on the hundreds of different devices being used today? Do you need to go out and buy all these devices to do your testing? The Finnish company   has come up with a new solution: Testdroid. Testdroid allows mobile app developers to test their creation on over 400 unique Android models and all possible variants of Apple’s iOS. A client can go online and check their app against real devices using diverse platforms and even different screen resolutions. “Our main customers are mobile app and game developers building their stuff for Android and iOS,” says Bitbar’s technical product manager  . “This includes a variety: indie developers, smaller game studios, and even larger corporations and big brands. They all build their native, hybrid or web-based applications on mobile platforms.” Business is currently booming. In February 2015 Testdroid Cloud had over 8.2 million test runs, while new customers are doubling or tripling quarter by quarter. Bitbar uses their Testroid service in three different ways. Clients can test publicly on the Cloud, privately on the Cloud with dedicated and reserved devices, or privately in the client’s own development environment. Helppi says their flexibility is one of their greatest strengths. “Our main customers are mobile app and game developers building their stuff for Android and iOS,” says Bitbar’s technical product manager Ville-Veikko Helppi. “Testroid can be accessed through API, manually, with test automation and the customer’s own build-systems with continuous integration,” he explains. “This makes connecting any device to the developer’s build-systems, development tools and other software extremely easy and straightforward.” The company has attracted global attention from venture capitalists as well as customers. Investors from Germany, the UK, Finland and the United States – including the chip maker Qualcomm’s venture arm – have taken a stake in Bitbar. “In Finland, we have our headquarters in Helsinki and research and development in Oulu,” continues Helppi. “Both locations provide an excellent base for doing business and product development for global customers. The benefits of having operations in Finland are the excellent, competent workforce and plenty of knowledge of mobile technologies.” Bitbar also has a hosting centre in Mountain View, California and a sales office in San Francisco. They have more operations in Wroclaw, Poland, where the majority of the Testdroid Cloud devices are connected. “The mobile application scene is growing tremendously, and more apps and games are emerging for all major platforms,” Helppi says. “We’ve managed to build solid products that provide value. We help these global app developers make their apps robust and of better quality, all while using real devices in the process.” Bitbar has enjoyed substantial growth, but mobile phones applications is already a well-established industry. By the standards of fast-moving high-technology it could almost be considered mature. Where is the growth for the future? “The next sector where apps on Android and iOS can be utilised are wearables,” says Helppi. “We already host several smart watches that users can instantly access, run their apps and get rich reports about performance and potential issues on those devices.” The company has attracted global attention from venture capitalists: investors from Germany, the UK, Finland and the United States have taken a stake in Bitbar."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/papu-weaves-stories-into-its-eco-friendly-children-s-clothes/,Papu weaves stories into its eco-friendly children’s clothes,"Children’s clothing brand Papu wants to produce clothes good enough to make them collectables. Eco-friendliness and responsibility are the guidelines for not only Papu’s products, but also their production: their European collaborators have been checked out in person. ’s clothes are born from adventures. The whole collection is presented not only in catalogues, but also in stories, poems, and activity books. , the founder of Papu, thinks that having a story behind each collection can increase the clothes’ emotional value in the eyes of their users. ”Appreciating a product might sound superficial, but it makes it last longer and hence more ecological,” she points out. Kurkela describes stories as an endless fountain of ideas. This year the collection is based on poetry; the summer collection goes camping with a turnip and a sweet potato, and come autumn, the collection walks down a path coloured by different shades of nature. The story of the clothes isn’t only known at the level of fairytales. The people at Papu know exactly what the history of a piece of clothing is like. ”We know where our products are made, and we trust our collaborators 100 per cent,” says communications officer  . “Our customers can get very specific information about our production if they so wish.” Papu’s clothes are designed by Anna Kurkela, and the books and clothing prints are illustrated by  . The production takes place in Portugal and the majority of GOTS certified cotton comes from Turkey. Papu’s clothes are born from adventures. The whole collection is presented not only in catalogues, but also in stories, poems, and activity books. Globally the clothing industry has a terrible reputation due to, for example, the exploitation of workforce and the usage of poisonous chemicals. The folks at Papu have personally travelled to check out how their collaborators work. The policy is to keep the production in Europe. ”In Portugal Papu products are made by professional adults. Small amounts of products have been ordered from seamstresses in Finland,” tells Marja Kurkela. Responsibility doesn’t end there. Papu wants to sell clothes that not only last from one child to another, but also grow together with the child. Combination sizes can be enlarged or decreased with turnover ribbings and double buttons. In design the aim is to be timeless. The models don’t focus on trends. ”When a new catalogue comes out, the products from the previous seasons still don’t get old. Hopefully the opposite will happen: sold-out clothes become sought-after rarities,” Anna Kurkela says. By accident Papu has ended up making clothes for adults too. Initially the idea was to get everyone in the office a pair of leggings with a Papu print, but due to a surprising demand they stayed in the selection. The first steps of Papu were taken when the founder Anna Kurkela was studying fashion design. At the time she was interested in producing clothes as ecologically as possible. After her first child was born, she started to gain interest in children’s clothes. Things got serious in 2012. Up until 2014 she alone was responsible for the company. She designed the collections together with Heikkilä, but everything else from marketing to delivering the orders she did mostly on her own. ”It became clear pretty soon that Anna’s resources wouldn’t suffice – and neither would the space in our living room,” says the CEO and Anna Kurkela’s husband,  . In total Papu employs seven people, two of whom work part-time. Last year Papu became a limited company. Its turnover more than doubled from the previous year, and it had resellers in Finland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy. This year’s collection will also travel to China, Austria, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Germany, and Portugal. According to Marja Kurkela, the percentage of international sales is growing fast. Papu plans on looking for an international sales expert to strengthen the team. “Our goal is that the majority of our turnover in 2016 comes from abroad,” Jussi Kurkela says. Going international isn’t cheap. This spring Papu is going to carry out a crowdfunding campaign, in which it sells shares of the company. “The aim of the campaign is to ensure our cash flow during the phase of fast growth and hence be able to employ new people,” Jussi Kurkela explains. Papu Stories turned into a family business when the founder Anna Kurkela’s (right) husband Jussi Kurkela (left) started as the company CEO."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nostalgic-success-for-finnish-game-studio/,Nostalgic success for Finnish game studio,"By now, the interwoven fabric of the Finnish gaming community is a well thumbed-through story. Nonetheless, it is always a pleasure to hear when the pay-it-forward attitude of the local ecosystem sees a fresh upstart included into the fold and eventually succeed globally. Five years ago graphic designer   and programmer brothers   and  found themselves out of a job. The global financial crisis had seen to it that the games company they worked for dissolved its operations in Finland. As a result, their dream of kickstarting their own venture together was promptly transferred from the backburner.   was born. Given the nature of the local industry, it wasn’t long before a window of opportunity swung open for the trio. Fellow Finnish studio Mountain Sheep had been asked to bring Remedy’s wildly successful   PC game to iOS. However, the offer arrived at a time when they were too involved with their own projects to commit completely and recommended that the budding company takes the reins. “Mountain Sheep worked as producers for us on the game, as we didn’t have much experience,” Jukka Viljamaa recalls. “We implemented and they supervised. We learnt a lot from the project and gained a lot of self-confidence.” And so they should have – positive reviews lauded the inventive design and visceral gameplay of their effort. The public responded in kind, with development costs recouped in just three days. It has since been played more than 60 million times by over five million gamers worldwide. Needless to say it wasn’t difficult for Cornfox & Brothers to secure financing for their next project, an idea they had been tinkering with for many years, one that would revisit the games of their youth. When the resultant game,  , first appeared in 2013, there was nothing like it available on the iOS platform. Its fantasy-based narrative and expansive gameplay rapidly cultivated a dedicated fanbase. Critics, meanwhile, were distracted by its similarity to Nintendo’s hugely influential  franchise. Oceanfox’s fantasy-based narrative and expansive gameplay rapidly cultivated a dedicated fanbase. “The things we borrowed were not copied because we wanted to make exact copies of the same things so it would sell,” Viljamaa explains. “The game was made out of our love and memories of those old games that we somehow wanted to recreate in a modern way.” Priced in the premium bracket,   has gone on to draw user numbers fast approaching one million. This is all the more impressive when the average playing time is considered. “It’s quite a different experience when you compare it to  , for instance,” Viljamaa explains. “Our game is not one you pick up for two minutes when you are awaiting for a bus. It has a story arc; it has a beginning and an ending and is intended for longer sessions at a time.” Over a year since its release, users continue to absorb themselves in the   world. A recent fan art and screenshot competition drew artists by the hundreds to articulate their inspiration. The game has even managed to penetrate the notoriously fickle South Korean and Japanese markets. After bringing the game back to its original PC roots by launching on the Steam entertainment platform in March, the trio fully intends to return to the well for   adventures in future. “There’s going to be more games of this world,” Viljamaa promises. “We are going to expand. Heikki has the whole back-story for the things in the game. There are so many things to be explained.” Heikki Repo and Jukka and Antti Viljamaa founded successful gaming company Cornfox & Borthers in 2010."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/volundeer-puts-its-hand-up-for-humanitarianism/,Volundeer puts its hand up for humanitarianism,"A new online service seeks to revolutionise volunteering by bringing global information, stories and opportunities together for the same cause.  Around 100 million people in Europe completed voluntary work over the last year or two. But altogether almost 200 million Europeans were willing to volunteer their time during the same period. So, why the discrepancy? The chief reason is difficulty with organising service provision – it is not unheard of to take two weeks to finalise a placement.   reduces it to two minutes. “The idea came from two of our co-founders,  and , who had done volunteer work for many years,” explains  . “They wondered why it should be so hard to find a position.” With the co-founding quartet rounded out by  , they set out to devise a way to bridge the gap between those with an altruistic persuasion and volunteering organisations. Volundeer is able to connect volunteers and organisations in two minutes The first port of call was to reach out to notable organisations that rely on volunteer assistance. The idea’s appeal was immediately apparent. In a short space of time the fledgling service had the support of Save the Children, Red Cross and Women’s Bank. “All these three have the same problem: they do not have enough volunteers,” Siekkinen explains. “They were all very enthusiastic with the idea and promised to help us all the way.” Unsurprisingly, this trio of big names greased the rails for attracting financial backing. Being recognised as having the “Most Potential Bubbling Under” at the recent Polar Bear Pitch event in Oulu, northern Finland, certainly didn’t hurt Volundeer’s prospects either. In keeping with the service’s philosophy, the service’s two current backers are unconcerned with the bottom line. “We don’t really want any normal venture capitalists with us,” Siekkinen says. “These two social investors have made their money and have always done some voluntary work and charity. Now they have the time to do something really big to impact on many people’s lives.” The service’s theme of goodwill extends to being free of charge for users. A non-compulsory fee is optional. “It’s not about money for us,” Siekkinen outlines. “It’s about doing something good with our lives. This is the way that things should go, not always concentrating on money. It’s about focusing on the impact you make.” Ensuring that this impact remains positive, each individual charity group makes the final decision on whether they will hire the candidate in question. Volundeer simply acts as a facilitator. The service is set to eventually go live later this year, opening the floodgates for a hive of volunteer-related activity. “We are building up social media so people can interact with one another,” Siekkinen states. “There’s going to be stories, videos and blog texts where people can get to know about different volunteers. Also we are planning to do a TV series on voluntary work.” “It’s not about money for us,” states Volundeer co-founder Jani Siekkinen. “It’s about doing something good with our lives.” Siekkinen outlines that all of this intends to address knowledge gaps related to volunteering. Speaking of which, one has to enquire of the genesis of Volundeer’s logo, an animated deer whose oversized heart is complemented by antlers forming the letter ‘V’. “It’s something I invented,” Siekkinen declares, searching for the right words to explain from where the idea emerged. “A deer is from Finland. Volun-deer, so… I just came up with it.” Does it have anything to do with deer having such a good reputation for volunteering? Siekkinen hesitates for a moment, mulling over the absurdity of the question. He breaks into laughter. “Yes, of course.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/geo-tech-sets-up-indian-finnish-joint-venture-in-helsinki/,GeoTech sets up Indian-Finnish joint venture in Helsinki,"Indian software development company GeoTech has been working with Scandinavian customers since 2008. Now with business booming the company has taken the next step: opening its first European operations in Helsinki, Finland. As a mobile and web applications specialist, Geo Tech has been delivering cost-efficient high quality services to Scandinavian customers for the past seven years. Encouraged by a growing demand and finding the right partners, the company believes it is the right time to establish a stronger presence in the region. Called ‘Geo Tech-IT’, its role is to act as Geo Tech’s first point of contact not only in Scandinavia but across Northern Europe. Geo Tech-IT is a joint venture headed up by Geo Tech’s existing Finnish partners   and   and opened its doors in Helsinki earlier this year. Initially Geo Tech-IT’s focus is on small and medium sized companies with the longer term aim of attracting larger corporations. “Our main services are in web and mobile app development. We offer the whole package from mock-ups to the final product,” says  , CTO of Geo Tech-IT. “We join the customer at an early stage and even help them in specifying the functionalities of the application which they intend to develop. We also solve many types of IT related problems.” Kolkata-based Geo Tech rose to success with a hybrid development model where customer communication and coordination are done locally in the customer’s own language. Main software development is then carried out in India using in-house developers and vetted by a network of certified partners. The model of execution will be no different in the new Finnish joint venture. “Currently we have a small core team of two people. This year we will probably grow to three or four people and in two to three years around 10 to 15 people would the right size for us,” explains Saukkonen. “We’ll mainly hire in project management and sales but also technical people. Having technical expertise in Finland makes the communication between our client and the programmers very easy.” “Everything we do in the Northern European region, we will be doing it all through GeoTech-IT,” says Kaushnik Khasnobis.  may have officially opened its doors in Helsinki only a few months ago, but its Finnish origins date back to 2008.  , CEO of the 2002 established GeoTech, was travelling to Finland two to three times a year to meet customers and met Saukkonen, who was working on an outsourcing project with the company in Finland. Over the years they formed a friendship which culminated in forming the Indian-Finnish joint venture. “When I started working in Finland, I saw big potential in the country and that people are very friendly,” says Khasnobis. “Quite a lot of Indian people worked for Nokia and we heard lots of good things from them. Also we did our first business development project in Finland with good results. Opening up a joint venture in Finland was on the cards for quite a long time and things just fell into place.” While a good location and appealing customer base attracted GeoTech to Finland, they also received lots of support and information from different Finnish organisations before making the final decision. “There were different levels of support, not only in the legalities of forming the joint venture but also in our individual business development,” Khasnobis says. GeoTech, which employs around 40 people altogether, sees the joint venture model as an attractive growth strategy and has a long term plan to establish a network of joint ventures around the world. It already has a 10-people joint venture in Tokyo and after Finland, the next stop is either the Middle East or South-East Asia. While GeoTech is planning its long-term global strategy, it is also looking into new service concepts. One of which includes helping interesting startups with their ideas. “Many startups have a concept of what they want to build, but they might not have the funding required to build it. In that case, if we really find the idea interesting, we try to do it for them in a sweat equity-way where we only cover our direct expenses but don’t take any immediate profit,” explains Khasnobis. “So GeoTech can help to build more business in Finland.” Saukkonen adds they are already working with a few startups and hope to see positive results soon. But the current focus remains on growing GeoTech-IT as a part of an expanding global software services network. “Everything we do in the Northern European region, we will be doing it all through GeoTech-IT,”  Khasnobis concludes. Kolkata-based GeoTech rose to success with a hybrid development model where customer communication and coordination are done locally in the customer’s own language."

The company has over the years bagged a clutch of well-known clients such as Wärtsilä, Siemens, Neste Jacobs, ABB, Rolls Royce, Thyssen Krupp and Technip but it is hungry for more. “We are eagerly looking at expanding our business in Asia and Middle East,” says Citec’s Indian operations director  . “We already have operations in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, where we will be developing strong business development teams.” Asia in particular is in focus for Citec. Countries like India, Singapore and Malaysia are developing fast. Specifically talking about India, Citec says it is well poised to take advantage of India’s fast growing sectors such as services, manufacturing, real estate, construction and utilities. The company’s Indian operations have grown fast in the last decade and today its strategy is to double the number of employees in India to thousand by 2017. “Two-third of Citec’s global resources are expected to come from India. The role of India is constantly growing Citec and it is an opportunity for us,” Mulani says. Citec is not limiting its ambitions to Asia alone. It recently worked in a mammoth engineering services project for Finnish Wärtsilä’s power plant in the Jordanese capital Amman. “It was of one Wärtsilä’s biggest ever projects, completed in 2014 and we did 49,000 engineering hours in the project so it was an extensive and extremely interesting project to carry out,” Mulani explains. Citec is well poised to take advantage of India’s fast growing sectors such as services, manufacturing, real estate, construction and utilities. The Vaasa – based company intends to focus more on local sales and expand its energy and power plant industry expertise in the oil and gas sector too. Large international energy and industrial projects mean that often consulting work is outsourced to low-cost countries. India is known to have inexpensive but highly trained engineering and IT workforce. However, Citec has managed to build an export model for global projects, in which project management and design is done in Finland, and implementation takes place in places like India. For Citec, the mantra of great quality is at the core of its customer service. “We have more of ‘doers’, who are passionate enough to take on challenging tasks. We believe great quality is the best marketing effort, customers come back only when they are happy with the quality and the expertise,” Mulani says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nautor-s-swan-sails-gracefully-towards-its-half-century/,Nautor’s Swan sails gracefully towards its half-century,"Over 2 000 yachts have been launched from the small Finnish coastal town of Pietasaari, to be enjoyed by sailors from all over the world. As flowers blossoming and leaves blooming announce the arrival of spring, it’s not unusual to see swans appearing on the shoreline in Finland, having returned from winters spent in warmer southern climes. However, some 500 kilometres north from Helsinki in the town of Pietarsaari, swans of an altogether different breed can be witnessed this time of year. At the end of April, Nautor’s Swan commences launching a number of luxury performance sailing yachts – or Swans – into the sea, signalling the final step of their construction process. “Our Swans are a unique balance between elegance, performance and quality,” explains  , Sales Director at the company. “They look beautiful in the water; in sailing what is beautiful also sails well.” Although ownership of the company these days is Italian, the company remains resolutely Finnish. The overwhelming majority of its staff is located in Finland. This beautiful sailing has been designed and constructed in the Finnish coastal town since 1966. Legend has it that founder chose the graceful waterfowl as his yachts’ moniker after coming across the sailing ship Suomen Joutsen, the swan of Finland, during a walk in Turku. “Looking back almost 50 years later I think it’s the perfect name for the product we make,” Jungell states. “They are elegant, strong and beautiful.” Although ownership of the company these days is Italian, the company remains resolutely Finnish. The overwhelming majority of its staff is located in Finland, and the construction process is spread over three different facilities in the Pietarsaari area. The company has launched over 2 000 yachts since its founding, with Swans currently ranging from 53 to 115 feet in length. Not all of these have been solely built for cruising, however. The Swan 36’s victory in 1968 at the Cowes Week set a course for many competitive Swans to follow. “Clearly for a sailing yacht, performance is a key value,” Jungell reflects. “It is the joy of sailing. It is one aspect we don’t compromise on that keeps bringing clients up here.” Upon placing an order for their yacht and waiting anywhere up to two years for its delivery, the customer is now part of an exclusive club, Club Swan, a passionate community filled with Swan owners and enthusiasts. More than 95 per cent of the entire fleet is still afloat, thus many Swans are now on to their third or fourth owners. Nonetheless, many continue to stay in touch with their yacht, even as ownership changes hands. This enthusiasm and joy of sailing is reflected in the yachts’ durability. “Not all 50-year-old sailing boats look attractive anymore,” Jungell says. “But we now see many older Swans that are very sought after on the market, bought by enthusiasts who restore them to mint condition.” The boating industry sailed into troubled waters as a result of the financial crisis. Nonetheless, Nautor’s Swan was able to weather the storm, maintaining a strong presence in Europe, and also developing its customer base in the USA and into the Chinese market. Given the high price point of the end product, the boating industry inevitably sailed into troubled waters as a result of the financial crisis in 2008-9. Nonetheless, Nautor’s Swan was able to weather the storm, maintaining a strong presence in Europe, and also developing its customer base in the USA and into the Chinese market. “We had the fortune of still being able to develop new products,” Jungell explains. “As a result of that, we have a unique portfolio of yachts being built at present. We have four 115-foot Swans and a new Swan 95 being built and we are coming up also with a new line that is more geared for cruising. With that as a starting point we are looking ahead and look forward to the next 50 years.” Text: James O’Sullivan"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/forget-fitness-apps-new-finnish-virtual-coach-improves-life-skills/,"Forget fitness apps, new Finnish virtual coach improves life skills","No fitness tracking or instant results here, Helsinki-based Newolo has taken a different approach to wellbeing. Its virtual coaching service improves mental fitness through cognitive behavioural methods. The 750 km Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain is, for many, a journey for personal growth. For Finn   it was also a start of a new career. “I was alone, surrounded by nature and thinking about my past, where I was headed and what I wanted from life,” Juutilainen describes. “It was like a life inventory and so fruitful that I started to think how a similar experience could be achieved virtually. That’s how the idea for   was born.” The company was officially established in 2011 after Juutilainen met his similarly minded co-founders   and  . In partnership with the Technical Research Centre of Finland VTT they started to build an online coaching service for self-improvement based on the methods of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). The ‘Newolo VirtualCoach’ was first launched in Finland in late 2012 and is now available in four languages across Western Europe. Newolo doesn’t provide instant fixes. The aim is to improve mental fitness and help with adoption of new life skills, especially in a work life context.The virtual coaching program, tailored to match a user’s personality, takes 10 weeks to complete and requires in average 45 minutes of weekly training, including written exercises and video lessons. Newolo’s VirtualCoach is based on the ideas of cognitive behavioural therapy CBT. The key concept in CBT is that thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are all interconnected and a person can manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. “The challenge is that people want instant solutions. But according to studies 66 days or 10 weeks is the average time it takes for a person to adopt a new habit,” explains Juutilainen. “By nature people are other-directed, but we want to help them to become inner-directed. It means you’re directed by your own values instead of your environment.” While the required level of commitment is high, so are the claimed benefits. These vary from better self-awareness and stress management to improved decision making and handling of challenging situations. The Virtual Coach is mainly targeted at consumers and companies who want to invest in the long term wellbeing of their employees, as most of the exercises are designed to reflect real work life situations. Although the program is completely automated it can also be done with support from a real life coach. Professional coaches are provided with an online toolkit to monitor users’ progress and give feedback. Coaching and wellness services providers can also resell the virtual coaching program as part of their own service offering. “Currently the market is focused on measuring the body and there aren’t many services that are aimed to developing emotional life and cognitive skills. We offer a unique combination of mental fitness and soft skills training,” says Juutilainen. “There are similar services that offer reactive treatments [when problems have already appeared] but there isn’t anyone else on the preventive side.” In early April Newolo took on a new market and opened up the service for individual users. Anyone can sign-up and use the service for a fee. The company feels the market is only in its infancy as the importance of emotional skills in work life are becoming better known.  One sign of this is the German ZPP certificate Newolo received in July. It means the company’s services are recognised by the German health insurance system and Newolo has become the first Finnish company to attain it. The next step for Newolo is strengthening its partner network across Europe. The company, which employs 10 people in Finland, has resellers in Austria and Germany and is discussing with potential partners in the UK. “Western countries are our primary target market at the moment as it takes a lot more cultural localisation to go to Asia,” Juutilainen concludes. “But as a startup we have learnt to go where the markets are. There is no point setting our plans in stone.” “According to studies 85 to 95 per cent of illnesses originate mentally. We operate in the origin of wellbeing, the mental side. It has been scientifically proved that how we think has strong ties to our physical health,” says Newolo’s creative Director Juho Juutilainen."

The app emerged unexpectedly out of the shadows of Joiku Soft, a company that was established some eight years ago. “Joiku Soft was basically developing a solution where you share your Internet connection from your Nokia phone with other devices,” recalls CEO  . “As a result of sharing, we started collecting data regarding the connection, like the connection speed and amount of data transferred.” After accumulating a database consisting of nearly 250 000 base stations and their average speeds across various phones, Joiku Soft hit an insurmountable snag: Nokia was sold to Microsoft. Much like the signal when encountering a reception black spot their dream began to fade, as Microsoft turned its back on the Symbian-based technology that Joiku Speed had built its foundations upon. Joiku Speed is now broadening its focus and developing its user interface towards determining the overall quality of the network connections. “Basically what we had on our hands was an obsolete, or a very soon obsolete collection of data,” Kiuru explains. But, as the old adage repeatedly proves in the startup game, behind every failure resides an opportunity. The team at Joiku Soft soon realised they could still use the data to inform users of the fastest operators in their vicinity. Changing their name to Joiku Speed, they began focusing on measuring connection speeds for Android devices. Accessing more than one billion speed comparison data points from mobile users worldwide, Joiku Speed now covers hundreds of thousands of cell sites across all operator networks around the world. In its formative stage Joiku Speed also busied itself with fine-tuning its speed measurement technology alongside developing its business arm. However, they soon realised that they were in competition with a research team from Aalto University, whose Net Radar was proving to be a highly accurate and reliable speed monitor. “We made a quick comparison regarding the speeds that we were measuring against, then came to the conclusion that we don’t need to continue developing our own measurements,” Kiuru explains. “It is money better spent if we use that on innovating the business side.” The Joiku Speed service offers an easy avenue for operators to attract new subscribers and 4G upgrades, an approach that differentiates it from other speed-based applications. If a user happens to experience a lagging 3G network in a crowded area, for example, Joiku Speed steps in to assist. “We offer them a deal to switch to this operator right now and get a better device, so you won’t be facing connection issues any longer,” Kiuru states. Joiku Speed then receives compensation from the operator if the user decides to upgrade their service. The company is now also broadening its focus and developing its user interface towards determining the overall quality of the network connections. This change of tact holds the company in good stead in future. Mobile network authorities in the EU are currently mulling over implementing a directive that will enforce network quality assessment. “If this mobile network quality measurement becomes mandatory, we are in an excellent position to start discussions with half of the European operators,” Kiuru outlines. “The aim of the company is not to stay in Finland, but basically to offer this service European-wide.” If a user happens to experience a lagging 3G network, Joiku Speed offers a deal to switch to a better operator and get a better device."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-independent-music-heads-fullsteam-into-the-future/,Finnish independent music heads Fullsteam into the future,"Weathering the storm that has been battering the music industry in recent years, Fullsteam continues to defy and diversify. The name Tavastia is synonymous with quality music. Over the years, the Helsinki venue has hosted some of the biggest local and international acts, many when they were relatively unknown. Located in the heart of the city, its well-trodden stage has launched many aspiring performers into stardom. A similar story has been playing out six floors above this hallowed turf at the office of  . Emerging in 2002, the record company has grown to become one of the most successful independent labels in Finnish history. “We started out as a kind of do-it-yourself label,” explains  , Fullsteam Records’ head of international. “We have grown up to represent all sides of the Finnish music business and artists. Mostly we have been releasing bands that we felt had been ignored by the major labels.” Such ignorance has been bliss for the record-buying public. Some 200 albums have been added to their catalogue over the years, resulting in various plaques of recognition crowding the walls of the Fullsteam office. Their industry peers have also applauded the company’s efforts, deeming Fullsteam the Independent Record Company of the Year on nearly 10 occasions. Not a bad result for one that has only been around for 13 years. Much of the Fullsteam’s success during this time has come with an eye on other markets. “From the beginning it’s been about open mindedness and courage to reach out to international audiences,” Kilpeläinen states. “The label really had, and still has, big ambitions to produce bands that are popular worldwide and not just staying in our own corner of the world.” The post-hardcore/alternative rock of Disco Ensemble was the breakthrough act for Fullsteam onto the international arena. After their sophomore full-length made waves at home, the outfit was signed to Universal in Germany, the fourth-biggest music market in the world. Not a one trick pony; Fullsteam Records has grown up to represent all sides of the Finnish music business and artists. “That band made a lot of things possible for us,” Kilpeläinen recalls with a smile. “After that it was easier to sign new acts and grow.” Subsequent successes abroad have seen Central Europe, the UK and the Nordic countries developing into significant international markets for Fullsteam. Rather than stagnate in the digital age, Fullsteam has diversified into various channels of the music business. Thus, while the record industry drowns in cutbacks and downsizing, the number of Fullsteam staff continues to grow and currently stands at 35. “We don’t have to evolve very much in modern times, as we have already thought in much broader terms,” Kilpeläinen states. “Fullsteam has always done other stuff like bookings, merchandising and other areas of the music business.” This multifaceted business acumen has also rubbed off on many artists on the Fullsteam roster. “It’s not always easy to be a good artist and an entrepreneur,” Kilpeläinen observes. “But, some of the best bands are able to use both sides of their brain and are not only great artists but also smart entrepreneurs.” Management has been the most recent feather in Fullsteam’s musical cap. In contrast to the label’s humble beginnings, this time they started at the top by signing Finland’s most popular male and female artists,   and  . So, does this represent a mainstream change of focus for the company? “We are not a one genre, one trick pony,” Kilpeläinen emphasises. “There’s lots under the name of Fullsteam. We are still aiming to launch international careers as well as Finnish ones in Finland.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/3-step-it-finds-inspiration-in-circular-economy/,3 Step IT finds inspiration in circular economy,"The Finnish company 3 Step IT has rapidly expanded internationally and now they see new opportunities in innovative business models. I was intimidated by the coffee machine. It was brand new, with not even a fingerprint on its stainless steel surface. Unidentifiable spouts stuck out at odd angles and the screen displayed three different languages. “We just got these installed,” says  , the international sales director for  . 3 Step IT just moved into new offices close to the Helsinki shoreline. After Lampi pressed a couple of buttons we had fresh coffee and he gave a tour of their nautical-themed offices with a view of the Baltic. The company is growing rapidly and needed new space. In 2014 they surpassed 500 million euros in sales and 18 million in pre-tax profit. Even the financial crisis didn’t damper their growth. “Generally, in recessions companies make better choices about their costs,” Lampi explains. “We were also helped by market conditions, but our main advantage is that we have good people.” 3 Step IT helps companies manage their information technology. They lease their clients the equipment, manage it and then replace it, so the whole IT lifecycle is handled in three steps. It seems simple, but just like pressing a button on a coffee machine a lot is necessary to make it all run smoothly. “We operate in the Nordics, Baltics and UK,” says Lampi. “In 2011 we moved into Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Last year Asia already made up ten per cent of our turnover, and it is a huge growth market. It could make up 50 per cent by 2020.” The company participates in the circular economy, where resources are kept in circulation longer and new ways are found to recover and refurbish them. The year 2020 seems like the far-distant future for a technology business, but 3 Step IT is already planning. The industry is changing, like with the move to cloud-based software and services. The end user is also evolving, such as how people switch between desktops, smartphones and tablets as they work. There are also new ways for the company to do business. “The three steps are there, but we change and emphasise different things to better help the customer,” Lampi says. “For instance, in Finland we might expand services. Now in Islamic countries under Sharia law they don’t charge interest, so we are looking at Islamic leasing.” The company participates in the circular economy, where resources are kept in circulation longer and new ways are found to recover and refurbish them. Where up until recently society exploited resources, used them and then disposed of them, the new model emphasises reuse. “For example, let’s say a school in a developing country needs computers,” explains Lampi. “We could take old laptops from our clients, securely wipe the data and deliver the equipment to the school.” 3 Step IT already has three refurbishment centres in Britain, Finland and Sweden, and have a new one in Malaysia. Here their old leased equipment comes to be wiped and overhauled and then it is sold on to new customers. “This complete cycle is important to us. We are working with a Swedish university on it,” he concludes. “We have all the elements in place and all we need are the right partners.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/palodex-committed-to-the-path-of-continuous-improvement/,Palodex committed to the path of continuous improvement,"Finnish health technology and its success are gaining more and more coverage. However, recent innovations are not all there is to our expertise in this field: Finland has a track record of pioneering health and medical technology spanning decades. One of these success stories is Palodex Group. The municipality of Tuusula in Southern Finland is home to the world’s largest production unit specialising in the manufacture of devices for dental and head imaging. From there, imaging devices developed and manufactured by   are exported to 90 different countries. “Palodex was established in the 1960s to commercialise the panoramic X-ray device Orthopantomograph based on the invention of professor   and  , M. Sc (Eng.),” says vice president, CEO   from Palodex. “At that time, the company operated under the name Ruusuvaara. Over the years, the name has been changed to Palodex Group through various corporate transactions.” The Orthopantomograph imaging device is still in use. Almost everyone who has had their teeth X-rayed will be familiar with the panoramic dental image that it produces. Before the device was invented, X-ray images could only be taken of individual teeth or a part of the dental arch. The new invention made it possible to image the entire dental arch with just one rotation. Vice President, CEO Tiina Holkko says that product development is based on the needs of experts, such as dentists and radiographers Today, Orthopantomograph is a registered trademark of Palodex Group. The device was originally designed for the global markets. Even today, around 70 per cent of Palodex’s turnover is based on this panoramic technology. However, the company also manufactures a number of other products related to dental imaging. They are divided under two brands. The Instrumentarium Dental brand includes high-end devices that are usually intended for fairly demanding expert applications. The Soredex brand, on the other hand, includes mid-market imaging devices that are targeted at larger customer groups. “We rely on distribution channels, which means we do not sell our products directly to hospitals or dental clinics, for example,” Holkko says. “However, dentists and other specialists are strongly involved in our product development. We want to develop products specifically for their needs.” Since 2009, Palodex has been part of the U.S. Danaher Group. However, this has not in any way affected the company’s operations: product development and manufacturing still take place in Finland. All in all, Palodex currently employs 400 people in Finland. In the field of dental imaging, Palodex is one of the top five companies worldwide. The nets cast out on the global markets through the Orthopantomograph have resulted in a good catch: 99 per cent of the company’s turnover currently comes from exports. “We are represented in almost all parts of the world, with the exception of Central Africa. Our major markets include, for example, Europe and North America, but also many Asian countries,” Holkko says. Palodex’s roots are deeply planted in revolutionising dental imaging, and the company has grown through its innovations. From the analog Orthopantomograph, Palodex has made it all the way to today’s cone-beam computed tomography devices for 3D images. According to Holkko, Palodex’s goal is to be the number one expert in head imaging, whose products can be used in both dental clinics and hospitals. The company follows the philosophy of continuous improvement, which leaves no room for it to deviate from the path of innovative product development. Almost everyone who has had their teeth X-rayed will be familiar with the panoramic dental image produced by the Orthopantomograph imaging device."

This new travel app solves that problem, helping to guide the world off the well-trodden path. It wasn’t that long ago that travel meant worrying about how to fold your map back into its correct configuration without ripping the edges. Nowadays the biggest concern is whether your smart device has enough battery to power your travel-related apps for a full day of sightseeing. Stepping into the innovative travel arena populated by the likes of Airbnb is  . The basic premise of the service is simple, yet has that particular familiarity that surrounds all great ideas. Here, locals in cities around the world offer tours of their hometown, tailored to particular hobbies and themes. Want to investigate abandoned buildings in Helsinki? Well, you’re in luck. How about a ‘boat crawl’ along the finest watering holes lining Amsterdam’s canals? Easily done. Fancy some tips from a Paris fashionista? All with a flick of the thumb. “Ventoura is a mix of social discovery and sharing economy, trying to make travel more of an experience rather than just ‘where you are’,” explains Ventoura’s CEO  . “Experiential travel is quite a hot topic right now.” It seems appropriate then for the company to emerge in Finland, the global hotbed for startups. However, unlike the lion’s share of up-and-coming businesses based here, the idea first took root on the other side of the world, in Australia. Get a local as your travel guide! Through Ventoura it’s possible to get a tailored tour to particular hobbies and themes, hosted by a local. “It was conceived from our passion for travel and experiences around Europe as backpackers, and finding it was very easy to go to a city and only scratch the surface,” Siems explains. “We realised if we wanted to take our idea seriously we needed to get an investor to make it possible. At that point we started to look beyond Australian shores.” Given the global reputation of the startup scene here, it was a natural step to pitch their idea to a Finnish private venture capitalist. Ventoura’s potential was immediate.Soon the team was packing their bags and moving to Helsinki, with 250 000 US dollars in seed funding in their back pockets. Now headquartered in the Finnish capital, Ventoura also has offices in Shanghai and Australia. This international reach is reflected in the cultural makeup of the company. Siems himself is a British national, and is joined by Finns, Australians, Chinese and a New Zealander. “For a travel company it makes a lot of sense to have heritage from all over,” Siems states. The most recent addition to the crew has been the Finnish marketing team, bringing with them the pragmatism for which Finns are so renowned. “They have a really good work ethic and are not afraid to speak their mind,” Siems observes. “If you work with someone in a startup you should say what you think, as time is of the essence.” The international group has settled in well in Finland. In this time Siems has been impressed by the support received from the local business community, pointing to the good mentorship opportunities in particular. He is equally enthusiastic about what lies ahead. Currently offering tours in 12 European cities, Ventoura is looking to expand this number to up to 50 by the year’s end. “It’s hard to compare reading a guidebook as opposed to actually meeting a local and seeing their home through their eyes,” Siems enthuses. “Once people try Ventoura it will change the way they travel.” “Ventoura is a mix of social discovery and sharing economy, trying to make travel more of an experience rather than just ‘where you are’,” explains Ventoura’s CEO Raymond Siems."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/solar-films-energises-the-finnish-movie-business/,Solar Films energises the Finnish movie business,"Some of the most popular films in Finland’s cinematic history have been released by this Helsinki production company. When international cinemagoers collectively sit down with a box of popcorn over the next year, at least two significant films made in Finland will be among the global offering. On the one hand is  ’s  . Based on    ’s popular novels, the comedy has already become the second-most watched movie in Finland of the past quarter-century. On the other, somewhat scalier, hand is  , the quintet of metal music-loving Jurassic lizards that has evolved into something of a phenomenon. Interest in the band stretches all the way to Australia, and crowds of children eagerly await their recently completed debut feature. The common link between these two movies is  , the Finnish production house that is celebrating 20 years in the business this year. The studio has enjoyed unprecedented success over the years, producing the top three most-popular domestic films of all time. This impressive result is in keeping with their straightforward philosophy. “We are trying to entertain people and produce films that people want to see,” explains Solar Films’ managing director  . “That has been the goal since we started.” Alongside Solar Films’ extraordinary homegrown success, their output has also enjoyed significant international exposure over the past two decades. Alongside their extraordinary homegrown success, Solar Films’ output has also enjoyed significant international exposure over the past two decades. “Most of the films we have produced are sold aboard,” Helle states. “  (2005) by   was sold to UK, Germany and France.   (2012) by   was also successful. Also, the early films of ours, for example,   (2000) – we sold it to at least 25 countries.” promises to have a similar reach. Companies in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Canada, Portugal, Estonia, Lithuania and Turkey have already acquired theatrical rights to the film. “The humour of   is quite unique, but still the plot and the mentality of the main character is quite global,” Helle says.“Most people outside of Finland know somebody who has that attitude.” The international marketplace has become increasingly crowded since Solar Films first emerged. This added competitiveness has seen the studio attempt to differentiate its output in a number of ways. One of these has been bringing some of Finland’s biggest bands to the big screen. Both  (2008) and   (2012) were Solar Films productions. The latter was also notable in that is was co-produced with Canadian studio Caramel Films. The acclaimed adaptation of  ’s award-winning novel   also hit screens the same year, which in turn became one of three Solar Films offerings to have been selected as Finland’s official entry for the Academy Awards. It too was produced in collaboration with a foreign studio, Estonia’s Taska Film. Solar Films and Canadian studio Caramel Films brought Finnish band Nightwish to the big screen with Imaginaerum by Nightwish in 2012. “There are certain ways to go about getting an international audience and one is co-productions,” Helle states. “We actively seek them. It has been our strategy over the last five-to-seven years. We have co-produced seven films with The Icelandic Film Company and we were also a part of  , which was their entry for the Oscars last year.” The benefit of pooling resources with foreign studios is twofold, providing an increase in funding and international distribution for both production houses. And with the Finnish and Icelandic companies also sharing a producing credit on  , the curtain won’t be going down on such lucrative international collaboration anytime in the near future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/power-engineers-boosts-renewable-energy-drive-with-finnish-expansion/,Power Engineers boosts renewable energy drive with Finnish expansion,"Engineering consulting services firm Power Engineers has been managing projects worldwide since it began in a small town in 1976. Now the US company is strengthening its European presence by investing in a growing subsidiary in Finland. The Idaho-based Power Engineers has been working in the Nordic region for the past 15 years, but has expanded to offer its Northern customers a more local touch. The company’s first subsidiary in Northern Europe,  , opened its doors in Finnish capital Helsinki last summer. “Our geographical name could actually be ‘Power Engineers Northern Europe’,” says  , senior project manager at the Finnish subsidiary. “We operate in the whole Northern region which starts from Finland and covers Scandinavia, the Baltic states and selected Eastern Europe countries.” Like its mother company, Power Engineers Finland is purely a consulting services and engineering design specialist which means it offers engineering planning, design and program management services across multiple industries. No machinery or hardware manufacturing here. The Finnish offshoot has specialised in the energy sector from the start, particularly wind power and wind farms. Lately it has also seen a boost in demand for grid and power station planning as well as process planning in the food industry. US-based consulting engineering firm Power Engineers established a subsidiary in Finland to grow its presence in the Nordics, Baltics and selected Eastern European countries. Currently Power Engineers Finland serves a handful of Nordic customers with a team of three full time and four project employees. As the Northern European base, Power Engineers Finland is also supported by its parent company’s 2 300 global staff and approximately 40 offices in the US, UK and South Africa. Haapanen believes the combination of local and global expertise is a good base for controlled and steady growth. “So far everything has gone as planned. We have started with a relatively low profile and small scale, but the aim is to grow our personnel together with our workload and projects,” Haapanen explains. “As a global company we can bring a slightly different angle and transfer our experience to the local market. We have stepped into quite a few pitfalls around the world which means we can avoid them here and not make the same mistakes again.” What attracted Power Engineers to set up the subsidiary in Finland was a combination of finding the right people, strong demand in the area and a geographically suitable location for the company’s growth plans. “This [Finland] is a safe region in the sense that there’s lot of development happening here, especially in renewable energy,” Haapanen says. “We saw this as a good time to start. We can offer planning and support locally, companies don’t have to go outside the country borders to look for it.” What Haapanen also thinks does not work is over reliance on a single energy form. Consequently Power Engineers Finland is already looking ahead to the development of, among others, solar power as the technology behind wind energy starts to mature: “Wind energy is slowly getting to the point where, while its development continues, it doesn’t continue at the same scale as now. We’ll reach the 2020 target [2,500 MVA] and start to develop new renewable solutions vigorously,” Haapanen explains. “Solar is one upcoming area. It’s one of our areas of expertise and we’ll definitely be involved in it also in Finland and the Nordic region.” Established in July 2014, the Helsinki-based Power Engineers Finland acts as the Northern European base for Power Engineers, a US consulting services and engineering firm. Haapanen also stresses the company’s interest in further development of power grids and the renewal needs of existing transmission and distribution grids. Answering future needs will mean further growth of the company’s operations in the Nordic region. While the Helsinki office will stay as its headquarters, Power Engineers Finland has expansion plans which include setting up local offices in nearby countries and potentially in different parts of Finland. “In five years our goal is to be present in at least some of the neighbouring countries. Also our operations in Finland, our headquarters in the region, will have grown either organically or through acquisitions,” Haapanen concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-eateries-serve-it-up-globally/,Finnish eateries serve it up globally,"The last five years have seen a phenomenal shift in the Finnish culinary scene, with Michelin-starred establishments and a burgeoning street food scene satiating a variety of palates. Now these tastes are heading abroad, from the top shelf to the street. In 2003, Chez Dominique became the first restaurant in Finland to receive two Michelin stars, a revered stamp of approval the fine dining establishment held on to until eventually closing its doors 10 years later. Its influence on the local culinary scene was unprecedented, yet it was also in its kitchen where the next stage of dining in Finland was born, thanks to two of its former chefs. “When we opened in August 2009 there weren’t many believers in our concept,” explains  , who owns and operates modern Asian restaurant   in Helsinki with . “It actually took off very quickly; it didn’t take many weeks for customers to find us and to be doing a full dining room basically every night.” A change of faith was rapid among their fellow restaurateurs, as flavoursome dishes served in a relaxed environment swiftly became the local culinary benchmark. “Farang is a concept that is strong enough to be taken anywhere. Obviously there are plenty of interesting cities: London, New York, Sydney. Right now they are ideas, but everything else has started just from ideas,” says Farang’s co-owner Matti Wikberg. Rather than rest on their laurels, subsequent years have seen Wikberg and Björck establish a further four restaurants. However, when Farang opened its doors in Sweden in 2013, the duo’s trend-setting upped the stakes to unprecedented levels. “Going abroad was always an idea that we had since the beginning,” Wikberg states. “I thought it would be a good challenge and interesting to do. Stockholm was a natural choice, being close by and having a very similar culture.” Turning the tables on the typical industry trend where new culinary discoveries are often made in Stockholm and then brought to Finland, the Finnish duo successfully imported a fresh idea to Sweden. Actually, scratch that – the response to Farang has been… “Phenomenal could be the right word,” Wikberg exclaims, with a smile. Resultant great word-of-mouth has since seen the duo mulling over bringing another of their Helsinki-based restaurants to Stockholm. But why stop there. “Farang is a concept that is strong enough to be taken anywhere. Obviously there are plenty of interesting cities: London, New York, Sydney. Right now they are ideas, but everything else has started just from ideas.” Farang’s cocktail of tantalising taste buds in a casual setting also quickly filtered down to Helsinki’s street level. Opening its doors in 2012,  ’s serves fresh and fast takes on falafel in a stylish setting. Its bright interior resembling a beacon of light and quality amidst a sea of greasy spoon ventures, customers have responded in their droves. Together with a trio of Finnish investors, Israeli expat   has gone on to open a further three Fafa’s in the capital city to meet demand. Given its success, one might assume the next logical step for Fafa’s would be national expansion. But Karavani has bigger plans on the menu. “We have such a good product and it’s very international,” he explains. “We want to take it outside. Copenhagen was the first place that interested me.” Opening in March, Fafa’s Copenhagen employs exactly the same concept: fresh ingredients served in pleasant surrounds in a manner far removed from pretentiousness. Mirroring Fafa’s Helsinki success is just the beginning – Karavani is aiming for up to 10 establishments in the Danish capital. Unsurprisingly, given his restless ambition, this is merely the tip of the culinary iceberg. “London would be a challenge,” he states. “I want to build a business that will last for years.” Finnish Farang opened its doors in Sweden in 2013 and the response to has been phenomenal."

Typically a high-tech startup will run big losses while they try to build up their business. Lead Desk, however, was already profitable in its first full year of operations in 2010 and is still going strong. “We have had a strong first quarter with continued sales growth across the Nordic markets, Germany and Poland, and we have started to bring customers on board in the Benelux region,” says LeadDesk CEO  . “We also announced Series A investment at the end of February, which is an important milestone for us.” LeadDesk is an expert in software for call centres, inside sales and telemarketing operations. Each week they handle over three million calls for customers as diverse as the staffing company Manpower and the media company Otava. In February 2015 Lead Desk raised 5.5 million euros in funding which will assist in their international expansion. “The telesales software industry typically consists of smaller local players that are not able to provide the level of integration, sophistication and quality of service that customers need,” says Nokso-Koivisto. “Then larger multinational IT companies offer solutions that are tied to costly and inflexible legacy hardware infrastructure.” In this era of advertising oversaturation it is becoming increasingly important for companies to be able to directly reach potential customers. Nokso-Koivisto points to their predictive dialer technology as one of LeadDesk’s advantages. Another is that they are based in the Cloud, so there is no need for costly hardware. “LeadDesk is not just a telesales software solution,” Nokso-Koivisto explains. “We also offer operator services, such as Voice over Internet Protocol accounts, and contacts data services like lead lists. This combination is unique and helps call centres of all sizes to decrease costs and increase productivity.” The business of calling customers is strictly regulated in many markets, so they must meet local requirements. One example he cites is Norway, where they developed a two-way SMS feature for instant deal confirmation. They have also built up an ecosystem around their product. Partners can help provide advanced e-signing, gamification, voice analysis and online marketing tracking. In February 2015 the company raised 5.5 million euros in funding which will assist in their international expansion. “We look at various criteria when selecting new markets to enter,” Nokso-Koivisto continues. “The profile of the contact centre industry, size of call centres, level of outsourcing and numbers of agents are all important. Local sales and telesales culture is also important, as is the relative sophistication of the market and level of adoption of new technologies.” He mentions the UK, Ireland and Spain as other growth markets, but even the existing Finnish market has a lot of potential. Lead Desk has good relationships with the domestic telesales industry and they find Finland a good pilot market. “We have access to a fantastic developer talent pool in Finland and we get great support and advice from Finnish associations such as Finpro, Finnvera, Tekes and Finnish Industrial Investment,” says Nokso-Koivisto. “The reputation of Finland and Finnish companies for trustworthiness, technological expertise and straight talking helps, too.” Each week LeadDesk handles over three million calls for customers as diverse as the staffing company Manpower and the media company Otava."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/musopia-makes-mobile-apps-for-wannabe-guitar-heroes/,Musopia makes mobile apps for wannabe guitar heroes,"What do the guitar, ukulele, phone camera and karaoke have in common? In this case, Finnish startup Musopia. After three successful mobile apps that make it easier to play the guitar or the ukulele, the startup is now bringing music into our smartphone videos. Helsinki-based   develops music apps that make it easier to learn to play and enjoy music. No more frustration over not being able to play songs you actually like. “As much as 85 per cent of people who start to play the guitar let it go because they can’t get past the first stage [of learning the chords],” says  , CMO at Musopia. “Our number one goal is to help people start jamming and to play their own favourite songs as soon as possible.” To achieve this goal, the startup has so far released three mobile apps. The first, guitar karaoke  , offers an easy way to play guitar songs, its sister app   promises to do the same for ukulele players and   helps people learn guitar chords. Behind the idea of simplified ways of playing music is Musopia’s founder and avid heavy metal guitarist  . After selling his maintenance company, Löppönen set up a competition to crowdsource music-related business ideas in 2011. Musopia was founded the same year around the winning idea (an early version of FourChords) which was released internationally a year later. Today the company has six employees, has raised 660 000 euros in funding, partners with guitar manufacturer Samick and has had it apps downloaded over 1.5 million times. Musopia’s CMO Paula Lehto and Topi Löppönen showcased their mobile apps in the US at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. There are no shortage of mobile apps that teach you how to play an instrument, but Musopia has a few aces up its sleeve. First of all, users get to play their favourite tracks from the start because, as implied by the title, most songs in FourChords and Ukeoke can be played using just four chords. “We have re-arranged the songs and created much simpler new versions,” Lehto explains. “The whole songbook of 1 000 tracks can be played through using only 11 chords in total. After you learn those chords, you can play all the songs in the app. Traditionally you would need hundreds of chords to do the same.” In addition the songs, which vary from current hits to gospel, are displayed karaoke-style with acoustic backing tracks and song lyrics to guide the player. This also enables jamming in a group as the chords, shown as icons, and the lyrics are displayed simultaneously on the same screen. Around half Musopia’s users are from the US, with other English-speaking countries such as the UK, Canada and Australia following close behind. Interestingly the company has particularly struck a chord with women. “Almost of half of our users are women. In general 10-15 per cent of all guitar players are women,” Lehto says. It remains to be seen whether women will also embrace Musopia’s next endeavour. The upcoming app, at the moment called a ‘Musical Camera’, is scheduled for soft launch later this spring and uses an unique algorithm to compose music for videos being shot on mobile. “We haven’t seen anyone do something like this before. You can use the app to shoot a video and the app will simultaneously compose a soundscape based on what it sees. Colours, shadows and movement help to form the soundscape,” Lehto explains. “You can just listen to what the scenery sounds like or you can record the soundscape together with the video.” For Musopia it’s a step towards building a whole family of music related mobile apps. But there is one thing the startup won’t compromise: enjoying music must always be at their core."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-robots-test-devices-for-global-mobile-giants/,Finnish robots test devices for global mobile giants,"Do you own a touchscreen device? Chances are it has been tested by Finnish human simulator robots. Imagine a robotic arm shaking and rotating a smartphone and using it with mechanical fingers to simulate how a real person would use their phone. Machine vision monitors the screen while several sensors measure accuracy and response times of the user interface. This is what a typical testing system looks like at Finnish technology company  . Since 2005 the Tampere-based company has been providing some of the biggest handset, computer and car manufacturers with lifelike user experience and performance testing. In fact, Optofidelity is one of the global leaders (or the leader, if you ask the company) in robotic user interface testing systems for touch devices. “Out of the ten largest mobile phone companies, eight are our customers and have purchased our testing technology inside the past two years,” says  , CEO of Optofidelity. “Most of them are based in the US and some in Asia.” Optofidelity’s technology detects audio, visual and haptic events. It can be used for example to test how device performance changes during different product development phases as well as to expose potentially costly faults before devices end up in the hands of consumers. While Optofidelity cannot reveal much about its clientele, it can name one: China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator. Not bad for a company which in the past 18 months has grown from 21 employees to over 50 and opened its first office abroad in Silicon Valley, California. The secret of Optofidelity’s success lies in a unique combination of machine vision, robotics and cognitive measurement software. This helps to speed up customers’ R&D processes as the automated test system can be used throughout the product development phase to simulate real-life user experiences. Unlike people, robots won’t get tired or slow even if tests are repeated for hours on end. Optofidelity wants to be close to its customers. Its robotics testing systems are primarily assembled and tested in Finland with partner assembly facilities already in China and Taiwan and a US partner facility will be added soon. “The best product quality, end-user satisfaction and faster time to market can be guaranteed only with automated end-to-end testing,” explains Aimonen. “The testing philosophy of Optofidelity is to test devices with a robot which simulates human behavior. You can define your own test cases, simulate long term product use and catch sensor and software faults before products are released to the market.” When Optofidelity first started, it focused on R&D consulting and customer specific testing, which it still offers for its home market in Finland. But the company soon realised that to conquer global markets it needed to translate its expertise into products. Consequently Optofidelity’s first robotics testing system was introduced internationally in 2010. Today the company has a test robot concept for any touch enabled device, be it a small wearable with curved display or a huge touch wall. The change of direction has payed off. Last year alone, Optofidelity saw its turnover to grow by more than 60 per cent. Around 80 per cent of the company’s products are exported, mainly to the US and Asia, and used throughout the electronics industry from component manufacturers to operators. “Nobody else offers the same combination where you can integrate, for example, component validation and performance measurements into the same system. The versatility of our products is a major advantage,” Aimonen says. The fast changing world of technology means Optofidelity is never standing still. It invests heavily in adapting its technology to the latest t esting trends, whether it is curved displays, 3D imaging, gesture control or communication between devices, such as a smartphone and a smart watch. And we aren’t only talking about phones and tablets. The latest addition to Optofidelity’s customer base is the automotive industry. Car dashboards today not only have touchscreens, but can have gesture and voice control or offer advanced integration with smartphones. It all starts to sound more like science fiction than the real world. “The current trend is machine to machine communication. There will also be lots of new control methods and the number of sensors in devices is growing. The industry leaders test and validate more components and end-products and faster than ever before,” says Aimonen. “At the same time, devices are very complex and product recall costs are high. There is growing demand for our testing technology as devices get more complicated.” It looks like Optofidelity’s robots won’t be booking their holidays anytime soon."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/team-rokka-works-its-animal-magic-2/,Team Rokka works its animal magic,"Dogs trained by Finnish NGO Team Rokka are playing an important role in fighting poaching and illegal trafficking in endangered species. Trafficking in wildlife is the fourth biggest global criminal activity, after drugs, weapons and people. The rate at which elephants in Africa are being slaughtered for their tusks, for example, means that the species will become extinct by 2025. Preventing this traffic requires concerted and innovative efforts, and the role played by Team Rokka’s trained detection dogs is an effective addition to the anti-trafficking arsenal. “Our dogs are trained to detect concealed ivory and firearms and they can be used to assist local law enforcement authorities in their operations against poachers and ivory trafficking syndicates,” says Team Rokka’s founder Toni Lahtinen.  was set up by former Finnish policeman   in 2012 in a bid to apply his own professional dog-handling skills to anti-poaching activities in eastern Africa. “Since I was a kid my biggest passion has been helping animals in every way I can,” explains Lahtinen. “Even when I was in the police I asked to use more time for animal welfare inspections and cruelty investigations, as well as networking between other animal welfare authorities and NGOs.” After leaving the police in 2010, he worked as a volunteer at animal rescue shelters in Romania and Thailand and as a kennel manager for the RSPCA ACT shelter in Australia. “Tanzania is the priority now and it will take time to get things going there. But as soon as possible, and when we have raised the needed funds, we would like to expand our work in other African countries on other continents wherever our expertise might be needed to save wildlife.” The current pilot project, in cooperation with the PAMS Foundation in Tanzania, is all about detection dogs, says Lahtinen. “Our dogs are trained to detect concealed ivory and firearms and they can be used to assist local law enforcement authorities in their operations against poachers and ivory trafficking syndicates. Assisting means searching for and detecting the stashes that would be missed otherwise.” The huge demand for ivory in Asian markets needs to be tackled, and people need to be made aware that they do not actually need ivory for anything, Lahtinen stresses. “Also, all possible action needs to be taken to tackle corruption holding back effective, wildlife related law enforcement work.”"

Online live-chat provider Finnchat has grown from three people to dozens, and now it’s trying to – literally – spread the word in the international market, too. Shopping online can sometimes be frustrating. Is this product better than the other? Why does this cost more than that? Where do I find information about delivery costs?     ”Unfortunately many Finnish companies choose to stay in the domestic market, and if they go abroad, the volume is small. That’s why we lack international success stories,” says CEO of Finnchat Roope Rämänen. supported by the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, and Finnchat was also made part of the Young Innovative Companies programme by Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes. “The core idea was that although business is moving online, shopping doesn’t need to be all technology.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-future-looks-crowded-for-invesdor/,The future looks crowded for Invesdor,"Finnish crowdfunding platform has the EU – and the world – in its sights. Grab the bull by the horns. Hitting the bull’s eye. Like a bull at a gate. Given the number of similar idioms that apply to the fortunes of debt and equity crowdfunding platform  , it seems appropriate that the company’s mascot is a bull. Oh, and it’s also fitting that crowdfunding is one of the hottest bull markets globally right now, tripling in size last year alone to become a 16 billion-US dollar industry. “Crowdfunding is a digitalisation of the financing process,” states  , Invesdor’s co-founder and CEO. “Now, basically anybody around the world can invest through our platform and companies can target a much wider audience internationally.” Invesdor’s chief key to success is derived from transcending crowdfunding’s marketing tool confines. Here monies are collected from investors before each offering closes, rather than waiting and statistically losing up to 40 per cent of the initial investment due to lagging interest. “We have copied this model from what’s been happening in an IPO process in the stock exchange,” Mäkelä explains. “In the largest case we had, there was only one person out of 780 who didn’t want to pay.” This secure professionalism has seen Invesdor attract more than 60 per cent market share in Finland in three years. The variety of growth companies and entrepreneurs participating is widespread: the film  , football club HIFK Fotboll, storage company Cityvarasto and local restaurants are just some to have successfully raised funds. “Crowdfunding is a democratisation of the financing process,” states Lasse Mäkelä, Invesdor’s co-founder and CEO. More than 500 companies have applied to Invesdor, of which 95 have opened their rounds. Some 38 of these have been successful, raising more than 6.5 million euros in total. And the figure keeps growing. The first wave of Invesdor’s expansion saw it claim a 46 per cent share of the Nordic market. The next step is Europe. As of April this year, Invesdor can now operate freely in all 31 EU and EEA countries. It is the first crowdfunding platform to have been granted a fully passportable MiFID licence for investment advice, reception and transmission of orders and placing of financial instruments, enabling it to accept target companies from across the continent. However, in order to maintain Invesdor’s high quality of service, European companies will be subject to the same stringent selection process before receiving the green light. “We do our own due diligence,” Mäkelä outlines. “We check the backgrounds of the company, credit ratings and so on. If there are some issues or problems we have to say no.” Not content with transforming the industry by facilitating investment from the comfort of your couch, Mäkelä also has bigger plans in the works. “There are three things we are planning to do,” Mäkelä explains. “First is international expansion. Second is launching our crowd bond product, a loan instrument which has an aftermarket. The third thing is a service concept where we can actually sell turnkey solutions for our business customers.” Streamlining efficiency is paramount for the Invesdor delivery channel, affording the opportunity to sidestep bankers and lawyers and simply get down to business. “We are like the Uber of fundraising, that is what we are targeting,” Mäkelä states."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/eur-1-8-million-financing-kick-starts-asqella-s-imaging-technology/,EUR 1.8 million financing kick starts Asqella’s imaging technology,"Internal theft is one the major causes for loss in retail. But not for long, if you ask Finnish technology company Asqella. Helsinki-based startup   has high expectations for 2015. The company recently secured a 1.8 million-euro financing round led by Finland’s VTT Ventures and angel investors and joined by China’s Shenzhen Lietou Fund (under Shenzhen Leaguer Venture Capital). And this is before the company even has a product on the market. “We are developing a globally unique imaging technology,” says Asqella’s co-founder and CEO  . “For the past year we have been working on taking the technology from research prototypes to commercial products. Now the international launch of our camera starts to be very close… and the new funding round makes it possible.” Asqella claims to be the first company in the world to offer ‘passive multi-band terahertz imaging systems for security screening applications’. That is the technical description, but in short the company has created a unique security camera technology for loss prevention and physical security applications. This technology makes it possible to screen large numbers of people for concealed items swiftly and with minimal inconvenience. The camera works like an advanced thermal camera which makes it both a safe and non-intrusive method. “Ours is a passive camera. We don’t radiate people with anything but instead detect photons that people naturally emit. Since there isn’t any radiation, our technology doesn’t cause any health risks either,” explains Luukanen. “Also the camera doesn’t reveal any intimate details of people. It only shows the silhouette of a person and any hidden objects as visible as contrast differences in the image.“ While some of the parts come from abroad, Asqella’s security screening cameras are manufactured in Finland using a wide network of subcontractors. Although security screening is often associated with airports, Asqella is tapping into two megatrends: growth of online retailers and urbanisation. In retail distribution centres Asqella’s technology can be used to replace traditional loss prevention and screening methods. Where security gates and manual checks are often labour intensive, slow and potentially unpleasant for the employees, Asqella’s cameras are not. For example they can be placed to point a door and screen people while they normally walk through the area. No walking through security portals or queuing for body checks. Similarly, the cameras can be used in cities in public buildings and big events to ensure no potentially dangerous items are brought to the area. This approach has international appeal. Asqella, established in 2013 as a spin-off company from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, already has potential pilot customers ready in Finland and abroad. In addition, its first funding round of roughly one million euros was joined by a Singaporean angel investor and the latest round incorporated a Chinese investment fund, Shenzhen Leaguer Venture Capital. No surprise then that the company, which also works with a wide network of subcontractors, is looking to expand its six member team and hire at least two new employees to speed up its market entry. While Asqella is first eyeing the North American and European markets, its new investors offer a valuable stepping stone in addressing the Asian market, notably China. “In the future China can be one of our biggest markets,” Luukanen says. “The pace of urbanisation in China remains unparalleled. Both of our target markets, loss prevention and physical security, are very important there.” Asqella’s success in China came via contacts within its existing network of stakeholders. But despite the geographical distance, Luukanen doesn’t see any major differences in the funding processes in Asia and Europe. “Of course it takes meetings, travelling to the country and meeting people in person, but we didn’t see that decision making would have been slower in China than Europe. The process was very straightforward and goes through the typical steps,” explains Luukanen. “These new investors have brought great expertise to our board which help especially with entering that market.” Luukanen admits China is not an easy market for a small Finnish company to crack and, while Asqella itself doesn’t yet have operations in the country, he gives one key piece of advice: get a local business partner. “We can’t open the market alone which is why we are planning to partner with suitable local operators. Plans are already in progress but we can’t reveal them yet,” Luukanen teases. Asqella is also not excluding the potential of working with organisations such as the ‘China Finland Golden Bridge Innovation Center’. An organisation aimed at improving business cooperation and innovation exchanges between Chinese and Finnish hi-tech companies and investors. But that stage will come later. For now, Asqella’s main focus in on bringing its camera to the international market. The big reveal is not far away — if you excuse the pun. Asqella hopes its technology changes the game in loss prevention and physical security by introducing a fast, cost-effective and non-intrusive method for people screening."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/720-degrees-improves-workspaces-through-measurements/,720 Degrees improves workspaces through measurements,"Finnish startup 720 Degrees has set out to tackle problems in indoor environmental quality at workplaces, which have a direct impact on the wellbeing of employees and thus their performance. The objective is to collect and analyse data based on which companies can carry out investments to improve the workspace. The CEO of  ,  , had a company in his home country, the Czech Republic, which offered various indoor air solutions to people with allergies or asthma. Some of these customers contacted Novotny later to ask if the company could also convince their employers that improving indoor air at workplaces is a win-win situation: it makes employees feel better and company gains productivity. After starting his studies at Aalto University in Finland, Novotny continued to reflect on the theme with his fellow students: How to convince companies that it pays off to develop the workplace indoor environment. Eventually, a company named 720 Degrees was established around the idea in 2012. “We realised along the way that workplaces do not pose challenges only to people with asthma or allergies. A number of factors in the indoor environment impact each and every employee’s wellbeing and performance,” explains Novotny. 720 Degrees offers indoor environmental quality monitoring services. A measuring device is installed at the workplace with sensors that monitor the environment. The measurement results are transmitted to a system that can be monitored by the company management or the building owners. In addition, the same data is transmitted to tablets found in the communal workplace areas. They allow the employees to monitor the results while also giving feedback based on their own observations, such as fatigue or dry eyes. The 720 Degrees tool provides real time information on indoor air quality. “We haven’t come across a similar service that combines continuous indoor space monitoring with psychosocial feedback from employees,” says the company’s COO  . “There are many companies specialising in indoor air measurementss but traditionally they only focus on chemical problems in the indoor air. Our service helps to exclude these problems if needed and to look at other aspects in order to identify the reasons behind the employees’ wellbeing issues.” Aller points out that 720 Degrees always performs its indoor environment measurements according to customers’ needs. Some are interested in indoor air quality, others in, for example, noise levels. In practice, the company thus offers a single tool that can be used to measure a variety of factors. According to the company, the service has sparked a lot of interest. In addition to Finland, it has customers in the Czech Republic and the first pilot projects are starting up in Sweden. “We have also carried out market research in China and the United States,” says Aller. “The latter seems a highly potential market for us, as it faces similar challenges as Finland does.” 720 Degrees sells its services directly to businesses, but sometimes also to building owners. Direct sales to corporate customers is a more logical approach, as companies bear their personnel costs themselves, unlike building owners who do not have a budget for the employees of the companies that occupy their premises. Thanks to 720 Degrees, companies can focus on the right challenges and thus invest in the wellbeing of their employees, which has a direct impact on performance. The tablets located in the communal workplace areas also allow the employees to monitor indoor environment data. 720 Degrees operates in the GE Health Innovation Village, home to a number of healthcare sector startups, located in Vallila, Helsinki. “This ecosystem brings us a myriad of advantages. GE Healthcare offers visibility and assistance to the startups that operate in the village. The company was already our customer, which is one reason why we moved here,” says Aller. Novotny is full of praise for the Finnish startup ecosystem in general: “That was the reason why I stayed in Finland. When I came here to study, the startup environment was only just beginning to take shape. Back then, I already noticed that people here are very excited about new things. Finns are very future-oriented. This mentality, combined with the help that startups receive from many quarters, has undoubtedly been essential during the first steps of our company as well.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-innovation-takes-the-treatment-of-strokes-to-a-new-level/,Finnish innovation takes the treatment of strokes to a new level,"Nexstim is a medical technology company whose Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) technology is unique in the world. NBS can help revolutionise rehabilitation for stroke patients. According to traditional thinking, stroke patients can reach 95 per cent of their maximum recovery level only within the first three months of treatment.  ’s research has proved, however, that patients undergoing rehabilitation can make good improvements even after those first three months –  but it takes more than just physiotherapy and occupational therapy. That’s where Nexstim’s NBS technology comes in. The basic idea is to stimulate the brain so that the patient receives greater benefits from physiotherapy. The patient’s brain is stimulated for 17 minutes, followed by around 60 minutes of physiotherapy. The brain reacts better to therapy after stimulation. “With our technology, we do not implant anything in the patients – the device does not puncture the skin,” says Nexstim’s CEO,  . “Thus, there is no pain involved – many patients even sleep during the 17-minute procedure.” This type of treatment is the first of its kind in the world for stroke patients. The only options available have been physio- and occupational therapy, which have produced rather weak results in stroke patients after the initial three months of therapy. Nexstim, therefore, has no real competitor in the field. The basic idea of the NBS-technology is to stimulate the brain so that the patient receives greater benefits from physiotherapy. In practice, NBS technology stimulates neurons in the cerebral cortex using an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field created by the device is the minimum able to stimulate the neurons. This, in itself, is nothing new in neuroscience. The novelty of Nexstim lies in its precision. With NBS technology, stimulation can be targeted with millimetre precision in the desired spot and at the desired dose. According to Huhtala, no other company has been able to provide proof of such precise brain stimulation. There are already 120 pieces of equipment based on Nexstim’s NBS technology in universities and university hospitals around the world. Most of them are being used for research: the devices are considered interesting options not only for stroke rehabilitation, but also for treating, for example, depression and tinnitus. “The applications for our equipment will definitely broaden over time,” says Huhtala. “Nexstim is interested in stroke patients because the company must maintain its strategic focus. It is nevertheless good that our customers test the equipment for other purposes – at the same time, it allows us to see what clinical opportunities exist.” Nexstim has subsidiaries in the US and Germany and a total of 34 employees, roughly one-third of which are located outside Finland. The US is the company’s first official market area, where NBS technology is currently the focus of a multi-centre study in which an external research organisation tests the technology on patients in several different centres. “Because of clinical testing in the US, we started commercialising there,” says Huhtala. “The US is a sensible starting point also because it is a big, independent market area with consistent compensation and operating models in healthcare.” The multi-centre study will play a big role in determining the company’s future plans. The final results will be obtained next year and will reveal how strong the clinical foundations of the technology are. Thereafter, full efforts to commercialise the technology can be launched. Huhtala lists patients, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies as the stakeholders who need to be convinced of the research results. Nexstim’s technology has been developed for 15 years, and until the company’s public listing last autumn, it was funded entirely by venture capital, meaning by continuous funding rounds. Nexstim represents a business where product development takes a long time, incurs tremendous costs and demands a lot of testing. It’s not for the impatient. The people at Nexstim, however, are not discouraged. “This is a wonderful opportunity to bring Finnish technology to the world,” says Huhtala. “The best is when stroke patients contact us: when the foreign media do a story on us, we often get enquiries from people asking if NBS would help them and when they can begin treatment.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/world-is-changing-finnish-startup-helps-teachers-to-keep-up/,"World is changing, Finnish startup helps teachers to keep up","In a fast changing world schools can struggle to keep up. This is where Scool comes in. With lessons from the praised Finnish education system, the Helsinki-based startup wants to create innovative learning formats that encourage curiosity and co-operation. “We believe that in this fast-changing world schools need to be involved in the change and that it will happen through [so-called] forerunner teachers,” says , head of operations at  . “We want to help them to operate in the best possible way in schools in Finland and around the world.” This is the ideology behind Scool: a mission to develop learning formats, such as media materials and digital resources for teachers, that help bridge the gap between schools and the outside world. Like a production company, Scool creates a concept, tests and develops it in cooperation with teachers in Finland and finally makes it available for primary and secondary schools around the world. The emphasis is on bringing real-world relevance and deep learning skills such as curiosity, critical thinking, creativity and co-operation into classrooms. “We don’t want to tell teachers how they could, for example, teach maths or history better. Instead we want to give them tools to introduce phenomenon-based [interdisciplinary] learning into their own subjects,” Leponiemi explains. Founded in early 2015 by TV producers   and  plus investor   and backed by one million dollars in funding, Scool is built around two existing formats: ‘Campus’ and ‘Dreamdo Schools’. “Our services spread largely on the grassroots level. One teacher tells another that ‘this is a great thing, try this’,” says Lasse Leponiemil. First organised in Helsinki in 2011, Campus is a seminar series that helps teachers understand how the world is changing. Through events, reports and online lectures teachers can learn about topical issues from robotics and global warming to music styles and mobile applications from experts in different fields. After five sold out seminars, including one in Warsaw last year, Campus is now expanding to Amsterdam, Atlanta, Stockholm and Vilnius. “The aim is to give teachers readiness to talk about these interesting phenomenons with their students,” explains Leponiemi. While Campus is targeted at teachers, Dreamdo Schools is all about engaging students. It enables school classes around the world to do interdisciplinary, student-led projects – such as a puppet theatre on intercultural communication done in Jordania – and share their progress online. The key is that students decide the project topic. Dreamdo Schools provides a digital platform and teachers’ materials to take the project from an idea and planning phase to finalisation. “Phenomenal learning is in the core of Dreamdo Schools,” says Leponiemi. “Kids don’t think it as learning when they, for example, organise an event and calculate a budget for it, even though it’s all about maths.” The programme, launched as a pilot last fall, has had flying start. Thanks mostly to word of mouth, it has already attracted schools from 24 countries and has over 60 projects underway. However Scool doesn’t have to rely entirely on the grapevine. In May, the startup will be presenting its services to public schools in New York. It’s a step forward to Scool’s goal of building a global network of teachers who are interested in developing teaching methods, deep learning skills and using digital tools. Scool calls them ‘forerunner teachers’. “We want to work as much as possible with teachers,” Leponiemi says. “Our target is that by 2017 there will be 100 000 teachers actively using several of our products.” Currently Scool is working on two new products for launch later this year. The aim is to build a portfolio of learning formats which are globally scalable to fit any curriculum and be locally adoptable by different teachers. “We are constantly thinking of new ways to make the world outside of schools a natural part of the classroom experience,” Leponiemi says and concludes: “We want to offer teachers a toolbox to help them in their everyday work.” “Finland has a great basic education system that is genuinely equal,” says Leponiemi. “It gives us at Scool the opportunity to test different learning formats with hard core experts and demanding teachers to develop the best possible products we can introduce to the world.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rewindr-blazes-a-trail-for-the-outdoors-community/,Rewindr blazes a trail for the outdoors community,"This mobile navigational guide encourages people to leave their mark when they head outdoors. Given the extremity of the Arctic weather conditions here, it can be surprising to learn that Finns are some of the most outdoorsy types in the world. Regardless if it is +20 or -20 Celsius, you can be sure to find people outside hiking, jogging or cycling. The change of seasons is not seen as a hindrance to exercise, but merely a means of inviting fresh opportunities for being out of doors. For  , the arrival of spring brings with it a necessary annual tradition: embarking on an 80-kilometre mountain bike journey along the Karhunkierros trail with his business partner  . The route stretches between the north-eastern Finnish towns of Salla and Kuusamo, and is also one of the most popular hiking trails in Finland. However, for the newcomer, there is much to know about what lies ahead before setting off. “To go for a 80-kilometre hike like that you need water, food and shelter,” Mäenpää outlines. Aside from the wilderness huts, campfire sites and lean-to shelters situated along the way, he also points out that hikers need to take into account there are “a couple of places where you can come off the Karhunkierros trail onto paved routes.” By utilising GPS tracking to chart the various trails being taken, Rewindr allows users to post information that might be useful to future hikers, climbers or mountain bikers. During their many outdoors adventures in Finland and abroad, Mäenpää and Lajunen have accumulated a vast amount of similar practical information regarding the trails they have embarked upon. Lamenting the fact that such information hasn’t been readily available for all routes worldwide, two years ago they decided to pool their knowledge with that of the global community. “  is a route guide for the digital age with a sports tracker,” Mäenpää explains. “We are giving out good, reliable, trustworthy information to people in the wilderness.” Initially focusing on trails in Finland, Sweden and Norway, the app features input from guidebook authors in order to give an accurate overview of various routes. Rewindr is loaded with trail information such as distance and average completion time, along with perceived difficulty. It also contains an official Finnish terrain map, which can be used offline. The Rewindr team is encouraging social interaction as a means to develop the service further. The sheer volume of different routes globally represents a prime opportunity to tap into user participation. By utilising GPS tracking to chart the various trails being taken, the app allows users to post information that might be useful to future hikers, climbers or mountain bikers. “In the coming releases each user can set up and share their own routes,” Mäenpää outlines. “They can compare performance, ranking them through likes and dislikes. Rewindr also enables people to share recordings of their performance and pictures.” The Rewindr team seeks to monetise the service by suggesting a number of sponsored routes to users. National parks, hotels and restaurants in the vicinity of each trail can pay to be featured favourably in the listings. However, Mäenpää is quick to point out that generating a profit isn’t the main focus of the venture. “We are not doing this just for the sake of business,” he confesses. “We are doing it because we need it, and we think somebody else will also. We are hoping to discover new routes around the world.” As enthusiasm for the idea builds worldwide, so too does the Finnish perspective to being outdoors. “What we hope to accomplish with Rewindr is that people will be outside more and it will make them healthier.” Rewindr utilises GPS tracking to chart various trails around the world.

The next logical step is…smartwatches. Gaming and tiny displays aren’t an obvious mix to many, but Finnish gaming industry veterans  ,   and   saw something when Apple announced its smartwatch last September: an opportunity to step away from the existing, saturated, gaming platforms. “We got excited by the idea of a completely new Apple platform and one that is so different that content needs to be made for it from scratch,” explains Järvilehto, CEO of  . “We sounded out our business plan with a few investors we know ten days before Christmas…On Christmas Eve we signed the papers for half a million in seed funding. It’s the fastest funding round I have ever seen.” It was also the start of the world’s first wearable games studio. Backed by Finnish VC Lifeline Ventures and Copenhagen-based Sunstone Capital, Everywear Games was able to bring in two new team members and launch its first smartwatch game   concurrently with the Apple Watch in April. “We have been joking that we are able to do something with a small team that would be impossible to do in this timeframe with a large team. The combination of a small team and outsourcing is the fastest way to get ahead,” Järvilehto says. “We are hiring vigorously but aim to keep our size relatively small.” Runeblade is a fantasy adventure game created for the Apple Watch by Helsinki-based Everywear Games. The game was featured by Apple at its smartwatch launch in April and has been positively received by international media. What Everywear has gained in speed, it hasn’t compromised in ambition. Instead of starting with a simple puzzle game, Runeblade is a full-blooded fantasy adventure game with spells, swords and monsters… yet tailored for smartwatch gaming. “We found a design approach where the gaming experience is dramatically simplified and its sweet spot or duration is 5-15 seconds. You go to the game to do a few spells and moves and then let the game take the story forward,” describes Järvilehto. “But while the gaming experience has been simplified to make it super approachable, the story is extremely high-flown.” In essence it is what Everywear calls ‘Twitter-sized entertainment’. Gameplay is stripped to its core and tailored for bite-size sessions, but builds into an in-depth gaming experience which can be enjoyed for months. Currently the Helsinki-based company is working on expanding the world of Runeblade while a more casual second game is in the cards in the fall. For the time being, Everywear is solely focused on the Apple Watch as it wants to perfect the gaming experience on one platform before expanding to other wearables. “Now there are a few other [smartwatch games] companies, but we were able to get a headstart on this platform,” Järvilehto says. “We aim to make our games the number one solution for this platform and define the consumer experience on it.” As the company estimates there will be 100-200 million Apple Watches sold globally in 2016-2017, it’s not a bad market to be a frontrunner. While the funding from Lifeline’s   and Sunstone’s Nyholm enabled Everywear to move quickly and grow, Järvilehto also emphasises the expertise the right investors bring: “We think they are the best gaming investors in Europe. It’s fantastic to have them in our board to help to build the company,” says Järvilehto, who argues funding rounds shouldn’t be about selling or buying, but collaboration. He points out investors would often like to know the people they invest in. What if you are a startup looking for funding but don’t know any investors? It would be healthy at times to put yourself in the shoes of the investor and think why you as an investor would be interested in your case. “In my experience: network, network and network. The best way to get to known investors is in situations where you aren’t pitching to them,” says Järvilehto. “There are so many events such as Startup Sauna and others where you can meet investors. I warmly recommend startups to go and talk with them and ask openly what kind of cases they are interested in.” However networks are no use if you don’t have an original and interesting idea, preferably one that is ambitious and has international appeal. Smartwatch games are a good example, but even they need a good business plan to back them up.  “Gaming is an industry that creates value faster than any other, but it’s also notoriously tough for investors to assess. What is entertainment value and what will create a hit?,”   from Sunstone Capital explains. “The tight knit Finnish industry makes it easier to assess the quality of the team – absolutely the only thing that matters when investing in the earliest phases.” Järvilehto also stresses the importance in understanding how investors work: “It would be healthy at times to put yourself in the shoes of the investor and think why you as an investor would be interested in your case,” Järvilehto explains. “It would be great if startups read even one book targeted at investors. It’ll give them perspective on how investors work and choose their cases.” And for those lucky ones who get to the agreement signing stage, Järvilehto gives one practical tip: don’t do it all yourself. Hire a lawyer who knows the local business environment and legislation. Judging by the flying start of Everywear Games, better keep these tips close. Aki Järvilehto credits the success of the Finnish gaming industry partly to its strong community: “An exceptional feature in Finland is how much everybody pull together, supports each other and doesn’t really compete with one another. This is almost entirely an export business and when somebody wins in it, Finland wins.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nordtouch-created-flinga-to-get-everyone-on-black-board/,Nordtouch created Flinga to get everyone on (black)board,"Nordtouch wants to get smart devices out of students’ pockets and make them useful with its mobile application Flinga. Initially the aim was to provide schools with technology, but now Flinga is seen as a tool for exporting Finnish expertise in education. Sometimes technology gives teachers a hard time. Pupils and students focus on social media and gaming instead of teaching. Does it make sense to actually encourage the young to get their phones out? ”If we think about the world the young live in, it’s hard to see schools as isolated islands. It’s important to learn to take advantage of technology to support learning and skills needed in the labour market,” says  , CEO of  . Nordtouch’s Flinga makes smart devices useful in the classroom. Flinga functions as a communal blackboard, onto which all pupils can log in using their personal smart devices. ”Flinga makes learning a shared activity. The teacher isn’t just preaching and pupils listening, but they can together add questions, photos, comments and whatnot onto Flinga,” Raja describes. The idea is BYOD; bring your own device. Because students log into the workspace created by the teacher from their personal smart device, the schools don’t need to invest in getting a device per student. By purchasing a few, not everyone needs to own a smartphone or a tablet. ”It’s like physical education classes: if you’ve not got a pair of skis, the school will lend you some.” Both Raja and the other founder of Nordtouch,  , studied at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. For his final thesis, Raja was innovating technical solutions in learning spaces at a time when tablets were becoming a part of teaching. Raja was wondering how to make devices used for teaching interact. That’s how the prototype of Flinga saw daylight. The Department of Teacher Education at the University of Helsinki got excited about the idea. Raja says that the university is an important partner for Nordtouch. “We call the university our pedagogical backbone,” he says laughingly. Collaborating with the university made Nordtouch want to improve pedagogical skills, too. Flinga doesn’t only offer tools for expanding the ways of teaching, but also creates new teaching methods. ”Methods that encourage participation and activeness are exactly what’s needed in teaching. At first we were purely a software firm, but now I hope we’ll grow into an educational expert.” ”If we think about the world the young live in, it’s hard to see schools as isolated islands. It’s important to learn to take advantage of technology to support learning and skills needed in the labour market,” says Ilari Raja, CEO of Nordtouch. Flinga has been designed to suit all levels of education. So far the small company has focused on marketing the application to universities and polytechnics. ”We just haven’t had enough legs to run through institutions of primary and secondary education,” says Raja. One way of reaching out to, for example, primary schools is to cooperate with publishers. Flinga is already a part of some digital learning materials and their learning environments. The biggest challenge is to get teachers excited about tools like Flinga. Raja points out that although teachers are creative and innovative, technical devices can sometimes be deemed suspicious. ”Even if the teacher used similar methods in the analogical world, technology can be seen as something compulsory or evil. Applying it needs an adjustment period.” Raja doesn’t think the enthusiasm of the students and pupils is an issue, because for them technology is so familiar to begin with. On a digital whiteboard the teacher can make sure everyone is involved. Raja believes that Flinga activates the shy ones sitting in the back. ”Flinga revolves around the thoughts and ideas of the students. If someone doesn’t have the courage to open his or her mouth, maybe they are brave enough to “fling” their idea and then notice how their ideas are worth sharing, too.” Currently the two founders work at Nordtouch full-time. Sales and marketing expertise comes from an investor. The aim is to head to the world, particularly to Europe and Asia. Nordtouch has presence in Singapore and London. With Flinga, Raja wants to export Finnish knowhow in education. Even if the team will never have its own education specialist, cooperation will be kept tight. “Flinga will soon get a pedagogical module, from which teachers can get support to develop activating teaching methods and making use of the application.” Finland’s reputation as a textbook example of education is beneficial to Nordtouch. Raja thinks Finland could use the reputation to its advantage a whole lot more than it’s doing now. ”Finland’s got what it takes to be in the forefront of education technology, because we’ve got plenty of knowledge in both education and technology like mobile applications. Well commercialised product packages would help us make education an exportable product.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/molok-wastes-no-time-during-african-expansion/,Molok wastes no time during African expansion,"These Finnish waste solutions continue breaking new ground with their clean, safe and efficient alternatives. While the southwest Finnish town of Nokia is renowned for spawning a certain eponymous mobile communications company, one shouldn’t assume that this is the municipality’s sole claim to fame in the business world. Far from it. Since 1991, local company   has been providing its semi-underground Deep Collection waste containers to a global customer base. While their biggest markets are in Northern and Western Europe, the company has seen rapid expansion in Africa during the past few years. After some minor sales were made in Angola, Molok first arrived in Namibia almost four years ago to undertake a comprehensive pilot study testing the market’s potential. With Southern Africa’s regional economy experiencing annual growth of around five per cent, prospects seemed promising. The company certainly didn’t anticipate what was to come. Setting up their inaugural container at a hospital in Ondangwa, good word-of-mouth saw Molok spreading quickly around Namibia and into the neighbouring countries of Zambia and South Africa. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, indeed. After some minor sales were made in Angola, Molok first arrived in Namibia almost four years ago to undertake a comprehensive pilot study testing the market’s potential. Now with a presence in eight African countries, the hygienic properties of Molok containers are successfully challenging stereotypes surrounding rubbish in the region. “Normally when speaking about waste people are used to bins being left open that are full and have garbage bags lying around,” explains  , controller, global activities at Molok. However, the simple yet effective design of the Molok storage containers offers a welcome alternative. Around 60 per cent of each container is located below ground, taking up less space and serving another important purpose. “Because of the coolness of the ground, there are no problems with odour,” Duhamel explains, also pointing to the effectiveness of having a black lid firmly capping the container. “When the sun hits the lid, the waste also dries and then there is no smell.” Another telltale sign of a poorly kept rubbish disposal area – flies and mosquitoes – are typically non-existent around Molok containers, due to the unique design helping diminish humidity levels. For Molok, entering a new market is not about simply digging a hole, filling it with a container and asking people to put their rubbish in it. Extensive market research is needed beforehand, including finding a distributer already active in the local waste management business. For their African pursuit, they chose Rent-A-Drum, a firm well-established in many Southern African countries. Together they implement pilot projects to gauge future successes and win municipal approval. “Distributors do all of the checking of the sites, and also organise the group that will dig the hole in the ground and install the container,” Duhamel explains. “It’s pretty simple; not much technology. Once it is installed it is ready to use.” To keep up with demand Molok has also licensed their containers to a distributer in Namibia. Cutting down on the sizeable transportations times and costs, this local production is concentrating solely on Southern Africa sales at the moment. This may change in the near future. The company is also closely looking at markets in Mozambique, Ethiopia and Kenya, and has been entertaining interest from some Central African nations. Competition in the waste removal industry is fierce, yet Molok remains unfazed – the quality of their products is evident. “Of course, we have many competitors, but they come and go,” Duhamel observes. “We still have the same bags and lids in use in some [global] locations. Our products are really durable and long lasting.” Around 60 per cent of each Molok container is located below ground to avoid unwanted odours."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vivid-works-knows-where-your-new-couch-should-go/,VividWorks knows where your new couch goes,"It is a struggle to buy furniture because you don’t know how it will look once you get it home. Now a Finnish company lets you visualise different furnishings in your home before you even leave the store. If you’ve ever bought a new couch and couldn’t decide if it would look better under the window or next to the wall, a Finnish company is coming to the rescue. Saving aching backs everywhere,   has developed a system where you can see how your new couch will look in various places in your living room – all before you even leave the furniture store. “Our main customers are in the furniture industry,” says  , VividWorks’ chief operating officer. “These are both manufacturers and retailers. In Finland we have all the major chains and in Sweden we have companies like EM.” Their product, VividPlatform, allows 3D visualisation of furniture in an interior environment. The user can experiment with different pieces of furniture in different locations around a home. The company has four different editions of their service for manufacturers, retailers, contract businesses and interior designers. “We have two major differentiations,” Palo continues. “One is for the configuration possibilities for visualisation, and the other is for ecommerce. It can be integrated with the back office. You can design and build as well as place orders.” VividPlatform allows 3D visualisation of furniture in an interior environment. Some of the founders of Vivid Works began connecting 3D visualisation with sales functionality in Silicon Valley in 1998. From the beginning they realised that visualisation was one thing, but making it a sales tool was an important innovation. This made it popular in the furniture industry and the company continues to grow globally. “The US market is growing nicely,” says Palo. “We have some major customer agreements with large companies we are currently working on.” He says that from the very beginning the company planned to operate internationally and now they are in a position to seize new markets. Besides the Nordic region and America, the company is also expanding in Japan. “We had our first Japanese customer about two years ago, and we have been actively developing the market for about one and a half years. Japan is our next big step. This summer at an industry fair we will be announcing some major news.” Palo says that Finland is a fine home base for VividWorks and is ideal for running an international business. He cites the talented workforce and advanced Finnish technology as major advantages. “We have operations in Oulu and Helsinki,” he says. “Our research and development is in Finland because there are such good resources and an inspiring environment. The technology know-how is very high so we can get good people to work with us. The online environment is advanced and the number of people on mobile connections is also very high.” With a stable foundation in Finland the company is now anticipating aggressive growth in targeted new markets. “With the cloud we are fully scalable and we have the architecture in place for our global expansion,” he concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wolt-cuts-down-time-at-the-counter/,Wolt cuts down time at the counter,"Not enough time to wait around for your coffee or lunch to be prepared at your favourite establishment? The solution is in your pocket. If success in life is reflected by the company that you keep, then the future is looking pretty rosy for  . Located in the same office building as the globe-conquering Finnish duo of Supercell and Jolla, this fresh startup also has another ace up its sleeve: it’s run by former Slush CEO,  . The idea for the app is simple: using your phone to order and pay in advance for a coffee, drink or meal from your favourite establishment. At the other end, your order is received via tablet and you are informed when it will be ready – down to the minute. All that remains is picking up your item. Simple as that. But it’s not just about takeaway. Sidestep long queues and order from your table, for example, and have your drink brought to you instead. During his four-year tenure at Slush, Kuusi kept a close eye on the fluctuating trends surrounding him at the rapidly evolving startup event. From this unique vantage point he identified a seismic shift in the way people now do business. “There are disruptions happening in different industries,” he states. “The biggest retailer in the world is the Alibaba group, and they own no stock themselves. The biggest hospitality service in the world is Airbnb, and they own no apartments. The biggest taxi company in the world is Uber and they own no cars.” The Wolt crew. (left to right) Mika Matikainen, Lauri Andler, Oskari Pétas, Juhani Mykkänen (in front), Miki Kuusi and Elias Pietilä. Similarly, when near field communication (NFC) payments arrived recently with much fanfare, it seemed that credit cards were facing redundancy. Kuusi, however, was less convinced. “I figured I am going to do everything exactly the same as before, but instead of taking out my credit card [to pay], I take out my phone and tap it. That’s not a big change.” But, as for the idea of shaking up the approach to payments – now, that was of some interest indeed. Kuusi quickly joined the dots of opportunity. Retail is predominantly online. The future of buying food from brick-and-mortar stores is hurtling towards e-commerce. Everybody eats two-or-three times a day. Cue: pensive stroking of chin. It was time to take a truly digital approach to restaurants, bars and cafes. Gathering a team together, a prototype was made that would illustrate their ambitions to interested parties. Using it also to draw valuable feedback from merchants and users, Wolt soon attracted 400 000 euros in angel funding. Since then it’s been full steam ahead. Landing in the App Store in March, user feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. However, Kuusi is quick to point out that it’s not only the customer who benefits. “It’s really simple to use and inexpensive for the restaurant. Every order that comes through Wolt is already paid for, so it saves a lot of time. If you receive bigger orders you don’t have to take the risk that someone is not going to show up or not be able to pay.” With things off to a good start, Kuusi acknowledges that Wolt is still at a very early stage, only operating in Helsinki. The signs are already promising for a wider shift in dining behaviour in the near future, with negotiations continuing with significant European restaurant chains and 20 establishments ready for Wolt in Berlin. Other signs are more immediate: “It’s nice to see our users give feedback that they ‘Wolted’ a lunch,” Kuusi says with a smile."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/keypro-found-market-niche-in-emerging-countries/,Keypro found market niche in emerging countries,"Keypro, which offers solutions and expertise in the field of geographical information, has developed a unique application that has already managed to convince nearly 200 customers in Finland. The Finnish company now intends to play an even stronger role in building infrastructure networks in emerging countries. Geographical information means all of the data that includes references to a specific place or geographical area. Geographical information systems (GIS) can be applied to surveying, network technology (power lines, sewer lines etc.), traffic control, population registers, environmental monitoring and land-use management in, for example, city planning. ’s CEO   is having his photo taken in Helsinki’s Esplanadi park. His surroundings are buzzing with people and cars. Paila could, using the products and applications produced by his company, tell us a lot about the environs of the photo shoot: what kind of cables and water and sewage pipes run underground and what larger network the nearby streetlights are connected to. Keypro’s customers are companies with different kinds of networks, such as telecom operators, water utilities and power companies, among others. Keypro offers location and characteristics data for the infrastructure owned by the customer, such as sewers, cables and power lines. In addition Keypro offers practical expert services such as surveying, network documentation and planning. “We need to know the location and characteristics of networks and why the component of a network, such as a cable, is located in a specific place. A water pipe, for example, has a specific location, it is made out of a certain material and we usually know when it was installed and repaired. For optical fibre cables we need to know who the network connection is supplied to, in addition to the cable’s location and material,” says Paila. Keypro was established in 1995 around a service business focusing on geographical information. Services were produced using the tools available at the time and little by little the company began noticing that many things could be done a lot more simply. Traditional geographical information software is tied to a single workstation and requires the user to pay for a licence. “We at Keypro began to wonder why we need expensive software licences and why the software can only be used on a single computer, which makes it difficult to take it out in the field. That’s where the object of the information lies, after all,” says Paila. According to Toni Paila local experts are often needed as partners when working in foreign countries. The company finally developed software that is unique in its field – even globally. The software runs in a web browser, meaning that it can be used in the field on, for example, a tablet or smart phone. Additionally there is no need for each user at the client company to have a licence, just a user ID and password. Another unique feature is that the software can be applied to different sectors. According to Paila, Keypro has two groups of competitors. The first group includes companies that offer traditional workstation-dependent GIS solutions. The second group of competitors is a lack of GIS solutions, i.e. that no software is used or, at the most, old paper maps. This last group is where Keypro’s niche in the international markets lies. Proper infrastructure is only now being built in many emerging countries. They still use manual methods, to a great deal, such as solutions based on paper maps. “Operators in emerging markets can skip traditional workstation-reliant licence-based solutions altogether; they can move straight onto the modern GIS solutions that we offer. Our solutions are also a feasible option for them in terms of price: traditional GIS programs are priced so high that companies in emerging markets rarely have the resources to acquire them,” Paila says. Shifting over to modern GIS solutions from paper maps is thus simpler and more affordable than before: Keypro’s solution does not require investments in separate equipment – basically, a simple internet connection is enough. Users also always have the latest solution as software updates are part of the service. In addition to Finland, the company operates in the Philippines, Poland, Ukraine, Croatia, Turkey, Oman and Qatar. Market surveys have also been conducted in Albania and Vietnam, and pilots have been carried out in Estonia. Kazakhstan is also under consideration. “In foreign countries we nearly always work together with a partner specialising in geographical and network information. With their help we are able to gain a foothold in local systems – it is after all a very local sector,” Paila says. The software developed by Keypro runs in a web browser, meaning that it can be used at worksites on, for example, a tablet or smart phone."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pelago-bicycles-biking-its-way-to-the-world/,Pelago Bicycles biking its way to the world,"What do a trip around the world, cyclocross and a work commute have in common? Answer: They can all be done on a Finnish-made Pelago bicycle. The goal of the Finnish company, founded in 2009, is to design beautiful bicycles that appeal to bikers in Helsinki and Barcelona alike.   is currently riding a tailwind: some 40 per cent of the company’s present sales are in export markets. It all started from a shared interest – or interests.   and his brother,  , were both studying graphic design and were both active bikers. Their passion for biking led them to scour waste skips and recycling centres to rescue “bike carcasses”, as they put it. Their goal was to build bicycles according to their own personal style and as cheaply as possible, since they couldn’t find what they needed in the market. “The only bikes available were those sold in supermarkets and expensive performance bikes,” says Hyppönen, the founder of the company. They set out to build the kind of bicycles that they wanted to ride. The bikes needed to embody beautiful form, and they had to be durable and suitable for a wide range of purposes. In inner city areas, for example, cobblestone streets are a challenge for the bicycle commuter. “We wanted to do a basic bicycle really well,” Hyppönen sums up. Efforts to build new bikes from old parts were, however, short-lived: it was too costly and labour-intensive. It was back to the drawing board for the brothers. After a brief search, they found a suitable partner in Belgium with whom they shared a common vision. Finding a bicycle store and engaging in bike selling came about almost by accident. “We needed a place to show our first bikes, and a commercial space just happened to be available next to the office. Our intention was only to open up a showroom, but it eventually became our shop. We didn’t have any sales staff or even customers. We sold directly to consumers. It was neither our goal nor our intention to open up a store – it just happened,” recounts Hyppönen. According to Timo Hyppönen, the founder of Pelago, it’s not just about making money, it’s also about the desire to represent cycling and about making good bikes that will enhance the cycling experience for customers. Pelago bikes have grown from the first prototypes assembled in the office to an international bicycle brand with operations managed out of Jätkäsaari in Helsinki. The most popular Pelago bikes can be spotted in everyday city use: according to Hyppönen, the classic Brooklyn and Bristol bikes are the biggest sellers. In addition to classic, everyday bikes, Pelago offers a range of lightweight, active bikes suitable for longer rides, as well as advanced technical bikes in a higher price range for competitive cycling. For this Finnish bicycle manufacturer, being able to use the bicycle in wintertime is also very important: the Sibbo road bicycle, for example, has led to victory in a local cyclocross competition. Pelago bicycles are nowadays largely manufactured in Taiwan, which has an established reputation as a bicycle manufacturing nation, but they are designed and tested in Finland. Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the UK are currently the countries with the most Pelago fans.  Pelago has close to 100 distributors in Europe, Finland included. What, then, is the big draw of Pelago abroad? According to Hyppönen, different cases can be made for each competitor: “Compared to some, we are more youthful and have more street credibility; compared to others, we might be less sporty.” The “Finnishness” of the bikes is also worth mentioning. There’s a certain exotic element to owning a Finnish bicycle. Hyppönen believes the best way to achieve visibility among the average consumer, both in Finland and abroad, is simple: “The bike can be seen on the streets and people are interested in it.” Pelago’s logo bears the company’s Latin motto: solid, useful, beautiful. When Hyppönen speaks, his genuine passion for cycling shines through. In his opinion, it is important that the bike distributors sense the genuineness and passion in what the company does. Pelago Bicycles have, among other things, supported two young men in their trip around the world by offering them bicycles. “Whereas cars have been the traditional status symbol, maybe bicycles can be too. It says something about people’s values,”  Hyppönen sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-innovation-takes-a-green-spin-on-fibre-yarn-production/,Finnish innovation takes a green spin on fibre yarn production,"The textile industry is dominated by synthetic fibres and cotton, neither which can boast their green credentials. Finnish startup Spinnova aims to change this with a new chemical-free fibre yarn production technology. Cost-effective and sustainable production, natural material… the list goes on when  CEO and co-founder of  , talks about the fibre yarn technology developed by his company. With our technology we can make yarn directly, for example, from wood fibres from a pulp mill. “With our technology we can make yarn directly, for example, from wood fibres from a pulp mill,” Poranen explains. “Let’s say you take Scandinavian long fibre soft wood pulp as the raw material, in our technology the pulp is driven through a small nozzle. This makes the fibres line up parallel and bond with one another – and yarn is formed.“ In other words, Spinnova’s patented technology turns wood fibres directly into yarn and the chemical processing needed in traditional textile fibre production methods can be left out. This not only improves cost efficiency but makes the process kinder to the environment. Furthermore the use of water and raw materials and their recyclability are enhanced. “The opportunities and potential are huge. The technology can be used both in specialised products produced in small volumes and has great potential in clothing textiles,” Poranen enthuses. “If our goals regarding the textile industry are realised, we have a good chance to scale this technology globally.” Spinnova’s fibre yarn technology is only entering the product development phase, but has received a welcoming response both from potential clients and investors. The company, established in January, has already raised 1.95 million euros in funding and in February it won the international biorefinery competition organised by the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Spinnova’s fibre yarn technology makes it possible to spin yarn directly from wood fibres. The chemical-free technology is cost-efficient and kind to the environment. The panel of judges described Spinnova’s innovation as a breakthrough technology that can revolutionise both the textile and forest industries, and create significant new business in the future. The innovation originates from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, where the technology was first developed. Poranen used to work in the pulp and paper sector research at VTT, but a year ago he decided he wanted to speed up the development of the fibre yarn technology. After convincing the ‘father’ of the technology,  , to start a company with him, Spinnova was born. “VTT has a strategic goal to generate new companies and business out of the technologies developed there,” Poranen explains. “In practice, VTT has a subsidiary ‘VTT Ventures’ which manages process related to spin-off companies.” In addition to VTT Ventures, Spinnova’s shareholders include Austrian textile fibre manufacturer Lenzig AG, investment company Besodos and a group of private investors, including former Nokia CTO  . Currently Spinnova has a five member team working to take the fibre yarn technology from laboratory to larger scale industrial production. “If everything goes well, in a couple of years we will have launched our first demo products which use the yarns produced with this technology,” says Poranen. “Around 2020 our aim is to start larger scale demo factory investments and industrial production.” Considering the size of global textile industry (estimated to   in 2015), it’s not surprising Spinnova has clear international ambitions from the start. Large textile corporations are an obvious target group, but Poranen believes the technology has plenty of applications also for small, specialised companies. He notes in particular the potential of creating a textile material which is entirely recyclable. However, both the applications and Spinnova’s role on the market will be shaped with time: “We will be both a technology provider and a producer of our own yarns,” Poranen concludes. “It is too early to say what our final business model will look like.” Spinnova uses wood pulp in its fibre yarn production. It is a sustainable raw material as Finnish forests don’t need artificial watering or take land from food crops."

One such disease is glaucoma, caused by high eye pressure. The disease can slowly sneak up on a person, which makes early diagnosis important in terms of treatment. Icare Finland has taken on this challenge and revolutionised with its technology the measurement of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) – on a global scale. “We manufacture mobile tonometers for optometrists, opticians, general practitioners and emergency room doctors,” says  ’s CEO  . “We also have tonometers for use at home and ones with a slightly different structure for vets. Our tonometers have thus become the routine measuring device for all of our user groups.” Measuring intra-ocular pressure has previously only been possible using methods requiring local anaesthesia and even general anaesthesia for children. One option has been blowing a puff of air into the eye – which is rather uncomfortable for the patient. The devices used by doctors have additionally required lengthy training. The mobile tonometer developed by Icare Finland is precise and easy to use, and does not cause discomfort to the patient, making anaesthesia unnecessary. Due to the ease, speed and painlessness of Icare Finland’s tonometer, it has achieved a great deal of popularity abroad. Of the company’s sales, 40 per cent stems from the United States, where the company has a subsidiary. Second on the list is Japan, followed by Australia and several European countries. Icare Finland produces tonometers with different kind of design for the intra-ocular pressure measurement of adults, children and animals. “Our tonometer is also the only one that works in field conditions, which means it can be taken anywhere. It is used a lot in developing countries. We provide assistance to development organisations which screen people in rural areas using our device, one village at a time, so that those requiring treatment can be diagnosed,” says Hildén. Selling health care technology around the world like Icare Finland does is not as easy as it may seem: there are a number of challenges involved in exporting medical devices. Firstly, each country has a different set of permits and criteria that the devices must meet. “Secondly, this market is extremely conservative. The training doctors receive in different countries varies slightly, and they learn to use a specific device and become used to it. Switching to new equipment is thus always a slow process and requires opinion leaders who become the first to use the equipment,” says Hildén. Icare Finland is backed by a number of opinion leaders. Many top glaucoma researchers are interested in the company’s tonometers and have used them in their own clinical trials. They have published scientific studies on the subject, dozens to date, none of which Icare has funded. Through their independent publications, these researchers have become spokespersons for the company’s tonometers. Timo Hildén applauds the Finnish sector for its ease of networking. Hildén has been working in health care technology for the entire span of his career, in both Finnish and foreign companies. He applauds the Finnish sector for its ease of networking. “It is very easy in Finland to make contacts with universities and researchers operating in the same field. This gives us access to research results from the relevant sectors. In addition, Finland has very good health care, which definitely has an impact on the development of the health technology sector,” Hildén points out. He considers finding a growth track and export skills as the challenges faced by the Finnish health care sector. Continuous product development must not be overlooked either. Icare Finland is working towards an even broader patent portfolio through new screening devices. “We are currently developing asthma and skin cancer screening devices. We have also brought to the markets a device measuring bone density, for which we have distribution agreements in six European countries. Our goal is to gain a stronger foothold in this sector through new technologies,” says Hildén."

Finnish street names are typically a tongue twisting challenge for foreign visitors. With an often-baffling collage of consonants, their pronunciation is not for the faint of heart. Yet in the town of Sodankylä, some 950 km north of Helsinki, there is at least one exception: Samuel Fuller’s Street. But, hang on, why would a thoroughfare be named after the esteemed American director up here, of all places? The answer is a simple: he was the first international guest at the  , held in Sodankylä some 30 years ago. Unlike prestige events in Cannes, Venice and Toronto, there is little in the way of red carpet to be found at Finland’s longest running film festival. In fact, arriving here is akin to stumbling across a low-key village fair, with the former school grounds of the town populated by two circus tents-cum movie houses and a pop-up pub. And around 30 000 bleary-eyed guests. Quadrupling Sodankylä’s population for five days, this year’s edition saw audiences feasting on a cinematic smorgasbord around the clock on four different screens. Master classes conducted by international film critics were as enthusiastically welcomed as a karaoke screening of  ’s  , director  ’s slices of British life and Finnish classics both old and new. Such a diverse offering is key to the festival’s ongoing success, coupled with a distinct lack of pretence. Without a single sequin of glitz and glamour it has attracted some of the world’s greatest filmmakers over the years, including  ,  ,  ,   and  . Quadrupling Sodankylä’s population for five days, this year’s edition saw audiences feasting on a cinematic smorgasbord around the clock on four different screens When such guests aren’t introducing their films or fielding audience questions, they join queues at local fast food joints, watch silent films together accompanied by a live orchestra and generally wander about in wonderment, mingling with the similarly minded crowd. “We decided to have a festival in the middle of nowhere so everybody has to meet everybody, nobody can escape,” Finnish director    explained in a 2012 interview with  . “We tell the directors, ‘If you want to escape you’re welcome to. The airport is 150 km that way.’ Nobody has left so far.” However, there was one significant attendee who did not return in 2015: the late  . The beloved former festival director was one of its founding fathers, along with Aki Kaurismäki, his director brother   and fellow director  . On its 30th anniversary, the question on many lips beforehand was whether the festival could survive without such a revered figure. The answer was a resounding ‘yes’. Dedicated in his honour, his presence was felt acutely during the festival’s anniversary year, with a celebratory poster bearing his face seemingly on every wall around town and onscreen before each film. Consolation was also found among the many familiar faces of all ages in attendance, all here for the same reason he had been: a love of film. In spite of its offbeat nature, signs of the festival’s growth are increasingly evident. Screenings sold out faster, even though the main tent had been upgraded to one double in size. Other creature comforts are also creeping in to the humble surrounds: street food vans and even a public hot tub and sauna now offer respite from the gruelling 24-hour schedule of cinematic indulgence. Nonetheless, one constant that will never dim is the perpetual daylight greeting audiences emerging from each screening. No matter what time it is – it is always day. Disorientating maybe, but it sure fuels enthusiasm to catch just one more screening before turning in. Bidding the festival farewell for another year, this same light illuminates another linguistically pleasing sign for Anglophiles on a street corner behind Lapinsuu cinema: Peter von Bagh Street. As the festival lifts the curtain on its next 30 years, his spirit is set to live on in this otherwise nondescript town. As he put it more succinctly:  . The beloved former festival director Peter von Bagh was one of the founding fathers of the festival. This year’s festival commemorated him by screening many of his films and many of his all time favourites."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/going-to-california/,Going to California,"A group of Finns have gone to California to help solve a very American problem: finding the right doctor. The best business ideas find a solution to a pressing problem. Mobile phones allowed people to talk anywhere. Cars allowed people to travel without having to care for a horse. In America many people can’t find a good doctor. They might want a nearby specialist, who has a good reputation, and who accepts their private insurance plan. Ticking all the boxes can be a hassle. The Finn   discovered this when he moved to California. After spending days searching the web and calling offices, he came to the realisation that Americans needed a better way to find a doctor. He decided to partner with his ex-Nokia colleague   and do it themselves. “We have been building BetterDoctor’s consumer apps for four years, and are excited to have already helped 20 million people to find a better doctor,” says Ari Tulla, co-founder and CEO.  launched in late spring 2012, helping the people around the San Francisco bay find good, available doctors in a handful of specialities. By the autumn of 2012 they expanded nationwide. “We have been building BetterDoctor’s consumer apps for four years, and are excited to have already helped 20 million people to find a better doctor,” says Tulla, co-founder and CEO. The company has a database of over 1 million doctors, searchable by their location, specialty and insurance plans they accept. Consumers can even check to see which languages doctors speak or where they spent their residency. Additionally, BetterDoctor has a physician rating system, which checks medical licenses and education, experience and training, and how doctors are regarded and referred by their peers. They are also expanding their services in complementary areas, such as a doctor marketing business and licensing their data to third parties. “It’s really exciting to offer services beyond the consumer apps that people know us for,” Tulla says. Consumers can download the BetterDoctor app or use the service at no cost, so the company makes their money through related services. “The two monetisation areas are BetterDoctor marketing tools and data licensing,” Tulla continues. “Doctor marketing tools help doctors establish their online presence and get patient feedback. We offer a full suite of products from doctor websites to data syndication and patient feedback tools. Our data licensing business is based on our unique doctor database. Already over 100 companies have signed up and the first companies have launched new tools on top of our data.” Tulla believes that their openness and transparency are one of their main strengths, saying that he and his co-founder Tolvanen have long been open-source advocates and believe transparency via better data. BetterDoctor has a development hub in Helsinki, and the Finnish investor Lifeline is one of the lead investors in the company. They have also transplanted seven Finnish employees to work in San Francisco. “The biggest benefit of being a Finn in California is the curiosity factor, as people don’t know much about Finland,” Tulla says. “Also, it’s kind of cool to always be the only Finn at any event.” California might sometimes be portrayed as a Promised Land, but Tulla does miss Finland sometimes. “I miss the long, warm summer nights,” he says. “In San Francisco it is very rarely warm after dusk.” BetterDoctor has a database of over one million doctors, searchable by their location, specialty and insurance plans they accept."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/oikian-solutions-makes-the-market-personal/,Oikian Solutions makes the market personal,"Pioneering mobile targeting technologies and solutions flow forth from the northern city of Oulu. If you happen to be visiting Helsinki for the first time, alongside the ease with which public transport ferries you between interesting landmarks and the prevalent greenery, there is something you should know: it can really rain here. Really. So, say you turn the corner into Aleksanterinkatu, the main shopping street, and the heavens open. What to do? Before you can rush to seek shelter your phone beeps: a message from your hotel is informing you that there is an umbrella sale at a store just 20 metres down the road. Perfect timing. Thankfully, when checking in at your hotel you took up the front desk’s suggestion to download their ‘concierge’ app; one that utilises your phone to give you location-based information as you move about town. This is just one of  ’ many namesakes. “We are the sole company for mobile targeting technologies and solutions,” explains Mikko Lietsalmi. “We are the sole company for mobile targeting technologies and solutions,” explains  , CEO of the Oulu-based company. “We have platforms which we white label for our customers. With these they can target their content, be it advertising, news or emergency messages. [The clientele] is targeted based on their preferences, interests, location and time.” The three founders of Oikian Solutions are former Nokia colleagues. Five years ago, they realised that the marketing potential of mobile technology was not properly realised. In their mind, three distinct features of phones were merely gathering dust. “One was utilising knowledge about location,” Lietsalmi reflects. “Why shouldn’t advertising be so clever that it knows what is just around the corner and notifies you? Another thing was time. The third element was personalisation.” Bringing these three together was a simple task for the experienced trio, yet a more difficult ask was convincing businesses of what they had on their hands. Back then, enthusiasm for mobile marketing was at a standstill. The common opinion was that its potential had been squeezed dry – sending the occasional text message to their customers would suffice. However, what the Oikian Solutions trio had in mind could open the floodgates for innovative approaches to the marketplace. The trickle has quickly swollen in a gush: the likes of Sanoma and Kaleva in Finland are among their high profile customers, along with Daniel Footwear and TeliaSonera. The sole thing impeding Oikian Solutions is the imagination. Platforms pertaining to retail chains, publishing, hotel chains and restaurant chains are available, building proximity with their respective customer bases. The flow of information to the end user is facilitated with ease, with an easy to use self-serve tool into which companies feed information. Also, each platform can be integrated into other systems, such as a local tourist attraction database in the case of the ‘concierge’ app. Another important function of mobile targeting is closing the gap of downtime experienced by businesses. Amusement parks can inform when certain rides are not busy, for example. Even the humble barbershop can benefit from the technology. “Because you are registered on the service, the application knows you had your last haircut three-or-four weeks ago,” Lietsalmi enthuses. “Since you need a haircut, why shouldn’t we offer you the chance to cut your hair right now? The service knows there is no booking in five minutes and you are 100 metres away from the barbershop. Why shouldn’t they provide you with a dynamic price? Everybody’s happy.” He pauses for a moment, the future full of possibilities. “These kinds of interesting things you can do through mobile targeting.” Amusement parks can inform the customers when certain rides are not busy."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/solarch-brings-digitalisation-to-self-and-homecare-2/,Solarch brings digitalisation to self and homecare,"Do you worry about family members living in different places? Finnish health tech startup Solarch may have the answer. We have all had a doctor ask “are there any health problems in your family?” and not known or remembered the answer. It can be the same when trying to name your last vaccination or explain a relative’s health history to their caregiver. It is these kinds of experiences from which new online health service   stems. The service brings health records into the digital age, storing them online and sorting them into easily understandable information. It is a far cry from the outdated approach of stacks of paper stored somewhere in a drawer. Consequently information such as medication, vaccinations and recent treatments are always in your pocket – at least if you have access to the Internet. You can also set reminders for upcoming appointments and use graphs to follow wellbeing trends as well as create shared health profiles for your whole family. “We want to empower people to take a more active approach in their own health and the health of their loved ones”, says  , CEO and founder of  , the Helsinki-based startup behind the service. “Self-care and mobility are the future.” But the health database, called ‘With Me’, is only one part of the ActiveMEDI service. This is also joined by ‘ICE’ (In Case of Emergency) gadgets and its homecare provider service ‘Care’. Hasanpour strongly believes in the demand for a family-centric approach in online health and gave up a successful career at Nokia to start Solarch in 2012. His ambition is to provide bespoke digital services, both for individuals and their families, on the back of meaningful use of health data. The new ActiveMEDI online health service consists of three components: a health database for families, ICE gadgets for emergency situations and an online service for homecare providers. This is best illustrated by the company’s ICE emergency gadgets, launched last fall in partnership with the Alzheimer Society of Fnland. These products include emergency cards and stickers equipped with QR codes as well as bracelets, keychains and stickers which incorporate NFC (Near Field Communication). Developed in cooperation with emergency and health care professionals, the gadgets provide vital health information when a patient is unable to provide it themselves. All medical professionals need is a smartphone to get a fast access to the patient’s emergency profile and ICE contact details. “Imagine if my loved one with a heart disease goes out and falls. The ambulance personnel isn’t looking through  80 years of health data, but for crucial information which is potentially life saving, like heart ECG,” explains Hasanpour. ”We want to make that information easily available to the emergency personnel.” “I would also want to be the first to know if my loved one is in an emergency situation and not learn about it days later. Now [with ActiveMEDI] I receive an SMS alert if something has happened together with the location of the incident,” he continues. Similarly Solarch’s Care service is aimed at bringing peace of mind to both patients and their next of kin, as well as aiding homecare professionals. A notable example is homecare workers who can use the online service to manage their daily schedules, report progress with a few clicks and access up-to-date care information such as a change to a customer’s medication. Conversely the service allows a user’s family to communicate with the caregiver and receive real-time information on the visits. Solarch has had a busy start to the year. The company says that since its launch in late 2014 ActiveMEDI has attracted several thousands of registered online users and sold a few hundreds of emergency gadgets around Finland. It has also secured the first customer for its Care service, homecare services company Stella. Currently Solarch is working on new features such as integrating data from the Finnish National Archive of Health Information to ActiveMEDI. However, the next step for Solarch is to speed up internationalisation and it already is preparing for a few pilot projects for other Nordic countries. The service has already been translated into Swedish and English. Furthermore a new door opened for potential partnerships in May when the Nordic Independent Living Challenge (a health tech innovations competition for the elderly and disabled people) chose ActiveMEDI to its second stage. Winners will be announced later in the summer. To aid its expansion, the company is planning a new funding round to supplement its existing backing from Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation) and is actively looking to grow its team of four employees. “We have investors and partners in Norway and Finland. We are based in Finland, but see the Nordic region as our home market. Next we will turn to the UK, Middle East, and the rest of the world. That is the direction we are heading,” says ambitious Hasanpour.  “We want to build an online service the health sector doesn’t want to live without… an ecosystem where people and families are at the heart.” ”The service brings particular value to travellers, expats, people who have a loved one with chronic illness. In fact to anyone looking to take an active role in their health and wellbeing,” explains Solarch CEO Alireza Hasanpour."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/formal-friday-brings-fitting-rooms-online/,Formal Friday brings fitting rooms online,"A piece of clothing from an online shop doesn’t always quite fit its new owner, but the returns and refunds annoy both shoppers and entrepreneurs. Formal Friday Clothing made its website a fitting room and its clothes so high-quality and durable, that their customers stand a good chance of getting it right the first time around. The story behind   is two-fold. On the one end, there is fashion designer  ’s urge to design his own, high-quality and classic men’s collection; on the other, there are  ’s clothes that got ruined in the first wash. Internationally known as a top designer, Muurimäki has lived in Paris, Milan and Sydney designing clothes for many big names in the fashion industry from Dolce&Gabbana to Giorgio Armani. A while after he’d returned to his roots in Finland, he got a phone call from Tervilä. Tervilä was upset: the fashion clothes he’d bought whilst travelling in Spain had all gone nasty after washing. “Toni rang me and said that he and his four friends want to put up a fashion firm, but the group still lacks someone creative,” Muurimäki says. It turned out that Muurimäki’s own idea of a functional, comfortable, and good quality men’s collection suited the quartet’s plans perfectly. A limited company was registered last year, and it had five owners: Muurimäki, Tervilä,  ,   and  . CEO Tervilä has a business degree, engineer Jokinen is in charge of production and Muurimäki takes care of the creative aspects. “Toni and Pentti had zero experience in the fashion industry, so for starters I gave them a bit of an intensive course on textile technology.” The ideology of the brand is to create the world’s best shirt, button up shirt, underwear and blazer. Whilst figuring out which materials to use the men came up with merino wool, which is commonly used in outdoor and sports clothing. The clothes are designed for athletic and quality-aware adults, and the aim is to make every piece of clothing worth its price by making it durable and easy to maintain. They started ordering samples of clothes made of merino wool from abroad. “We came to the conclusion that merino wool is the best possible material,” says Muurimäki. In addition to merino wool, Formal Friday’s products are made of organic cotton and linen. The selection consists of different types of tops, underwear and a tie that was inspired by the desire to reduce wasting fabric. The clothes are designed for athletic and quality-aware adults, and the aim is to make every piece of clothing worth its price by making it durable and easy to maintain. Additionally, the style is classic and timeless, so it won’t grow old when new trends step in. According to Muurimäki, Formal Friday is the only European company that produces button up shirts made of merino wool. The fabric is ordered from a US-based subcontractor, which produces its textiles in Thailand. The wool itself is gathered from all over the world, because the producers of merino wool are few and far between. Jerseys are sewn in Finland, shirts in Tallinn, Estonia, and blazers in Lithuania. Formal Friday wanted to keep production lines as close to home as possible for the sake of the environment and making surveillance easier. “We know exactly where our products come from,” Muurimäki promises. Corporate social responsibility is a big thing in the fashion industry, because its reputation is not great when it comes to labour rights or environmental issues. The producer bears the main responsibility, but Muurimäki points out that consumers have power over it, too. “If a piece of clothing is so cheap that the material itself should cost more, a consumer should presume it was made in a sweatshop.” Muurimäki believes there’s a change in the making. In the future customers will want less stuff, but of better quality. Formal Friday’s online store concept is innovative – and quite likely unheard of. On the front page, the visitor can choose a model closest to his own size and go through the collection seeing that model wears every size of each item from three different angles. 1 500 photos were taken on a military schedule in just one day. None of the models were professionals; instead, they were friends or acquaintances of the five owners. The idea has worked well, because Formal Friday has had hardly anyone return their orders. During the first months of business they received orders from all over Europe, the United States and Australia. It’s been common for customers to say they found Formal Friday whilst looking for fashion made of merino wool. The next step is to grow the collection with bottom parts, such as trousers, so that a full outfit is available. At some point Formal Friday might expand to women’s clothes, which are what Muurimäki has built his career on. The focus is on the international market. Muurimäki knows the fashion industry and its realities. “For example Italy, France, and Spain are difficult, because they’ve got their own fashion in abundance. We’re particularly interested in Northern Europe and the US, and the Japanese market has got a lot of potential for Finnish products as well.” Formal Friday’s online store concept is innovative – and quite likely unheard of. The visitor can choose a model closest to his own size and go through the collection seeing that model wears every size of each item."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vikings-of-brazil-brings-nordic-stories-to-brazil/,Vikings of Brazil brings Nordic Stories to Brazil,"Pasi and Lilia Loman’s Vikings of Brazil has at least doubled the selection of Nordic literature in Brazil. Next thing on the list might be movies and television shows, both of which have a much larger potential audience in the country than literature. The existence of   is, even if indirectly, due to the cartoonist and children’s author  . “I was sitting in my kitchen eating and spotted the English version of one of Mauri Kunnas’ books on the shelf. I started to wonder if it’s ever been published in Brazil. I wasn’t thinking about business, it was all out of mere curiosity that I started digging into it,” says Pasi Loman. It turned out that the author’s books had been translated into dozens of languages, but none were available in Brazil. Loman was surprised: books this popular and well-sold, and a country this big? It seemed as though Nordic literature was anything but present in the Brazilian market. Loman started contacting Nordic publishers to ask if he could start marketing their books in Brazil. Practically all the biggest publishers got excited about his idea. “Many of them probably just thought they’ve got nothing to lose, so let’s let him give it a go,” Loman says laughingly. To start with, Loman already had a convincing list of Nordic authors and books that had been sold in many corners of the world. According to him, many Brazilian publishers were almost surprised they hadn’t heard about the books earlier. Some Brazilian publishers say that Finnish stories take place in a setting too foreign for Brazilians. Others are happy to let readers travel to new worlds. Some companies brought up a problem: they don’t know anyone who could translate from Icelandic or Danish into Brazilian Portuguese. Loman wasn’t left speechless. “I’d predicted that question and compiled a list of translators with skills in Nordic languages and Brazilian Portuguese. So essentially, I offered the publishers good books and contacts to get them translated.” In the first year, 2012, Loman expected   to sell a handful of books. He ended up signing about fifty deals, and the following year another fifty. Last year the number was over a hundred. About a third of the books are Finnish. “The change is quite radical in comparison to when the only names known in Brazil were   and  . Due to Vikings of Brazil, the volume of Nordic literature in the Brazilian market is likely to have at least doubled.” Loman and his wife translate from Finnish to Portuguese together. That way there is a native speaker on both ends. For other Nordic languages publishers find other translators – mostly from the list Loman provides them. “Some translators have looked me up on Facebook and sent me a message to say thank you after hearing I’ve been the one to give the publisher their contact details.” This means Loman doesn’t only translate, but also acts as an agent between publishers. When they seal a deal, Vikings of Brazil gets a slice of the price. Nordic literature is known around the world for its high quality. For example,  . In the case of Loman, marketing Nordic literature was the only feasible option. He had moved to Brazil with his wife and had zero experience or contacts in publishing. “Had I started offering similar services to US publishers, they would’ve laughed it off. As a Finn I was given a chance to show what I’m capable of.” Just being Nordic is not a selling point for a book. Loman says Vikings of Brazil sells primarily good books – it just happens that they’re Nordic. Loman chooses all the books himself. Some Brazilian publishers say that Finnish stories take place in a setting too foreign for Brazilians. Others are happy to let readers travel to new worlds. Books go both ways; Vikings of Brazil has helped Finland to find Brazilian books to read. Expanding to other Latin American countries would require Spanish skills. One option is to employ someone to handle sales outside of Brazil. Another, more likely option is to focus on Brazil and start importing films and television programmes alongside with literature. In Brazil, films are more in demand than books simply because a big proportion of the country’s citizens lack in literacy skills. Hence there are more potential viewers than readers. “If we can find suitable partners, I’m almost certain we can reach results similar to those we’ve had with literature.”   How it all started: “I was sitting in my kitchen eating and spotted the English version of one of Mauri Kunnas’ books on the shelf. I started to wonder if it’s ever been published in Brazil. I wasn’t thinking about business, it was all out of mere curiosity that I started digging into it,” says Pasi Loman, founder of Vikings of Brazil.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/entocube-bitten-by-the-philanthropic-bug/,EntoCube bitten by the philanthropic bug,"As insect consumption becomes less of a taboo on the Western market, this Finnish startup is tackling other worldly concerns. The backstreets of Beijing’s Dongcheng District are cluttered with various market stalls. Among these, long wooden skewers lie in perfect formation showcasing a range of delicacies. At first glance, they appear to be unremarkable; a snack while ambling through the backstreets and alleyways of China’s capital. Closer inspection reveals something altogether more striking: rows of scorpions, cicadas and silkworms, their unfamiliar culinary temptation simultaneously shocking and intriguing for passing throngs of tourists. But, what if we lived in a world where such creepy-crawly consumption was commonplace? Oh, wait a minute, we do! Whilst Western culture is restrained by taboos surrounding the practise, some 80 per cent of the global population consumes insects as part of their regular diet. On paper it’s easy to see why. Often containing higher levels of protein than fish and lower in fat, their benefits extend beyond nutrition. Farming insects consumes around 1 000 times less water than beef, and has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 per cent. “There are about 2 000 edible insects,” confirms  ’s  . “Most [Western] people are turning to insects because they are so much more efficient.” Case-in-point is the EntoCube, a refitted shipping container that utilises food scraps to harvest between 10-15 000 insects daily. “That’s pretty much five kilos a day for food,” his colleague   emphasises. “Or more than one-and-a-half tonnes per year.” Founded a year ago by Karjalainen, Palonen,  and  , EntoCube is located at Aalto University’s Startup Sauna. At full capacity, the Cube can house half a million European house crickets in various stages of development. However, although they can fetch up to 80 euros per kilogram on the chic Western market, the crickets are not being refined into powder. EU restrictions on such commerce have seen EntoCube turn its sights towards a more pressing global concern. “Our endgame is ending world hunger,” Karjalainen outlines. With an estimated 805 million people worldwide currently undernourished, this is no small task. Thus Entocube is first strengthening its local collaboration. “The first ten-or-so Cubes we want to sell here in the Nordics and Baltics,” Nemlander explains. “We are not only selling the Cubes, but also the initial population and education as to how to get the most out of this. Then we are moving into the Southeast Asian market.” Focusing on a region where eating whole insects is a common practise, the team seeks collaboration with NGOs or governmental organisations dealing with food and development aid, in order to bring their self-sufficient solution as close to the end users as possible. “The idea is not only about bringing people food, it’s about giving them livelihood so they make profit,” Palonen explains. “You can use it to feed yourself and your family, but also sell the rest of the insects. Five kilos a day is plenty.” With crickets priced at around 2.50 euros per kilogram in Cambodia, utilising EntoCube has the potential to boost an individual’s annual income to 4 000 euros – quadruple the average. The Cube could also act as a commercial disposal point for expired foodstuffs, and even help turn gardens into a complete ecosystem by utilising cricket droppings as fertilizer. This all lies ahead. For the time being the quartet is seeking a capital boost from angel investors. “Nobody will solve world hunger by accident,” Nemlander reminds. “That’s the main key.” The Cube has a capacity of around half a million insects. Perttu Karjalainen (left) and Hannes Sjöblad reveal its inner workings."

Information is shared for free, and its business lies in selling home tests. In April the company was included in the Top 100 list of the most promising European startups by US media company Red Herring. Google can make anyone a little hypochondriacal. When one looks up explanations for a splitting headache or inexplicable bruises, the search results always include the worst possible options. Online health service   wants to – literally – ease the pain. On MediGoo’s website, anyone can type in their symptoms and find articles packed with information about possible illnesses and their treatment, and order home tests to either indicate or rule out a diagnosis. “We want to provide information that’s of better quality than what the Internet normally offers. By testing themselves people find out whether or not there’s a real reason to worry,” says the company’s COO  . The articles are written by medical professionals, and they’re available for everyone free of charge. There is an evident demand for information: the majority of the website’s visitors come through search engines. The tests range from checking cholesterol levels to finding out if there is a genetic predisposition to diabetes or Alzheimer’s. Karhuniemi says that what makes MediGoo stand out among its competitors is that the company wants to offer the whole package at one go; it doesn’t only state the current situation, but gives advice as to how to go about it. For example, if cholesterol levels are too high, MediGoo gives advice how to reduce them, and the test for borreliosis includes a tick removal tool. MediGoo was founded in 2007 by a team of four, but the size and content of the team have changed since. Now the responsibility lies on the shoulders of Karhiniemi and CEO  , who own the company together with a third person. The website was launched in November last year, seven years after the registration of the company. Karilahti points out that compiling a collection of high quality, comprehensible medical articles took three-and-a-half years, and in the beginning the entrepreneurs worked on MediGoo alongside with their other projects. Now the website has almost 2 000 articles, all of which are written by MediGoo’s international network. Last year MediGoo made it on the Red Herring top 100 Europe list. When all the hard work was finally published, Karilahti says he was relieved. “It didn’t last long though, as the page collapsed on its very first day,” he says and bursts out laughing. The problem was solved, and now the website functions on computers, tablets and smartphones. There’s still work to be done, as Karilahti hopes to see the page become faster than it is now. In addition to the three owners, MediGoo has six local employees in Ukraine. They take care of the website, coding, social media and marketing. Karilahti says that the annual list by the US media company has been criticised for its high fees, but he deems that for MediGoo the investment proved worthwhile. “We got to talk with successful entrepreneurs in similar fields, and we were given very useful advice.” Whilst preparing their presentation for the Red Herring event Karilahti and Karhiniemi realised that they need to expand their business model. In the future, MediGoo will be looking into expanding the availability of its products to not only consumers, but also the public sector. Getting the tests onto the shelves of specialised stores is another option. “Our vision is that in five years the tests are so well known that they can be bought in local supermarkets,” says Karilahti. Right now MediGoo is aiming at the international market. The website currently only exists in English, and a Finnish version is not being planned for the immediate future. More widely used languages take precedence over smaller ones, and the user instructions of each product are translated every time an order comes in from a new country. The majority of the website’s visitors are from the United States. The North American market is huge and hence interesting. Karilahti mentions that in the case of the US the liability issue keeps companies offering medical services wary. “Companies are on their toes, because they’re concerned about getting sued. Getting things started in Europe will help moving on to the US, too.” MediGoo offers the whole package; it doesn’t only state the current health situation, but gives advice as to how to go about it."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cracking-the-code/,Cracking the code,"JavaScript will become the most spoken language in the world – the new lingua franca that women in particular should learn to speak more. A trainee from Good News from Finland attended a Rails Girls event one weekend to learn how to code.  My first impression: there are surprisingly many men at this event intended for women. Before the laptops are opened up, we find out that these coke-swigging men are our coaches. Their goal is to explain to technology-ignorant people like me the difference between HTML and CSS, why JavaScript is important, and how Ruby is related to Rails. My ignorance has not been a conscious choice; rather, in the face of complicated “IT stuff”, my brain involuntarily switches to SYNTAX ERROR mode. I have always considered myself a slow learner, especially when it comes to languages. And now I’m trying to learn coding without even mastering the basic 10-finger typing system. I’m sitting on the couch, watching people mosey about. As is to be expected, quite a diverse crowd has gathered, with the participants ranging in age from 20-something to middle age. I’m in a group with two teachers.  and   heard about Rails Girls at a teaching seminar where the importance of coding was discussed. “I’m a human guinea pig,” says Lyyra, who teaches Finnish in upper secondary school. “I decided two years ago to properly learn how to use a computer.” Coding will be part of the Finnish primary school curriculum in 2016, and Kaisto, who works as a guidance counsellor, wants to understand what coding is all about. “Girls are being encouraged to enter technical fields, so it will be good to know what we’re dealing with in practice,” she says. Rails Girls was founded in 2010 when   asked her friends to teach her about coding. Today, her and  ’s Rails Girls event is organised regularly around the world. In May alone, workshops were held in Poland, the UK, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Rails Girls participants are not required to have any prior knowledge of coding. The coding workshops are free, last one or two days, and are aimed at girls and women. They go over the basics of programming and teach the participants how to speak “nerd” and build a simple web service. After those basics, Ruby on Rails is installed on the participants’ laptops. I’m still not really sure who Ruby is. The first commands are entered in the ‘terminal’, meaning the computer’s own command system. I copy parts from the Rails Girls website and dutifully enter them in the terminal. The group members become acquainted with one another. I understand that having a gap in my technological understanding is not exclusive to me. In her Slush speech in November 2014, Rails Girls founder Liukas said that the increase in programming and technology does not mean that the gap between two opposing ideologies – mathematics/logic and arts – will widen. “Coding can be like poetry,” she said. The terminal is abuzz with numbers and words. Could this be the poetry she’s talking about? On the second day of the workshop, I learn that Ruby is one of many programming languages – one of the easiest. And it works on Rails, a framework for creating web apps. Exactly what we’re here to do today. Now it’s time to get to the matter at hand. Our coding coach  guides us through the first phase. We build a web app piece by piece, one command row at a time. Luontola patiently visits every participant to fix commands that have been entered in the wrong window and explains what happens before each phase. I coded something on my page! A sound reflecting childlike wonder escapes from my lips. The button UPLOAD PICTURE has appeared on my page. I did it by entering command rows in various windows, which there are so many of that I can’t even keep up. Next I change the font. Maybe red, there we go. After the first hour, my brain feels like it’s going to explode. I’m hungry, thirsty and have to go to the loo all at the same time. I tank on the offering of soft drinks. I add photos and headlines to my page. I edit them and change the colours. I put inspiring pictures and text on my page. I’ve created a new Pinterest! I silently scream in my head. The person next to me has made more progress than me, coding commentary possibilities for her page presenting places to visit in Helsinki. I go say hi to Lyyra and Kaisto, who are working on the other side of the room. By the end of the day, Lyyra has coded a web page dedicated to gourds. Her fonts, photos and infotext are all in their proper place. Kaisto confesses to feeling discouraged at times during the coding, but now she is very pleased: “If I, a complete self-confessed arts enthusiast, can take this course, anyone can.” It has been a long day. Some people have already retired to the couches to hang out and listen to music, while others can’t take their eyes off their screen. I decide to go home because I am completely knackered. At home I sit out on my balcony, exhausted. The clear, bright sun sets beyond the adjacent block of flats. My brain has absorbed so much information that my synapses are no longer able to fire normally. I start thinking about mundane things. The week ahead. Cleaning. I try to remember whose turn it is to clean next week, mine or my roommate’s. A thought flashes across my mind: Should I code a cleaning list for us? A web app nears completion after many hours of hard work."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/slurp-brings-artisan-roasteries-to-finns-doorsteps/,Slurp brings artisan roasteries to Finns’ doorsteps,"In recent years, many small companies roasting coffee beans with expertise and dedication have popped up in Finland. Local company Slurp wishes to spread the word on these micro-roasteries – also outside Finland’s borders. “When you first taste the perfectly extracted, freshly roasted coffee from an artisan roastery, you become momentarily confused. Is this really coffee? Then you realise that you’ve been fooled your entire life,” laughs  , one of  ’s trio of founders. The two other founding members of the company, brothers  and  , nod in agreement. Their personal passion for aromatic coffee led the men to establish the company in the summer of 2014. It enables consumers to effortlessly order fresh artisan coffee straight to their doorsteps. Slurp, which has been delivering orders for over four months, has been welcomed with open arms by both customers and roasteries. On Slurp’s website, customers can select whether they want their coffee as a dark, light or espresso roast. Then the desired amount of coffee arrives in their mailboxes every two weeks. Slurp delivers coffees from twelve different Finnish micro-roasteries, ground according to the customer’s preferences, ranging from beans to filter coffee. Each time something different arrives in the mail and within a year the customer can sample a total of 26 different types of coffee. Slurp’s owners, with their discriminating taste buds, personally select the coffees that they send their customers. “The green coffee beans arrive from overseas, of course, but the roasteries have a huge impact on the end flavour,” says Manuel. “Coffee hand-roasted in Finland is an interesting product that is a joy to be able to provide. We just received some coffee from Punainen Kirahvi for sampling. The small roastery from Jyväskylä makes the coffee using a roaster that holds around one kilogram.” They say that Finns always pack three things with them when they head overseas: salty liquorice, rye bread and coffee. Finns’ fascination with coffee seems to be a mystery, even to the Nordic people themselves. Slurp’s Rafael Linnankoski has his own interesting theory on the subject: The Finnish company Slurp sends its customers coffees from 12 micro-roasteries every two weeks. Its advantage is delivery straight to the customer’s doorstep. A delivery fresh from Turun kahvipaahtimo. “Maybe coffee seemed like a luxury product after the war. It has grown to be part of our culture on a conceptual level and is somehow perfect for this climate. It’s dark for most of the year, after all. A cup of coffee in the morning really helps to wake you up when you’re waiting for the sun to rise in four hours’ time!” The volume of Finnish coffee consumption is also proven by statistics: according to the Finnish Coffee and Roasters Association, 63 million kilograms of raw coffee were delivered to Finland in 2013. According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), Finns drink 12 kilograms of raw coffee per person each year. This amount is staggering, taking into consideration that Italians, a well-known nation of coffee drinkers, consume only 5.7 kilograms in the same amount of time. Of all the coffee consumed in Finland, lightly roasted coffee makes up around 86 per cent. It has maintained its popularity over the years and Finns prepare it, almost without exception, using a coffeemaker. Despite being set in their ways, the coffee culture of Finns has been changing for some time now: quality-conscious Finnish consumers are now increasingly looking for aromatic coffee and a darker roast. Specialised coffeemakers have also begun showing up in Finnish homes. Lightly roasted Finnish coffee brewed in clean water is exotic, and therefore something that Slurp’s owners believe will prove to be a huge hit on global markets. “Not many, either abroad or even here in Finland, are aware of how many micro-roasteries making high-quality coffee, even by international standards, this country has,” says Manuel. “Micro-roasteries’ coffee is very different from, for example, Italian coffee that is traditionally very darkly roasted. It is roasted to a degree where the coffee’s properties are highlighted as much as possible.” Slurp is planning to begin deliveries abroad within the space of a few months. They may launch things from Germany as marketing in German is not a problem for the bilingual Linnankoski brothers. The Slurp trio intends to be Finland’s first company supplying micro-roasteries’ coffees on a global level, and taking over Europe is a good place from which to start their global domination. The men feel that they are riding the crest of the new coffee culture wave, which is in the process of finding its bearings. “Actually, our goal is to surf ahead of the wave,” says Rafael, with a grin. “The wave is what carries us forward.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/abu-dhabi-nursery-teaches-the-finnish-way/,Abu Dhabi nursery teaches the Finnish way,"Kipinä Kids offers a playful environment to inspire lifelong learning in children. The sun-drenched city of Abu Dhabi is known for many things, but no matter how hard the imagination may try, an abundance of grass is not among them. Thus, it is a pleasant surprise to discover that a burst of green lawn enlivens the yard of   nursery, located in the Al Bateen district. “We wanted to give the kids the opportunity to just run and play, to be free,” explains  , Kipinä’s Canadian co-director. “We also have a spot in the garden to grow things, such as plants and vegetables.” Aside from the finely manicured grass out front, what further distinguishes the nursery from its contemporaries around town is that it has embraced the Finnish model of education as its curriculum, rather than the predominant UK and American models typically on offer. “When we were planning Kipinä we set out with the intention to create a unique programme that focused on developing an innovation mindset and was different to what was already in the market,” Brucker recalls. “We asked our partner,  , a 30-year career educator, who was the best in education in the world. She said if we want that we need to look at what Finland is doing.” Since opening its doors on 11 January, the nursery has infused its environment with a variety of Finnish influences. Favouring direct instruction, the teacher has a very participatory role in the classroom, similar to Finland’s modelling approach. Teachers are also entrusted with the autonomy to design the learning experience themselves, utilising their professional judgment. Kipinä is also dressed in a minimalist style, with natural walls and wooden floors. Green lawn enlivens the yard of Kipinä Kids nursery, where the kids have the opportunity to run and play. The nursery also has a spot in the garden to grow things, such as plants and vegetables. Topping off the Finnish flavour,  ’s famed ceramic dogs are the nursery’s mascot, with the playful functionality of the designer’s work reflecting Kipinä’s educational perspective. “We remind parents that even though we have the curriculum and the teaching programme, children learn through play and having fun,” explains principal  , a Finn with 15 years of experience teaching early childhood education. “The holistic perspective for their development is all happening through play.” This playful approach incorporates smart boards, tablets and other technologies to inspire a mindset of innovation and entrepreneurship. The word Kipinä itself reflects this ignition of youthful imaginations, meaning ‘spark’ in Finnish. “Our goal is to help the kids grow into independent thinkers,” Brucker states. “What we hope to do with them here is to set them on a trajectory to become lifelong learners.” Currently there are over 40 youngsters attending Kipinä, aged four months to four years. While predominantly expatriates, the philosophy of a Finnish approach is increasingly seeing locals enrol their children. “The UAE is on an innovation path similar to Finland’s, so Emirati parents are very responsive to what we are doing,” Brucker explains. “They get excited to see their kids with different nationalities as well.” At Kipinä Kids nursery children learn through play and having fun The international environment is also reflected in backgrounds of the teaching staff, each of which has either an early childhood or primary education degree. As the nursery gradually fills towards its capacity of youngsters, attention is now turning to expanding the idea to other locations around the region. To meet this demand, Kipinä is keen to embellish their staff with more Finns. “We are looking to do alliances with Finnish universities, so that after teachers graduate with either their BA or MA in Education, we would love to have them come and work for us for a year or two,” Brucker enthuses. “We would give them accommodation, provide them with Arabic lessons and they would get their practical experience working at Kipinä.” And so, as this Finnish concept continues to grow, it appears the sight of grass in the hot desert climate is destined to become increasingly more common in future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lumine-helps-cities-see-the-light/,Lumine helps cities see the light,"Automated street lighting activated by presence detection promises significant reductions in energy wastage costs. Have you ever found yourself alone walking home late one evening? No cars on the road, no one else on the footpath. Whilst it may feel like a scene from a movie, just you and the midnight quiet, does it not feel just a little bit strange that the lights are always on, illuminating the din whilst everyone else is tucked in bed? Surely it would make more sense if the area was lit up only when people were around. Finnish company   has come up with a way to tackle this problem. Reducing energy consumption by approximately 70 per cent, their intelligent street lighting solution is based on presence detection. “We are saving energy by dimming down the luminescence in areas where there is no use for light,” says CEO  . “We are also reducing light pollution without sacrificing the comfortability and security gained by lighting.” The wireless interlinked system works by illuminating all nearby units to a brighter level once movement is detected. Specifications are adjusted remotely via online map-based tool Lumine Manager that provides information pertaining to the system. Costly inspection rounds are also a thing of the past, with the system easily notifying maintenance teams of any problems such as lamp failure. Simple as that. Given the number of sun-averse months experienced here in Finland each year, it’s perhaps no surprise that the idea first came to Oksanen a couple of years ago in the midst of winter. Lumine’s wireless interlinked system works by illuminating all nearby units to a brighter level once movement is detected. “I was skiing and it was dark outside and I started wondering why are all these lights at full power even though there was no one outside,” he recalls. “I wondered if it should be done more smartly.” After some time spent ascertaining the market possibilities, Oksanen concluded that “there seemed to be huge saving potential and demand also.” Recruiting   to assist him, together they set to work building prototypes that built upon Oksanen’s idea of presence detection. The duo raised private equity last autumn to commence running trials of their solution. Furthering their momentum, they then received additional financing from Finnish innovation funding agency Tekes. “The Tekes funding lowered the risk to do such development work that will not pay off immediately,” Oksanen explains. “It has been very crucial for the future of the company. As an R&D project, it has gone well; what was planned was achieved.” Lumine has successfully sold trial projects to cities around Finland, garnering a positive response. Pedestrians and cyclists have applauded its subtle nature, meeting the design goal that the system is unnoticeable. “Currently we have ongoing projects in Joensuu, Kotka, Turku, Salo and Espoo,” Oksanen states. “We are looking for around five to ten more in Finland.” And it’s not just local areas that are set to benefit in the future. “We are expanding abroad, hoping to get trial projects in a few cities in Spain, Great Britain and Denmark.” Interest is illuminating, slowly but surely. In the meantime, Oksanen is waiting patiently for the floodlight of wider acceptance to be switched on in the near future. “Although all cities and municipalities like the idea, they are quite careful with their decisions,” he explains, keeping an eye on the bigger picture. “It takes some time to build up and win their trust that this kind of technology will work. But, as a taxpayer, at least I can say it’s good that they are quite careful about their spending.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/idean-challenges-world-s-biggest-it-companies-in-silicon-valley/,Idean challenges world’s biggest IT companies in Silicon Valley,"The journey of global design company Idean hasn’t been smooth sailing. Five years ago co-founder and CEO Risto Lähdesmäki left for Silicon Valley to explore the atmosphere, thinking it’s now or never. The risk proved worthwhile: now the company works for multinational corporations and employs some of the world’s best creative talent. It can be hard to point out a flaw in a malfunctioning website or mobile application. The user just   something isn’t quite right. That’s where   steps in. The firm’s goal is to create excellent user interfaces even when it’s not fully clear what’s expected of them. In order to tackle this mission impossible, Idean uses a 4D-model:  ,  ,   and  . “First we familiarise ourselves with the customer’s problem, which we do by observing the target audience and searching for friction. We’ve probably been to every city in the world and places like Moroccan mines to see what the everyday reality of the users is like,” CEO Lähdesmäki says.  is when the service is conceptualised according to needs and expectations, and   begins the concrete planning process of a perfect user experience.   refers to the actual delivery. Idean’s services are a multidisciplinary combination of varying fields of work. Researchers and service designers come up with what needs to be done, coders do it, and art directors make it nice to look at and interact with. Lähdesmäki says that all of their staff members share energy and passion for what they’re doing. “We love our work so much we wrote   about it.” A song for the company is a natural part of Idean’s story: the first logos and adverts Lähdesmäki designed were inspired by music. “I played the keyboard when I was young. I had to do something sensible to be able to afford buying instruments.” The first steps of the firm were taken two decades ago, when Lähdesmäki founded his own advertising agency. Later he founded another company that focused on usability research. Idean has managed to establish a place for itself in Silicon Valley’s highly competitive market: “In the beginning we made all sorts of mistakes in terms of business, but our design team has been outstanding all the time. Now we’ve got a focus and the best talents in the world,” says Idean CEO Risto Lähdesmäki. “At the time we did things that are very different to what we do today. We tried figuring out stuff like why VHS recorders are so hard to program.” Idean as we know it now saw daylight in 2003, when Lähdesmäki merged his two companies. It all started with the help of one friend, but soon the staff number started growing. Lähdesmäki describes the first ten years as a bit of a rollercoaster. “At times things weren’t going that great. We wasted away more than a million in China, and then the recession hit.” Lähdesmäki wanted to give up, but first he decided to give it all or nothing. He booked a flight to California and left for Silicon Valley to see if there was room for Idean in the highly competitive market. Now Idean has over 170 employees, and it’s likely to reach 200 by the end of the year. The company is based in Palo Alto, and it has studios and bureaus in Austin, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, Helsinki and Tampere. “In the beginning we made all sorts of mistakes in terms of business, but our design team has been outstanding all the time. Now we’ve got a focus and the best talents in the world.” Five years ago Idean had 100 projects; last year it had 300. Lähdesmäki says he decided to leave for Silicon Valley, because he wanted to be where words are born – not where they are copied. Almost all of the biggest phenomena in the present day have been created in Silicon Valley, within miles of each other. “It’s not enough to be the best runner in the world, if you don’t go to the Olympics,” Lähdesmäki points out. Because skills and knowledge are top notch all over the area, competition is tough. Idean isn’t the only one in its field in California. “A well-known private investor told me we came to the Sahara to sell sand,” Lähdesmäki says laughingly. Idean has managed to establish itself among other sand-sellers. Now its customer base includes names such as Honda, Volkswagen, Gopro, and Samsung. Idean also won a design competition by IBM, which made Idean the company’s partner in what Lähdesmäki describes as “the world’s biggest design transformation project”. Idean’s management is mainly Finnish, but the studios are led by locals. The whole IT industry, let alone Silicon Valley, sees vigorous competition in recruitment. The best people are free to choose for whom to work. According to Lähdesmäki, Idean wants to be the most wanted in the eyes of both customers and employees. “Our goal is to grow and conquer new corners of the world, but level-headedly.” Idean is based in Palo Alto, and it has studios and bureaus in Austin, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, Helsinki and Tampere."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mehackit-takes-robots-to-high-school/,Mehackit takes robots to high school,"Mehackit’s goal is to enable high school students to get to grips with new technology, robotics and programming. In future, the Finnish concept may be heading to other Nordic countries. At  ’s Helsinki office a battery-operated robot zooms around on the wooden table, bumping into coffee cups and milk cartons. Any high school student could, in practice, build one of these robots. But why would anyone want to build a robot? And why is it so important to build one? “The idea is to encourage young people to actualise their ideas using technology,” says  , founder of Mehackit. In November 2014, Kekäläinen stood on the Silver Stage at Slush, dressed appropriately in a silver jumpsuit, to talk about Mehackit, the organisation she had established. At the end of her talk, Kekäläinen revealed some big news: Mehackit’s new partner would be the electronics giant Samsung. When released, the vibrating robot draws patterns on paper. Before stepping out in front of the audience at Slush, she had done a multitude of things, such as working in India and studying business in Vienna. Upon returning to Finland she worked at the Foreign Ministry and the Aalto Entrepreneurship Society. “I worked with   [founder of Rails Girls] on a project. Pretty quickly I got involved in Rails Girls,” Kekäläinen says. Rails Girls is a workshop designed for women that teaches coding. The event began as a project between friends and accidentally grew into a worldwide phenomenon. Kekäläinen was there to witness how teaching coding spread around the world. A couple years of intensive work sparked her interest in doing something similar. Early on, the concept did not have a clear shape. To begin with, Kekäläinen organised workshops for 6–12-year-old children in which volunteers helped to introduce them to all types of technology. The list included 3D printers, motion detectors, electronics, robotics, coding, but also art. The next step was to draw a clear line. The problem was inequality. It was the parents who were themselves interested in technology that brought their kids to the workshops. Kekäläinen felt that everybody should be able to take part in the courses, even the children whose parents were not into technology. They decided to target high schools. Kekäläinen and her team organised an after-work event for high school teachers curious about the idea. Those who were interested got to try coding and building a mini robot. Today, Mehackit offers Finnish high school students two elective courses: “Electronics and robotics” and “Introduction to the world of programming”. In 2015 and in spring 2016, teachers trained by Mehackit will be holding courses at more than 25 schools in eight Finnish cities. The idea is to get one student from each city’s university of technology to teach one course of programming or robotics to high school students. Mehackit takes care of training the teachers and coordinating courses. The Mehackit course is free for the schools and does not require them to commit long-term. The course involves open teaching material and open source-code software and applications. Teaching equipment and small material purchases, such as electronic components, are considered separately at each school. The purpose of the course is to function as an inspiration for future career choices. Young people notice how easy it really is to code their own website or build something real using a 3D printer, for example. Will all children become coders based on a single course? Or robot manufacturers? Kekäläinen compares coding to playing the piano. Nobody becomes a pianist after just one month of practice, learning is a never-ending journey. “With at least one coder at every workplace in the future, it is important to understand exactly what they are doing. You need to speak their language,” she says. “I want to see how kids are building their futures and we are trying to bring new influences from the technology and startup fields to those who might consider these areas difficult to approach.” In the future, Mehackit wishes to offer courses of varied duration to people of different age groups. Kekäläinen’s goal is for Mehackit to become obsolete in the future. “I hope that these things will be taught in schools without our help,” she says. That may, however, take a while. In the meanwhile Mehackit is heading to Stockholm’s Tekniska Museet where it will hold an after-work event for Swedish teachers. The aim is to get the teachers excited about the coding and robotics.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lamor-cleans-oil-spills-from-the-jungles-to-the-arctic/,Lamor cleans oil spills from the jungles to the Arctic,"Despite all the precautions and the best of intentions, sometimes accidents happen. If your accident is knocking over a glass of milk there is nothing to cry about. If your accident is an oil spill in a pristine environment, then tears would not be out of place. Cleaning up oil spills is a demanding job which requires specialised equipment and technology. One Finnish company has made it their mission to clean up such messes everywhere from South American jungles to Arctic oceans.  was founded in the early 1980s by the Larsen family, who continue to own and operate the company. They focus on oil spill response equipment as well as the treatment of contaminated soil and water. Lamor’s CEO Fred Larsen inspecting pumps at Gulf of Mexico spill. “Our soil and water remediation solution is the patented EKO/GRID technology for the treatment of polluted areas,” says CEO  . “The technology can be applied to a wide range of soil and fluid types, ranging from mildly polluted industrial sites to tank bottom sludge. The cleaning effect is based on a 100 per cent eco-friendly oxidation process initiated by electro-kinetic and electro-osmotic principles.” Lamor conducted field tests of drilling waste and tank bottom sludge and reduced total petroleum hydrocarbons by 50 per cent. The tests were conducted in Ecuador, where the company also made an investment in the environmental service firm Corena. “Oil spills have no borders, so our business is focused on providing the most technologically advanced solutions to customers worldwide,” Larsen says. “Indeed there are pipeline incidents in South America; exploration has its hazards too in that region. To ensure a strong market position we made an investment in Corena, who is a long-term partner of Lamor.” The Porvoo-based company produces a wide range of oil spill recovery systems, such as booms which contain spills and skimmers which separate oil floating on water. They have also developed pumps, vehicle systems and machines which clean rocky shorelines. Some of these systems are designed for harsh Arctic conditions. The ship-mounted Sternmax is the world’s largest high-capacity ice-crushing oil skimmer, and the company has also participated in constructing the   icebreaker. “The   is intended for icebreaking, emergency and rescue operations coupled with oil spill recovery tasks in Russian Arctic conditions,” Larsen continues. “The advanced Lamor inbuilt oil recovery system is suitable for operations in heavy seas.” He explains that the vertical side of the hull is utilised as a sweep arm. The ship moves sideways through oil spills and the oily water comes through a hull hatch to the brush skimmers and tank compartment. “Moreover, one of its unique features is the patented icebreaking solution – ARC 100 concept – which was developed by Aker Arctic Technology specifically for the Arctech Helsinki Shipyard,” says Larsen. “The ARC 100 features the oblique design with an asymmetric hull and three Steerprop pulling azimuth propulsors that allow the vessel to manoeuvre effectively in all directions.” Having such equipment will become increasingly important with increased petroleum exploration in the Arctic. Finnish cold weather and technological expertise will help clean up any spills which happen. The Finnish company Lamor cleans oil spills in harsh conditions, everywhere from the hot jungles of Ecuador to the frozen Arctic Sea."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/aiscreen-transforms-sports-spectator-experience/,AiScreen transforms sports spectator experience,"AiScreen, a startup company from Tampere, has taken on a current topic: sports data. Established two years ago, the company offers digital tracking services for team sports, which benefit sports teams, leagues, the media and betting companies. “The digital tracking of sports is a hot topic at the moment, for which solutions are being sought across sports boundaries,” says  ’s CEO  . “This is part of a global trend where young people are spending an increasing amount of time online. It also changes spectator sports and the related experience. Big players like the NBA, NHL and European soccer leagues are currently investing strongly in the development of digital tracking for games.” Aiscreen’s answer to the growing demand is technology based on machine vision, which is used to track the movements of players and equipment in team sports. In an ice hockey game, for example, when a player attempts to shoot a goal, the technology immediately reports the speed of the shot and the distance between the players. The new technology provides real-time data on the positions of each player and piece of equipment, and their speed and direction. “We install pairs of lights and machine vision cameras above the arena or the game area, and use a wave length of light that is invisible to the naked eye. Each player and piece of equipment has a unique signature that reflects light, which is what the machine vision tracks. There is no need to install anything in the player’s gear,” says Kuro. During the game the machine vision camera sends the data to a computer at the game venue, which processes the data and sends it to a cloud service. From there the processed data is available for use or distribution. Data from sources other than the cameras can also be directed to the cloud service, for example from the players’ heart rate monitors. It is possible to track any team sport using the technology, but AiScreen started with ice hockey. According to Mika-Petteri Kuro, AiScreen’s vision is for ice hockey to be unable to function without the company’s data collection system within a few years. There has been particular demand in the sport for the technology and ice hockey is an excellent reference: when it is possible to prove that the technology can track a piece of equipment as small and fast as a hockey puck, there can be no doubt that it will also be capable of tracking a basketball, for example. Possible clients of Aiscreen’s services range from sports teams and leagues to the media and betting companies. Teams and leagues can utilise the technology above all for entertaining the fans, for example, by organising various competitions based on the real-time data available on the game. Leagues often also sign direct contracts with media companies. They are trying to expand the content they offer the media even more in the hopes of getting better contracts – one way of hooking them in would be to provide real-time data on the games that the media channels would be delighted to use in their broadcasts. Individual teams can also use the data to support their coaching as the precise data from the game is suitable for developing both the players and coaches. “Betting companies are also a key client group for us due to the growing popularity of in-game betting. Today, if a player is given a yellow card it is possible to immediately bet whether they will receive another card during the game or you can wager which team is going to make the next goal. The vast amount of data that can be gained through our technology increases the number of in-game betting opportunities many times over,” says Kuro. “Many attempts have been made at digitally tracking sports, but I haven’t come across technology like ours anywhere. Our technology is exceptional as it provides real-time data without the need to install active sensors in the players’ equipment,” Kuro says. Aiscreen has received a great deal of interest. The international ice hockey development centre in Vierumäki is the company’s first paying customer. Negotiations are ongoing continually with various Finnish and foreign teams. “We do not know yet whether our next client will be in Finland or abroad. It would be nice to get in on the domestic markets but it isn’t necessary as we are heading abroad in any case. Some international betting companies have shown an interest, as have international ice hockey teams – to such a degree that negotiations with them are clearly worth continuing. It will be interesting to see who’s first,” says Kuro."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/americans-drink-health-finnish-gluten-free-beer/,Americans drink to their health with Finnish ‘gluten-free’ beer,"Finnish gluten-free Kukko (“rooster”) beer is set to be exported to the US after local brewer Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas signed a contract with Good Life Imports, a company specialising in bringing European products to the US. The idea for the partnership first came to  ‘   and   when they worked together at Nokia’s R&D centre in San Diego. “Jason’s a coeliac and he had run into Kukko beers while travelling to Finland,” Mäkinen recalls. “Whenever someone went to Finland, we had to bring Kukko beer back to San Diego for him. There are now some gluten-free beers out there but none of them taste as good as Kukko.” The duo are in the process of finalising US paperwork that will see the first shipment of beer being sent at the end of the year. The drink will be available on shelves in Texas and California in early 2016. One challenge the duo has faced is that while Kukko beer is considered gluten-free by European standards, FDA regulations Stateside have taken a low-risk approach in regards to such labelling. “In Europe you can call a product gluten-free if it’s below 20 parts per million in terms of gluten content,” Mäkinen explains. “That is pretty much the case in Australia and in many parts of the world. In the US, the FDA took a long time deciding what you can call gluten-free and what you cannot.” Thus Kukko beer will be identified as ‘crafted to reduce gluten’ when it is sold in the States. Distinguishing it from similar products on the market, Kukko is devoid of the chemicals typically used to reduce gluten levels during the brewing process, and is made completely from malted barley. Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas created a gluten-free beer by accident. “  actually didn’t set out to brew a gluten-free beer, they set out to brew a great-tasting beer,” Mäkinen exclaims. “They found this out from a study that was done by the Finnish Coeliac Association together with Alko [the government-run alcohol retail monopoly in Finland], where they tested gluten levels of different beers. In that study they found out that the Kukko beers were very low in gluten content.” The beer was thus awarded the Finnish Coeliac Society’s seal of approval, a European standard which will be retained when it reaches the States. Mäkinen believes they are entering the US market at a perfect time, with awareness of gluten-free products growing rapidly. “Roughly one per cent of the population has coeliac disease, and around eight per cent of US households buy gluten-free products, because someone in the household or immediate family has coeliac disease,” he explains. “There are reports of up to 30 per cent of consumers in the US right now who are looking for gluten-free products as it is also a little bit of a health trend.” Nonetheless, Mäkinen is keen to emphasise Kukko’s flavour first. “Our intention is not to advertise it as a gluten-free beer, but as a great-tasting beer that happens to be gluten-free.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/star-tap-accelerates-corporations-and-startups/,Star-tap accelerates corporations and startups,"Everybody likes to talk about startups, but what about the companies supporting them. The latest Finnish accelerator programme taps into collaboration between industry giants and agile startups.  When we talk with  , partner at Finnish accelerator and seed investor  , he is having a good day. A startup he used to chair, cloud-TV platform developer Booxmedia, has just been sold to the UK for 7.9 million euros. Booxmedia serves as a perfect example of what Koppicatch aims to do with its new Star-tap accelerator programme: facilitate cooperation between big corporations and startups. “Booxmedia’s major customer is [Finnish telecommunications group] Dna, who also invested in the company three years ago,” Hagros explains. “Dna got an excellent online-TV service and in exchange their collaboration helped to advance Booxmedia on international markets and get the attention of a stock listed technology company – who now acquired them.” Although Star-tap isn’t targeting investments, at least not directly, it is exactly this kind of commercial collaboration (product development, reselling or outsourcing) the six-month programme wants to launch. Corporations gain from having access to potentially disruptive ideas and fast startup processes, while startups get to develop products together with their customer and open potential growth channels. While the collaboration idea isn’t new, on the contrary the trend has been growing as corporations are looking for ways to reform their industries, Koppicatch has taken a fresh approach to it: “Traditionally international corporations have had their own venturing or M&A [merger and acquisition] departments, which can be expensive and heavy for organisations to run,” Hagros says. “Here the aim is to offer an extremely easy and effortless way to ignite cooperation between big companies and startups and to find potential collaborative projects.” The first round of Star-tap focuses on digital service innovations and has attracted Dna, together with Finnish media group Alma Media, as its first corporation partners. Currently both companies are going through a short list of potential startup partners, based on suggestions by Koppicatch. While Start-tap is the latest addition to Koppicatch’s offering, the company has built a solid reputation as part of successful Finnish accelerator programme ‘ ’. Launched in 2009 by the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy (TEM), the aim of Vigo is to create new growth companies in Finland, attract international venture funding and offer startups a ‘one-stop shop’ access to public funding instruments. “What young startups want from accelerators is ideas, contacts, business advice and best practices so they don’t need to repeat the same mistakes other startups have done. Often they are also looking for some kind of funding, directly or indirectly,” says Kaj Hagros. The programme currently comprises of 10 certified accelerators and around 100 portfolio companies. “The central idea of Vigo is to be a two year intensive coaching programme, which focuses on building mental capital, between selected startups and certified accelerators,” explains  , programme coordinator. “That period also includes roughly one–two million in seed funding from a mix of private and public sources.” Part of that money comes from the accelerators themselves.  , industrial counsellor at TEM, emphasises this is rare internationally and also gives accelerators extra motivation to help their startups succeed. “In Finland accelerator programmes are more intensive and they have a considerably stronger role than elsewhere. Accelerators have an integral role in helping to form a strategy for a startup and executing it,” Valtonen says. While the Vigo model is unique, it has been influenced by two other countries: Israel and the US. In the US accelerator programmes are often short and focus on business development and private funding. By contrast, the accelerator model in Israel has been driven by government support. The model is based on a long term approach where the acceleration period is two to three years and typically 85 per cent of seed funding comes from the government. Vigo has successfully combined elements from both models and the results have been impressive, even on a global scale. To date the programme has acquired more than 350 million euros in funding, mostly from foreign private investors, for its portfolio companies. The number also includes around 80 million euros of public equity. Consequently, Vigo has attracted Europe-wide interest. According to Ruotsalainen several countries have said they are planning to implement a similar model. But the Finnish ecosystem isn’t limited to Vigo. There are around 10 other accelerators, among them the internationally renowned Startup Sauna. It is a non-profit organisation whose bi-annual, five-week programme this spring attracted 545 applications from startups all over the world. Its alumni companies have raised over 42 million US dollars in funding. Time will tell whether the future of Star-tap will be as bright. It has attracted plenty of interest and, if everything goes well, the next step is opening the programme to startups outside Finland, as Koppicatch already receives plenty of enquiries from abroad. “Startups want support, sparring and coaching and believe it leads to faster results,” Hagros concludes. “Helsinki today is a significant and acknowledged startup hub which can be compared to Berlin, Israel and even Silicon Valley.” The Finnish accelerator ecosystem has successfully combined elements from the accelerator models in Israel and the US."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/readerstage-ticks-a-box-on-your-bucket-list/,Readerstage ticks a box on your bucket list,"Similarly to a trip around the world, writing a book is a common thing on people’s bucket lists. With the help of Readerstage anyone can publish their debut novel. The service also provides both writers and readers a social space for sharing tips, advice, and conversations. A bucket list refers to a set of things one wants to accomplish before kicking, well, the bucket (the English language is creative like that).   CEO   knows that writing a book is high up on the list for a lot of people. ”Every time there’s a survey conducted regarding people’s biggest dreams, writing a book comes up,” he says. Readerstage, born in 2013, gives everyone the opportunity to share the book they’ve kept in their drawer. Initially the company was founded in order to create an e-reader device for digital books, but then tablets appeared, with which only Kindle has been able to compete. Hence, Patronen says, Readerstage started looking at digital music services, such as Soundcloud. ”There are multiple music-related services that combine self-published material, social community, and mainstream stuff. We found that in terms of literature none of this is available.” However, the Readerstage team doesn’t consist of book geeks, rather technology and digital experts. The book market attracted them, because its digitalisation is lagging behind the pace of the music industry despite the vast and global already existing market. Readerstage doesn’t leave its readers alone. In addition to the self-publication system and the edited catalogue, the service comes with a social community through which users can follow each other and get suggestions and recommendations from real people, not algorithm-based machines. ”There are multiple music-related services that combine self-published material, social community, and mainstream stuff. We found that in terms of literature none of this is available,” says Readerstage CEO Markku Patronen. According to Patronen, choosing what to read from thousands or millions of different alternatives can be a difficult and heavy chore. ”Users can decide whom they follow. The service offers suggestions made by the computer, but tips coming from real people are always the most relevant ones,” he says. So far the majority of the books are in Finnish. The selection will be expanded substantially as soon as publishers from abroad jump on the wagon. The system used for self-publishing is, as Patronen puts it, made as easy as possible. The user uploads the document onto the service, writes a description, and gives it a price tag. The price can be changed at any point. Then he or she clicks ‘save’ and waits. ”Before publishing we go through the book to ensure it’s readable and not just straight from an online translator. This takes two to three working days, and after that the book will be published, provided that it’s written in sensible language and doesn’t break any laws.” Readerstage wants to be involved in the big change of the book market. Patronen describes how the company has a long-term vision and a view of the world from which the whole service has been built into existence. ”If publishing books was invented now, things would go very differently. Now publishers go through a huge amount of scripts, and sometimes it can take a year before the author hears back from them. The process takes a long time.” Patronen emphasises that Readerstage is anything but negative in its attitude towards publishers; instead he appreciates their expertise. Even so, digitalisation has changed the whole industry so much that the majority of items don’t sell out their first edition. ”Then books end up in clearance sale baskets and then they’re burned. That makes no sense.” Patronen deems digital platforms the most sensible way of publishing. Although bestsellers should still be printed, digital tools increase the effectiveness of publishing. They give a chance to test the waters and get more books out into the market. The need for professional help doesn’t disappear, especially when we’re talking about people who publish their writing for the first time. Readerstage is looking into collaborating with companies that offers services similar to publishers: they help authors polish up the final product. Readerstage offers a platform for all books regardless of the language. The standard language for the service is English, and the first country-specific language is Finnish. More language versions will be published when the service is launched in new areas. The first place in sight is Europe. ”For example, in Britain e-books have established themselves in the market, so there’s a lot more competition and similar companies. Then there are countries like Finland that haven’t quite caught up. Differences between countries can be immense,” Patronen points out. Readerstage offers a platform for all books regardless of the language."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-taipale-brothers-take-their-best-shot/,The Taipale Brothers take their best shot,"This fraternal photographic duo from Tampere is making a significant impact in the world of Instagram. As their number of followers continues to rise, so too does the client list of their brand ambassador service. Given their reputation as adventurers, explorers and capturers of memorable moments, it comes as no surprise that when Skype connects through to  , they have just pulled their car over to the side of the road to take the call. However, rather than scaling the heights of Norwegian peaks, touring between European cities in a VW Kombi van or basking in the beauty of Hawaii, this trip sees the brothers heading to the Finnish city of Turku to shoot a wedding. “We still do other stuff than Instagram campaigns,” Daniel admits with a laugh. Together the two brothers have forged a name for themselves in recent years as successful brand ambassadors, creating various promotional campaigns for companies such as BMW Finland, Hilton Hotels, Red Bull, Vodafone Australia, Vitamin Water and Visit Finland. The key to their success has been a successful marriage between each brand identity and the duo’s own lifestyle, one that sees them basking in some of the most remarkable landscapes in the world. “Our thing has always been living the brand and telling that story with the brand,” Daniel explains. “The companies that we like, we would use anyway; a company with super good hiking, travelling gear, for example. It’s a good way for us to connect with them.” Back when the duo first joined Instagram in 2010, intertwining business and pleasure wasn’t on their radar at all. After Samuel set off on a trip around the USA, he posted pictures of his exploits to the fledging photo sharing service, so his friends and family back home could see what he was up to. Another hard day ‘at the office’. Samuel is the showman and spokesman of the duo. “It started from fun,” he recalls. “When people really started liking our pictures, we realised it’s possible for us to have a little bit more likes. When likes turned into followers we then had a game between the two of us who is going to have more followers.” Now, with a collective total of around 230 000 people following their every moves around the globe, the biggest winners were undoubtedly the duo themselves. Needless to say it didn’t take long for companies to sit up and take notice. “Our strong side has been we’ve always wanted to create some story for a company where they fit,” Daniel states, emphasising the consideration taken before accepting each project. “We’ve had to say no to many companies. It would be quick money, but in the long run it doesn’t look good. It’s not always an easy thing to say no, but we believe so strongly in the stories we can create behind our photos.” Although Samuel is now based in Oslo, their company remains registered in Finland. It’s brotherly business as usual: Daniel still takes care of the project planning, design and paperwork, leaving Samuel with his shock of curly blonde hair to act as showman and spokesman. Furthermore, given the nature of their work, the number of assignments abroad hasn’t drastically altered the amount of time they spend together. In fact, the future may see them tackling longer-term projects, all in keeping with their philosophy of exploration. “We are adventurers 24/7,” Daniel explains. Even after a long day ‘at the office’, their inquisitive nature is unabated. “If we are all done [with a project], then we go all in for fun.” “Our thing has always been living the brand and telling that story with the brand,” Daniel Taipale explains. The brothers have forged a name for themselves in recent years as successful brand ambassadors, creating promotional campaigns for companies such as BMW Finland, Hilton Hotels, Red Bull and Vodafone Australia."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/klaus-haro-finds-communal-strength-in-finnish-films/,Klaus Härö finds communal strength in Finnish films,"For this acclaimed director, the art of collaboration is an important stepping-stone towards wider success for the local industry. Growing up as an only child in the small town of Porvoo, some 50 kilometres from Helsinki,   was obsessed with movies. While his friends enjoyed watching films on home video, young Härö could often be found at the local cinema, his father unconvinced by the merits of VHS technology. “Seeing a film for me was in itself an enterprise,” he recalls. “I would read about a film and I would want to see it, but it would usually take a year or two before I would be sitting in a cinema experiencing it, so it was very good training for me. It really felt like a reward. This is very close to what I am doing today as a filmmaker.” For each of his five feature films to date, Härö has drawn on the admiration of Scandinavian directors he cultivated during those many hours alone staring in wonderment at the silver screen. In fact, such is his reverence of their arthouse sensibilities that he made his first three features in Sweden. For him, cinema was alive in Finland’s neighbouring countries to the west. But the south? That was uncharted territory. “I never would have imagined finding myself in Estonia making a film,” Härö states. Having previously never set foot in the country, this attitude abruptly changed a few years ago when he was handed the script of  . Some 15 pages in to the tale of a young Estonian fencer who flees to his homeland in the 1950s, with the Russian secret police in pursuit, “I thought this story is so brilliant, so cinematic. I’d love to do it.” Many have agreed. His beautifully shot film has been very well received in Finland and Estonia, with murmurs of Oscar talk coinciding with a growing number of glowing reviews. The word has begun spreading abroad:   described   as a “well-acted, smoothly crafted drama” and the film was bestowed with the Bernhard Wicki Award at the Munich International Film Festival in July. Klaus Härö accepted the Bernard Wicki Award for The Fencer in July. However, rather than bask solo in the spotlight amidst such enthusiastic accolades, Härö is adamant that he share it with his co-workers. “This was perhaps the biggest thing for me to learn as a filmmaker,” the only child reflects. “Film is really all about working with other people.” Härö emphasises his willingness to consider suggestions from his crew at all stages of the creative process, something that reflects the attitude shared by the filmmaking community as a whole in Finland. It’s not unheard of to find Härö visiting the editing suites of fellow directors such as   and  , offering suggestions to help bring their films to completion. This process is duly reciprocated. “Among Finnish directors there is a feeling of mutual respect,” Härö states. “There is a really big thirst to throw yourself in, make contact and find co-workers and develop as filmmakers.” By embracing this spirit of collaboration, the tight-knit community of the Finnish industry seeks to export local tales to wider international audiences. The goal is to emulate the success enjoyed by smaller countries such as Israel and Romania on the cinematic world stage, with their own particular, peculiar Finnish flavour. “We have this local touch,” he explains. “We have this modesty, downgrading yourself; this oddball humour and pessimism on the surface, but some stubborn optimism – just don’t show it. These are unique features for Finns and they will make for funny and intriguing stories.” Sitting amidst the morning bustle of a downtown Helsinki café, Härö is engaging company, infusing the conversation with dashes of humour and acute self-awareness. All the while his humility remains steadfast, even as his latest sensitive and thought-provoking success continues to stand tall amidst the steady hum of blockbusters assaulting the box office. “I always grew up thinking that if I ever get to make films, probably no one is going to watch them except my mum and dad – and dad’s going to be asleep. I am always surprised and flattered that people have seen my films.” Klaus Härö (front) and the producers of The Fencer, Kaarle Aho and Kai Nordberg."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pure-waste-recycles-waste-into-shirts/,Pure Waste recycles waste into shirts,"Pure Waste makes 100 per cent recycled clothing from textile waste. In a year and a half, the company has saved 200 million litres of freshwater by making products out of recycled cotton. This innovative Finnish company is now building its own recycling plant in India. The clothing industry does not have the best reputation around. The shady side of the clothing industry is a much-discussed topic – terrible quality, deplorable working conditions and factories that are in bad shape. It’s something  , one of  ’s founders, is fully aware of. Pesola travelled to Asia for the first time at the turn of the century to scout out factories for clothing production. The focus of textile production at that point had switched from Europe to Asia. Pesola saw problems with that. According to him, more than 10 to 15 per cent of textiles was going to waste in connection with clothing manufacture.  had encountered the same problem. In 2006 he was involved in establishing a company called Costo that manufactured hats from leftover fabric. “Jukka was Costo’s first customer,” says Bengs. “He thought our business looked promising. He has been a part of our operations ever since.” Currently the company sells the same products at its founding store in Helsinki and on its online store: white, black and grey hoodies and t-shirts for men and women. In 2013, Pesola, Bengs and three other partners set up Pure Waste, a company that makes high-quality fabrics from textile waste. The company’s goal is to make 100 per cent recycled yarn without weakening the quality of the fibres. “When we started out, we decided to do this right and that the fabric had to be 100 per cent recycled. We actually would have had significantly more material options if we had decided to mix new materials in with the recycled,” Pesola recounts. The company has been profitable. According to its own calculations, Pure Waste has saved 200 million litres of freshwater by making products out of recycled cotton. The saved water comes from recycling: farmers require an average of roughly 11 000 litres of water for every kilo of cotton. Savings are also achieved by not dying the fabrics; instead, the textiles are sorted according to colour and quality. To make a black t-shirt, for example, black textile waste is collected and processed into black yarn. Currently the company sells simple pieces of clothing on its online store: white, black and grey hoodies and t-shirts for men and women. When buying a t-shirt, the customer receives a friendly reminder of the amount of water saved: a total of 2 700 litres. Pure Waste hopes to expand in future with the help of co-operation lines. They have received a lot of enquiries from major clothing brands. “Every company wants to operate sustainably. That’s where future markets lie,” Bengs stresses. Although Pure Waste did not invent recycling, the company strives to advance recycling technology and the way textile waste is used. “Recycling is no longer about finding the cheapest possible way to come up with some kind of mess; instead, the focus is on achieving the best possible end result,” says Pesola. Recycling will increase in future also due to a lack of material. Recycling is no longer about finding the cheapest possible way to come up with some kind of mess; instead, the focus is on achieving the best possible end result. “As consumption in the West rises, the world’s most populous countries will develop and their consumption will grow. We will have to be able to grow more food crops and more cotton. The equation just doesn’t add up,” says Pesola. In India, this fact has already been taken into account. The country is trying to recycle everything. For example, more than 95 per cent of paperboard is recycled. In Finland, however, most textile waste ends up at the landfill. “More than 95 per cent of textile fibre can be recycled. So why isn’t it?” asks Bengs. In addition to being ecological, recycled clothing is also more affordable. According to Bengs, it’s 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than clothing made from new materials – provided that production volumes are high enough. The company is in the process of building its own factory in the Coimbatore area of India. The goal is to have their own vertical line up and running within a year, bringing waste in one door and a finished product out the other. Some 80 to 120 employees will be hired locally for the first factory. The total number of employees on the vertical line will eventually rise to 500. According to Bengs and Pesola, the company intends to respect the local laws, but will also pay attention to environmental and ethical values. “We want to offer everything to our employees – from an employment contract to meals at the workplace,” says Pesola. Pure Waste hopes to expand in future with the help of co-operation lines. They have received a lot of enquiries from major clothing brands."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-running-innovation-emphasises-natural-movement/,Finnish running innovation emphasises natural movement,"What do you get when you combine a sports shoe expert and a physiotherapist specialised in lower body problems? Our reporter met with the founders of a new Finnish running shoe company to find out. Enter any sports shop today and you’ll be overwhelmed by choice. There are shelves full of running shoes for overpronators, underpronators, neutral feet, beginners, pros, and the list go on. “I see it as marketing jargon, an easy way to start selling a shoe,” says  , the man behind a new Finnish running shoe called ‘ ’. “Our body is so wise that it naturally fixes movement faults. Even if there can be some structural differences, how the feet function is the same for everybody. It doesn’t need any extra cushioning or support.” Which is why the Helsinki-based company named ‘Feet2’ is not offering tricks, but a running shoe which follows the anatomy of the foot as closely as possible. Suitable for any runner, Feet shoes combine the “natural movement” ideology of barefoot running and the comfort of a shoe. As a keen runner, I had a chance to put this to test. Out of the box, Feet shoes feel light and surprisingly stiff. When first putting them on I was unsure about the fit, but after a few steps the uncertainty was replaced by comfort. Not from cushioning, but the movement feels natural and rolls forward — I almost forgot I am wearing new shoes. We aim to keep the running stride as natural as possible with a shoe, so it mimics the movement of bare feet. “Our passion and interest is the human body. How the foot works is brilliant and its built-in impact reducing mechanism cannot be replaced by any shoe or material,” Niskanen explains. “We aim to keep the running stride as natural as possible with a shoe, so it mimics the movement of bare feet.” The natural feel to Feet comes from its unique construction of intermeshing layers. While many running shoes influence, or even change, the natural sequence of our movement, Feet’s sole design supports it. The Feet running shoe is based on a unique multi-layer structure which allows the shoe to follow the anatomy of the foot. “In cushioned and strongly supported shoes, the small muscles in the feet don’t work efficiently. We don’t use any separate impact softening so the sensory stimulus in the sole happens which activates all the muscles in our feet,” says Niskanen. “A shoe is meant to help a runner move as economically and efficiently as possible.” Niskanen knows what he is talking about. As a physiotherapist he specialises in the lower body and earned his shoe design credentials at Finnish sporting goods company Karhu. Together with mentor  , Niskanen created a line of lightweight running shoes often referred as ‘legendary’: the Karhu M-Series. Launched in early 2000s, the M-Series earned both praise and popularity in international running circles, but its manufacturing was discontinued when Karhu was sold to foreign investors in 2008. But for Feet this was a blessing in disguise. After a few years of breaking the idea down, Niskanen again teamed up with Salminen to design a new kind of running shoe. Their innovative sole construction was granted patentability in 2013 and Feet2, the company, was born. Since its first steps, Feet2 has progressed quickly. While finding a manufacturer for the new shoe construction wasn’t easy, old industry contacts came to the rescue. A factory with the right expertise was found in China and Feet arrived to store shelves in March 2015. It’s no small feat for a startup company to enter a market dominated by global sporting giants, but Niskanen and his business partner   believe their product is unique. “The only way to stand out is to do something original,” says Niskanen. “Our background helps as well, as people are interested in what we do. We haven’t received negative feedback from anyone who has bought the shoe. Everybody notices the difference.” Currently the Feet shoes are only available in Finland and online, but next on the roadmap are global markets starting from German-speaking countries. Consequently the company is working on international patents and a new extra-light Feet racing shoe, based on the same ideology, will hit shelves in the spring. “The signs for the next season and our growth figures are really promising,” Havas says. “It is not an easy market, but persistent work is always rewarded. In a few years we will hopefully be everywhere.” In the race for shelf space, Feet2 believes in the natural power of the feet. The innovative Feet running shoe was created by Teukka Niskanen (pictured) and Matti Salminen, also known as the design duo behind a shoe legend in the running circles, the Karhu M-series."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/4-finnish-health-tech-startups-to-keep-an-eye-on/,4 Finnish healthtech startups to keep an eye on,"Finland’s startup reputation may have been built on mobile games, but that is only one side of the story. Here is our pick of four innovative wellness startups with potential to become the next big Finnish success story — and be good for us. The first startup on our list focuses on a very basic need: a good night’s sleep. Trouble with sleeping? Based on professional equipment, the Beddit Sleep Monitor analyses your sleep and gives advice on how to improve its quality. Helsinki-based  is behind the ‘Beddit Sleep Monitor’ which not only tracks sleep, but proactively gives advice on how to improve its quality. It works using an ultra-thin sensor which you slid under your bedsheet and it pairs with an accompanying mobile app to automatically provide data on heart rate, movement, breathing and even snoring. The full report awaits you in the morning. Demand for the monitor was validated early as the company’s 2013 crowdfunding round flew past 500 000 dollars, received pre-orders from 106 countries and became one of the most successful Finnish crowdfunding projects to date. Beddit’s first sleep monitors arrived on the market a few months later, in January 2014. Since then Beddit has raised a total of eight million dollars in funding, signed a major distribution deal in the US and been named as one the hottest startups in Helsinki by  . The second generation monitor ‘Beddit Smart’ was launched in May and as Beddit plans another major announcement for October, company employees won’t have much chance for napping anytime soon. While quality of sleep is a concern for many so is the quality of ingredients found in our daily cosmetics. The trouble is sometimes it can feel like an Enigma machine is needed to decipher them. CosmEthics’ cosmetics ingredients decoding app has hit the headlines since its launch at the Techcrunch Disrupt startup event in London last October. Luckily   is here to do the decoding. The mobile app, developed by a Finnish startup of the same name, scans the barcodes of cosmetic products and presents an analysis of their ingredients. Any potentially harmful ingredients are flashed with a red or orange label and the app offers suggestions for alternative, safer products. Users can also personalise alerts for any preferences or allergies they have to specific ingredients. Such usefulness has helped to put CosmEthics firmly on the radar for hot new startups. Barely a month after the app was launched at TechCrunch Disrupt event in London last October, the startup was a finalist at Northern Europe’s largest startup event Slush and featured on   as one the hottest lifestyle trends for 2015. And CosmEthics isn’t slowing down. On the roadmap is its launch in China, app for professional users and securing additional investors in a new funding round. Pulse On has launched a wrist-based sports tracker with an unique optical heart rate sensor that offers the same accuracy as traditional straps.  gets our heart rates going and not only because the startup has its roots in famed Finnish technology giant Nokia. Spun off from the telecoms company in 2012, Pulse On was founded to develop the most accurate and reliable optical heart rate monitors possible. This came true late last year as the company launched ‘Pulse On’, a lightweight wrist wearable with a unique optical heart rate sensor. Targeted at sports and fitness enthusiasts, the device measures heart rate by optically detecting variations in blood flow in the wrist. The measurement data automatically syncs with an accompanying mobile app and users receive individualised analytics of their training and easy-to-understand feedback such as training intensity and recovery time. Pulse On claims to offer the best reliability in a variety of conditions, from high endurance sports to rest, and match the accuracy of traditional chest straps. While Pulse On is targeting a highly competitive market, the combination of its patented sensor technology, over two million euros in funding and placement among  European startups suggests the company is in no mood the be intimidated by even its biggest rivals. You-app encourages a healthier lifestyle through daily micro-actions: small tasks that improve both physical and mental wellbeing. If it is good enough for  , it is good enough for us and that secures a place for the last startup on our list, Fifth Corner and its ‘ . The wellness app advocates healthier lives through ‘micro-actions’ instead of constant measuring of fitness. You-app gives users daily micro-actions (varying from eating a healthy snack to walking barefoot) which are completed by taking a picture and sharing it with the app community. The micro-actions are decided by experts and cover food, mindfulness, movement and the things we love. While the approach may sound gentle compared to many fitness programmes, it is supported by science. Many researchers see small steps as the best path to sustainable change. You-app also has a strong and vocal backer in aforementioned celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. He works with Fifth Corner on the app’s content, particularly with regard to food related micro-actions. Fifth Corner has yet to divulge exact numbers, but the company says You-app has gained hundreds of thousands of registered users since its early launch in January and its next version is just around the corner. Furthermore, the startup is about to embark upon a new founding round to build on its initial seed round of 550 000 dollars. Sounds to us You-app is only getting started."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-one-of-a-kind-electric-hyper-car/,Finland’s one of a kind electric hyper car,"From the quiet slow Finnish countryside has come something really loud and fast that will change the hyper car world forever. Not very often do childhood dreams become reality, but the Toroidion 1MW electric hyper car is exactly this, a lifelong vision of  , designer and CEO of  . Raised watching rally car racing in the ’70s, Pennanen always thought these cars were somewhat bland. Then at age eight he saw the film   about a 24-hour endurance car race in France, and a spark lit inside him. The danger, the speed, and the technological levels of it all brought him a vision, that he would one day design a car that wins at Le Mans. The Toroidion 1MW concept car from Toroidion Ltd. was unveiled in April by  at the Top Marques car show in Monaco. It is completely electric holding a 1 341 horse power engine with four direct drive motors, reaching speeds of up to 400 kilometres per hour in just 11 seconds. And it’s powered by a battery that lasts roughly 500 kilometres and can be changed without coming to a complete stop. It’s a lifestyle product. Today people are willing to pay more to carry the responsibility to be green. “We call it ‘Toro’ because it’s like a raging bull,” Pennanen claims. “People talk about horse power, but with an electric car you should call it bull power.” Displaying a retro design with gull wing doors and fenders along with conventional trunk luggage space, Toro is not only a race car, but a street legal weekend getaway car. And while typical super cars are very high maintenance and spend much of their time waiting to be serviced, this car is designed to need only limited servicing. The company also plans to have a team of engineers out visiting the cars on customer premises to ensure they are running smoothly and always available for customer use. “A car cannot just sit in a garage or in a collection, then it’s like a caged animal,” states Pennanen. “It should be driven.” For the production version of the car, Toroidion Ltd. has developed what they call ‘powertrain technology’. This is a cutting edge, highly efficient method of transferring electricity from battery to motor that is also scalable for many applications such as motorcycles, boats, and even aeroplanes. The luxury hyper car market is consistently present, but volatile like any other. According to Pennanen, the coming and going tensions around the world may cause swings in the market, but there will always be plenty of wealthy people excited about these high end sports cars. Also with increasing concerns about global warming, electric cars in general are becoming more attractive to the consumer. The Toroidian uses all green technology run on a battery that is easily rechargeable with any average power outlet. “It’s a lifestyle product. Today people are willing to pay more to carry the responsibility to be green,” reflects Pennanen. “It’s nice to escape to the countryside knowing you don’t need to go to the petrol station.” Up to date, Toroidion Ltd. has been a family business personally financed by about 20 board members with the help of Tekes, the Finnish funding agency for technology. The future plans are licencing out the new ‘powertrain technology’ and mass producing the Toroidion 1MW, and even making a four-seater or perhaps a motorcycle. “The direction of the company is quite flexible at the moment,” says Pennanen. But for now remains the most important goal, running Toro to victory at the 24-hour Le Mans race. Better than a Batmobile: The Toroidion 1MW concept car was unveiled in April by Prince Albert II at the Top Marques car show in Monaco."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/neonto-studio-s-success-is-all-in-the-application/,Neonto Studio’s success is all in the application,"Untangling the restrictions of coding frees up app designers to focus on their creativity. What is your favourite app? Maybe it’s a word game you flick through whilst waiting for the bus. Perhaps it’s a news app, siphoning the latest headlines from around the world into the palm of your hand. Regardless of its content, every app shares something in common behind the scenes: code. Line upon line of indecipherable text to the untrained eye ties everything together to produce a seemingly effortless user experience. So, with this in mind, say you have a great idea for an app. How can you bring it to fruition? “There are quite a few tools around for making mobile apps, but usually you have to be a programmer and know how to write code, or they are really simple, template-style tools where you can put in some images,” explains   CEO . “With these the feel of the userface is different and slower than a real app. We make a tool for designers to create mobile apps for phones and tablets easily and quickly.” Pauli Ojala drew on almost three decades of coding experience when he set about creating the Neonto tool in 2009. Utilising an interface similar to Photoshop, the tool renders irrelevant the time intensive creative process of ping-ponging emails between graphic designers, programmers and clients. Here code is automatically created, leaving designers to simply get on with doing as their job title suggests. The idea first surfaced in 2009 while Ojala was toiling away on a number of mobile app projects. Wondering how he could streamline the app making process without compromising on quality, he set to work, drawing on his almost three decades of coding experience. Receiving a boost in capital from Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation), the fruits of his labour emerged a year-and-a-half ago. This was followed by an Invesdor crowdfunding round last December, which saw Neonto achieve wider publicity. “We wanted to get the word out and attract people who wanted to work with us,” Ojala recalls. “With Invesdor if people like what we are doing then they actually get a share of the company. That’s the ultimate way to give something back to people who want to give something.”  then joined Ojala onboard as the company’s CMO, as the final tweaks were made to the beta version. Now, with Version 1.0 about to drop, Neonto is contemplating various avenues for monetisation, including the possibility of introducing a licence fee. A variety of users have already been attracted to Neonto’s tool, including Helsinki street festival Kallio Kukkii and the Finnish National Theatre. “We are really different than the competition,” CMO Antti Sihlman explains. “Because our tool produces native code you can add things like Apple Watch and Internet of Things software to your app.” “The theatre made an app that will change for every play that’s being staged,” Ojala states, demonstrating its novel photo-capturing capabilities by ‘placing’ an animated moustache upon the onscreen image of Sihlman, who is seated next to him. “It is possible to take these big ideas to completion pretty easily.” Sihlman then sets about demonstrating this ease by creating a camera app from scratch in ten minutes. “We are really different than the competition,” he explains, whilst busying himself on his laptop. “Because our tool produces native code you can add things like Apple Watch and Internet of Things software to your app.” With that, the fully functioning app is completed. A quick transfer to his phone and Sihlman begins snapping away. “Our business idea is to change the world as to how apps are developed,” he states. An app that is ready for use in only ten minutes – Neonto is certainly well down the path towards achieving their goal."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/iron-danger-will-rise/,Iron Danger will rise,"Finland’s national epic, Kalevala, is experiencing a 21st century facelift. With this in mind, keep an eye out for the tank-bears next time you are out gallivanting about the countryside. “We want to tell Finnish stories and make Finnish culture known around the world,” enthuses Sami Timonen. Numerous notable students have walked the esteemed grounds of Oxford University, yet how many do we know have had trouble returning their library books in a timely fashion? Well, count one   among them, who accumulated a fine in 1912 that was believed to be for a copy of  .

Well, it turns out that Tolkien was so inspired by     that he eventually used Finnish as the basis for Middle Earth’s fictional language of Elvish.  is undoubtedly the most revered of Finnish texts. Comprised of a collection of mythical poems originally passed from person to person, the national epic is now set for an update for the Millennial Generation. “We want to tell Finnish stories and make Finnish culture known around the world,” enthuses  , director of the new multi-media project,  . “But, we have to reach them in a way that the modern audience can grasp.” For Timonen, this means that  ’s main character Väinämöinen is now a ripped, muscle-bound hero. Armed with a hoe, he faces off against mechanical ‘tank-bears’ ridden by the gatekeeper of a northern fortress that houses a precious magical artefact. “The vision that Sami had was so bold and outrageous,” says producer  . “I really like that he took this really cherished cultural heritage that we possess in Finland and then re-imagined it as a modern  -thing.” The idea first came to Timonen five years ago. After much tinkering with the concept, he asked his colleagues at  games studio Rovio if they would be interested in helping him realise his vision. Before long he had amassed over 150 employees from Rovio, Supercell and numerous other Finnish companies, who each volunteered their spare time to create a proof of concept trailer. We are not only making a movie, it is a whole world. Now, after the fruits of their labour left audiences stunned at last year’s startup event Slush, the team is busy gathering financing in order to develop the project even further than they first imagined. “We are not only making a movie, it is a whole world,” explains Klemetti. “We are making games – obviously Helsinki is now a hotbed of the gaming industry – then we want to expand the whole idea: books comics and number of different movies or TV shows.” But amidst this flurry of activity are there any reservations about rebooting such sacred text for a modern audience? “We feel we are part of the folklore, we are the new storytellers,” Klemetti continues. “It’s the time of mobile games, we don’t have to tell this in a book form; we are telling it in a new way. According to Klemetti the response to the project thus far has been overwhelmingly positive, with audiences enthusiastic that the world so vividly presented by Lönnrot is being brought to life for new audiences. With Finland’s 100th anniversary of independence beckoning in 2017, the first  project to arrive on shelves is shaping up to be a game. With his dream so tantalisingly close to becoming a reality, Timonen is brimming with enthusiasm to share his vision with the world. “Hopefully this story pumps the younger audience up about Finnish culture. It would be fantastic.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ditch-your-plastic-intellipocket-brings-loyalty-cards-to-your-phone/,"Ditch your plastic, Intellipocket brings loyalty cards to your phone","It is time to say goodbye to plastic cards. Finnish software developer Intellipocket helps companies of all sizes to create mobile loyalty programmes. A wallet overflowing with loyalty cards is a frustrating sight to many. It is also what sparked the idea for  Intellipocket, a Helsinki-based company digitising loyalty, licence and membership cards. And the company hasn’t stopped at replacing plastic cards with mobile ones, but creates full-scale branded mobile applications to boost loyalty, sales and customer engagement. “Plastic isn’t a two-way communication channel. With our mobile apps a company can do polls, send vouchers, share news and integrate it with marketing automation and other services, such as a members’ extranet,” says  , CEO of  . “Where a plastic card is only a means of identification, a mobile app can offer better customer and member service.” So how does it work? For large organisations Intellipocket creates tailored mobile apps which integrate with existing customer and marketing systems. Cloud-based web management tools enable easy content creation and distribution and everything in the app is personalised for the organisation’s brand. But Intellipocket hasn’t forgotten entrepreneurs and smaller companies. Last year it released ‘Intellipocket Studio’, an online self-service tool where any company (no matter their size or whether they have an existing loyalty programme) can create their own branded mobile loyalty application. “In essence both are the same product, but with Studio you can create your own application through our website which is cheaper than a tailored project with custom integrations,” explains Grannenfelt. “Around 98 per cent of European companies are SMEs… with Studio they can build a light and agile loyalty programme and marketing channel.” It appears to be working. More than two million Intellipoint created apps have now been downloaded and this spring the company was included on technology magazine Red Herring’s Top 100 most innovative technology companies in Europe. Of course popularity also means ubiquity and for Intellipocket, founded in 2009, that means getting its loyalty apps onto any phone, no matter how smart. The result: Intellipocket’s own private app store. “When a person wants the app [after exploring a company’s website, email or social media], it is sent to them on a text message in a personalised link. When they click the link, the app store identifies their operating system and phone model and automatically creates a personalised application which is suitable for their device,” Grannenfelt explains. The market for mobile loyalty card has grown tremendously, but ongoing commitment to physical cards remains their greatest obstacle. “Companies can also send invitation text messages to large groups of people, like existing member and customer registers,” he adds. As all individual applications are created for the specific user, companies don’t have to worry over their app’s compatibility (or the costs that come with it) with different phone models. Intellipocket claims its mobile apps work with 95 per cent of mobile phones in Europe — even that six year old Nokia in your drawer. Furthermore companies retain a full control over their apps as there is no need for app store intermediaries such as Google Play and Apple Store. Now armed with Studio, Intellipocket and its eight employees have seen demand grow across the Nordics and are ready to expand: “The EU is our main market for the next year, but we have already tested our technology in Northern America and Africa and done pilots in Singapore and Asia. There are no technological obstacles to our internationalisation,” says Grannenfelt. And Intellipocket’s grand plans have already received a major boost. It recently signed a certification deal with retail and hospitality software giant Oracle Hospitality. As its certified partner, Intellipocket has potential access to Oracle’s circa 300,000 customers. The cooperation has already been tested out in building a mobile loyalty solution for the Finnish nation-wide coffee shop chain Picnic. These are huge steps for a company which already has a bedrock of 80 customers in its Finland home market. “This is a natural way to scale our business on the enterprise side. We aren’t telling ourselves that a startup of this size can alone sell to Tesco or H&M globally, but the partnership strategy is proving to be successful,” says Grannfelt. “This supports our internationalisation on the enterprise side and Studio and SME users on the other side.” It seems loyalty works both ways. Intellipocket offers a way to create full-scale mobile loyalty applications personalised for company brands."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/puzzlephone-users-repair-their-own-phones/,Puzzlephone users repair their own phones,"After working in Spain for 15 years in a number of technology companies, Alejandro Santacreu wished to create something new. Before that could happen, however, he had to move to Finland. What resulted is the Puzzlephone, Finland’s, and possibly the world’s, first modular phone. “I noticed something when taking the bus,” says Santacreu. “Many people had broken screens on their phones. When I asked them why they didn’t do something about it, the answer I got was always: ‘I don’t have time to take my phone to be repaired.” His simple solution? Repair your phone’s screen yourself. The  , consisting of modular, or detachable, parts is the first product created by Santacreu’s company Circular Devices. It is not yet available in stores but the company is planning to have the smart phone on the markets by the end of the year. In addition to the screen, also the battery and the central processing unit (CPU) can be detached. This makes it possible to repair a broken part, such as a screen, yourself – buy a new screen, replace the old broken one with it and voila! Your phone is fixed. “You don’t need to buy a new phone, just a new part,” says Santacreu. Similarly, the phone can be upgraded to a new version, simply by exchanging the CPU for an updated one. This extends the lifecycle of the phone and reduces electronics waste. “If your old CPU is too slow for you, you can give it to your grandparents, for example,” Santacreu says. The company, established in 2013, was launched in Finland but Santacreu is from the village of Saint Juan in Alicante, Spain. How did a Spanish engineer end up in Helsinki, 4000 kilometres from his home village? In March 2015, Puzzlephone announced a new partnership: the Spanish company Imas D will be responsible for the phone’s technology. To the left in the photo Pedro David Pelaez from Imas D and to the right Alejandro Santacreu. “When people ask me how I ended up in Finland, I tell them that my GPS broke down,” he says with a laugh. “My wife and I spent a lot of time deliberating where we would like to move. Our list included the Nordics, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.” The couple eventually decided on Finland because it is an EU country and, according to Santacreu, has the best expertise: “Thanks to Nokia you have a lot of competence in technology.” Santacreu, a self-professed nerd, worked for various companies in Spain for over 15 years, during which time he ran into a number of problems that he became determined to fix. Before he could do this, however, he had to establish a company and assemble the right group of people around it. The result was Circular Devices, which became domiciled in Helsinki and launched its first product – the Puzzlephone. The Puzzlephone is backed by a complete ideology. “The transfer of all production to Asia means that people are in a situation where they are not aware of how devices work. And when you don’t know how something works, you don’t know how to fix it either,” Santacreu says. “Copied credit cards, information leaks, you name it,” Santacreu says. His goal is to bring production back to Europe. Designed in Finland, manufactured in Europe. That is Puzzlephone’s ideology in a nutshell. “Apple is a good example: the company has slowly begun to build a product chain that is not entirely dependent on Asia,” Santacreu says. Puzzlephone is by no means the only modular phone being developed. The best-known modular phone is currently Google’s Project Ara, which consists of several modules, around eight according to the latest estimates. The characteristics of Google’s phone have been divided up into smaller parts. The phone’s memory, for example, is stored in a separate detachable module. According to Santacreu, Ara is too complex. In his opinion people are interested in the simpler aspects of their phones, such as longer-lasting batteries. Puzzlephone has received praise for its simplicity and the company is backed by a number of high-profile supporters. One of the company’s finest moments took place when Europe’s largest technical research organisation, the Fraunhofer institute, decided to support the phone. Another similar moment was when Tapani Jokinen, the designer of Nokia’s 3310 and 1100 phones, became a partner. “It made us feel certain we were on the right track.” In March, Santacreu announced a new partnership at the Mobile World Congress: the Spanish company Imas D will be responsible for the phone’s technology. The phone will utilise Click ARM technology, which is compatible with, for example, tablets utilising the same technology. At the moment, Puzzlephone is waiting for the next step – the first prototype. At least based on the photos, the device bears a slight resemblance to Nokia phones, which is not really a surprise: “It is inspired by Finnish design,” Santacreu reveals. CEO Alejandro Santacreu presenting the Puzzlephone at the Mobile World Congress in early 2015."

They expect their technology will be in tens of millions of vehicles. Old automotive dashboards had an air of uncertainty about them. Children would guess top speeds based upon the highest number printed on the speedometer. A rite of passage for new car owners was to figure out how far into the “E” the needle on the fuel gauge could go before the tank was actually empty. Nowadays instrument panels are much more precise and informative, and one Finnish company is driving the innovation.  was founded in early 2010 to create user interface technology for the automotive industry. They recorded over one million euros in sales their first year and have been growing strongly ever since. “After several years of approximately 50 per cent annual growth in net sales we expect about 100 per cent growth this year,” says CEO  . “We have recently exceeded 20 million cars in our consolidated production forecasts so the technology adoption is definitely spreading fast.” “In Finland we have a long history of graphics engineering with a large competence base. This can be seen in the gaming industry but also in engineering solutions such as ours,” says Jonas Geust, CEO of Rightware. Rightware’s main product Kanzi enables the creation and implementation of human-machine interfaces (HMI). This includes the traditional instrument cluster of car dashboards – like speedometer, tachometer and warning lights – as well as in-vehicle infotainment. “Our technology was first adopted by the European premium car manufacturers such as Audi. Now Kanzi is used in the Audi TT, A3, Q7, A6 and R8,” Geust says. “In addition to this there are more than ten original equipment manufacturers taking Kanzi into production cars that will be launched within the next six to eighteen months.” He cites the technical performance of their graphics engine as being extremely good, claiming that they can squeeze the most out of any hardware platform. To stand out in the competitive industry Geust says that they need to be fast so their customers can get to market quickly. They must also be adaptable so Kanzi can integrate with the car’s software architecture and be reused among different car models. Rightware has offices in the world’s automotive and technology hotspots, such as Silicon Valley, Detroit, Munich, Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai – but Geust is pleased with their home in Espoo. “In Finland we have a long history of graphics engineering with a large competence base. This can be seen in the gaming industry but also in engineering solutions such as ours,” he says. “Also, the close relationship with design schools and technical universities is an important asset.” Getting the right partners is essential for almost any business. Rightware has recently announced the Kanzi Partner Program to create an ecosystem behind the software. “Partnerships are crucial for us to extend the developer base,” Geust explains. “The goal of the program is to provide customers and partners with resources and a knowledge base for creating real-time rendered digital automotive HMIs with Kanzi.” The company plans to broaden their offering in the coming months. They recently released a new product which tests and measures the performance of their clients’ automotive software and hardware platforms. “At the end of the day it is all about getting fantastic and easy-to-use HMIs in the hands of consumers,” Geust concludes. Rightware’s main product Kanzi enables the creation and implementation of human-machine interfaces (HMI)."

Broad strokes of pink fill the screen amidst abstract splashes of lavender. Whilst the image is undoubtedly mesmerising, its artistic message is more difficult to grasp. Perhaps its meaning is clearer when seen through a creative lens. To the scientific eye though, this is clearly something else: a digitalised slide of a kidney. Thanks to   the argument that science is an art is more difficult to disprove than ever before. The company’s WebMicroscope software modernises the world of microscopy, utilising cloud storage to host digital slide images. This groundbreaking idea of making microscopic images more easily accessible and shareable has deeper roots, however. “We are commercialising a product that began development almost 10 years ago at the University of Helsinki,” explains Fimmic’s CEO  . “During a research project led by Johan and Mikael Lundin, they would often work with these huge microscope images that were unmanageable with regular desktop computers.” Quickly realising the ease and potential of storing such bulky files online, ensuing years saw them developing software that would utilise a Web-based platform. In 2013 the global market was ready and they, together with  , all working at Finnish Institute for Molecular Medicine (FIMM), founded a spin-off company: Fimmic. Their timing was perfect: digital pathology is currently a 2.2 billion-US dollar industry, and this figure is set to double by 2019. During the digital scanning process each individual microscope specimen is scaled down and separated into smaller sections, which are photographed. These thousands of images are then pieced together in real time to a large picture montage. Similar to Google Maps, WebMicroscope saves these on a high-performance image server, enabling viewing through a web interface with any browser and display. The Fimmic team (left to right): Johan Lundin, CSO, founder; Kari Pitkänen, Director, Business Development, founder; Mikael Jääskeläinen, Sales Manager; Mikael Lundin, CTO, founder; Kaisa Helminen, CEO. The company’s rise has been rapid: currently all medical universities in Finland have departments that use WebMicroscope in education. Fimmic is also cultivating growing customer bases within the research, drug discovery and clinical fields in Western Europe and North America. They don’t plan to stop there. Given the ease facilitated by the remote installation of the software, the company has the globe in their sights. The rapidly developing market for digital microscopy is already seeing additional features beyond storage, sharing and visual analysis being added to the software. In light of the declining number of medical students specialising in pathology and the increasing prevalence of diseases such as cancer, fresh digital solutions are a necessity. “We’re bringing in automation,” Helminen explains. “It’s really exciting. It is quantitative automated analysis of the images, so software can identify how many cancer cells or infected cells are in a sample.” She demonstrates with a tap of the screen. The image is flooded with red blood cells, some tinged with dark ink identifying the presence of malaria. A second tap and these tainted cells are quickly gathered together for convenient analysis. “This is an example of a powerful image analysis algorithm created at FIMM, our close collaboration partner,” Helminen explains. While some in the field of microscopy lament the arrival of the Digital Age, the overwhelming majority are on board. Either way, the technological advances are undeniable. “Digitalisation is really something you cannot change, it’s happening,” Helminen observes. “It’s just a matter of what’s the speed.”"

The Finnish company Transfluent specialises in making those messages heard across languages. There is a big difference between jam which “tastes like grandma used to make” and jam which “tastes like grandma.” According to urban legend one company ran its slogan through free translation software and didn’t discover the error until they were a laughing stock on social media. It may seem funny, but the company isn’t laughing. Their multimillion euro expansion was ruined by a fundamental mistake: don’t be lazy when communicating with your customers. Companies have embraced modern technology and new ways to talk with their customers, but these have only complicated matters. Online translators offer ease and speed, while good human translators provide quality. The Finnish company   tries to give the best of both worlds. “We stand in the middle of the so-called online translation services and traditional language service providers, as we produce agency quality, but delivered with speed and convenience,” says  , Transfluent’s co-CEO. “We find the best fit for various customer needs: our online translation widget is further enhanced by integrations to social media, e-commerce and customer support solutions.” Companies today need to translate more than slogans. They may have websites in multiple languages, offer ordering and support in different markets, and of course communicate with their global customers via social media. No business wants to wait days for their tweet to be translated, and so Transfluent has found demand for their speedy services. The company uses tens of thousands of human translators who are ready to work the moment a new job comes in. “We have seen positive development in all areas, both product and project business,” says Kovanen. “Historically we have at least doubled revenues every year, and based on the first quarter results we will continue this year with even more impressive growth.” The company uses tens of thousands of human translators who are ready to work the moment a new job comes in. Many are specialists in particular industries such as gaming, so they are able to properly translate the lingo. “Our customers are mainly businesses, but there is huge diversity within them, from small online retailers to sports clubs, globally operating consumer brands and renowned gaming companies,” Kovanen continues. “The translation needs are as diverse as our customer base: we translate applications, games, websites, presentations and other business communications. There is also a constant stream of customer support messages from the customers who have adopted our Zendesk plugin.” Zendesk is a California company which offers a cloud-based customer service platform to help companies serve and engage their clients. Transfluent also has an office in California to take advantage of the growing North American market. “We are looking forward to a major boost in our business in the US market,” says Kovanen. “We opened an office in Silicon Valley two years ago, and the hard work to enter a new market is now starting to bear fruit. We are currently focusing our sales and marketing in the US and Northern Europe. However, we see customers from all over the world: digital business has no borders.”"

The event, which took place in June, also marks the first time Flow Festival took place outside of Finland. The scene in Ljubljana looks no doubt familiar with its inviting purple, turquoise and white benches built from wooden pallets. This year,   celebrates its 12th anniversary. Originally held in VR’s old railway warehouses in Helsinki, the festival has grown over the past decade into a major event that has also garnered attention from outside Finland. Last year’s festival broke a new attendance record, with more than 60 000 visitors.  Last year   named Flow Festival as one of Europe’s best boutique festivals, and   ranked the Helsinki festival in the top ten best small music festivals in Europe. It was just a matter of time before Flow would venture outside of Finland. Flow’s artistic director   explains how Ljubljana came to be chosen as the site for the  : “The geographical location of Ljubljana and Slovenia is ideal – near the Mediterranean Sea and far enough south that at 9 pm on a midsummer’s night it gets dark out. There are also many neighbouring countries and cities within a 200 kilometre radius.” Like in Helsinki, Flow Festival Ljubljana was set up in an industrial environment. The Tobačna mesto industrial site was a tobacco factory in the 19  century, with administrative buildings and offices adjacent to the site. “In line with Flow’s ideology, it is especially places that have not had much – or even any – activity like this that can give rise to unique and significant events. Flow’s objective is to create something new – not just to respond to a certain environment. Correspondingly, the mindset has changed tremendously in Finland and Helsinki in the events industry in the past decade since Flow was started,” says Kallio. Kerttu Auvinen describes Ljubljana’s Flow Festival as an amazing experience. She likens it to Helsinki’s Flow, but without being an exact copy of it.  attended Flow Festival in Ljubljana. She recalls Tobačna mesto as a depressing place where she went to apply for a residence permit after moving to the city to study in 2012. “At first I didn’t even recognise the administrative building that used to be so familiar to me. It’s definitely out of the ordinary and simply lovely. It’s great to let loose and have fun in an area that was once mostly a source of frustration for me,” she says. The area at the back is full of stands selling local fare:   serves chick pea–avocado burgers and   whips up smoothies. Pop-up shops hidden in the maze of factory buildings offer up the creations of local artists. It looks and feels like Flow, but with a somewhat more intimate atmosphere. “The venue is similar to the Helsinki event, but it is definitely not an exact duplicate of anything I’ve seen in previous years of Flow,” Auvinen confirms. Ljubljana also tried out a new concept this year: an open-air salon with a hair stylist offering services to willing patrons. Swedish singer–songwriter  , one of the main performers appearing on Friday, was one such patron, sitting in the chair for a trim before his gig. Graffiti artists paint the wall next to the main stage where simultaneously Serbian hip-hop trio Bad Copy perform. An artificial climbing wall has been set up 50 metres away. A one-metre-high statue adapted from Ljubljana’s famed dragon symbol was built next to the Flow sign. “A local focus is extremely important,” says Kallio. “The idea behind Flow is to promote a local, grassroots approach and to link local and global aspects as diversely as possible.” Although the venue is interesting, music still takes centre stage. Among the artists featured at Ljubljana’s Flow Festival weekend were Roísín Murphy, Run the Jewels, Bonobo, Metronomy, Caribou and the Pet Shop Boys. The local context was also reflected in the music, which featured Ljubljana-based synthetic-pop band Torul, folk-inspired rock band Jardier, and Polona Kasal x KALU, playing melodic synths. As the night grows darker, a light show featuring Flow’s logos changing shape and colour begins on the wall next to the main stage. The old tobacco factory looks majestic, but dreamy and romantic at the same time. It’s at this point that the strength of the Finnish festival organisers shines through: exploiting the urban element and transforming a barren environment into a festival of lights. The atmosphere of the festival has also sparked the attention of the local residents. “Slovenians are usually quite sceptical when it comes to new projects, but this event was the talk of the town that weekend,” says Flow Festival Ljubljana’s press officer  . Zalokar praises the Flow team and says he will particularly remember the way the Finns dutifully kept to the precise schedule, right down to the minute. The Pet Shop Boys, the final act on Saturday night, announce that this is their first time performing in Slovenia. The crowd goes wild. “Since its inception, Flow has been an international event brand for us. By its very nature it was meant to be taken to global markets as diversely as possible. Our global conquest will definitely continue,” Kallio promises. Ljubljana’s old tobacco factory received a facelift for the festival."

This imbalance is driving Finnish startup Funzi to make mobile learning tools available to everyone — especially emerging markets. Women are a key education demographic for Funzi. “According to studies women bring home 90 per cent of the money they earn while men bring around 30 per cent” says Pohjavirta. “They can then employ men!” That sounds like a pretty good place to start. The Funzi team comes from a long background in the development of digital content and educational services. Now it wants to take this experience to transform how learning is delivered around the world."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/word-dive-created-a-clever-way-of-learning-languages/,WordDive created a clever way of learning languages,"WordDive from Tampere, Finland, pushes language learners to make use of several senses during learning. Now CEO Timo-Pekka Leinonen speaks four foreign languages, whereas before he struggled to buy a train ticket in English. A French couple asks me for directions in the city centre. They tell me, in French, that they can’t speak any other language – and I understand everything. In order to be of help, I still have to rely on hand gestures. What a pain! It’s been years since I studied French, and since then I haven’t needed anything more complex than “ . Even left and right have disappeared from my vocabulary. Leinonen used to have a hard time learning languages. He did pass his English matriculation exam, but when he went interrailing, he found it difficult to buy a train ticket or juice in English. Because of his hobbies, he wanted to learn Japanese. He tried different types of language learning programs, but none of them delivered. “The programs just weren’t that good,” he says now, almost 30 years later. Whilst studying at the University of Technology in Tampere, he decided to put his mother’s language teaching experience onto a computer. The DIY program worked well, and Leinonen kept on following the industry’s development. Leinonen founded   together with four other people in 2009; the service was launched in 2010; and the following year it was selected as the best eLearning solution in Finland. In 2012, the company got an honourable mention at the 2012 Productive Idea competition; in 2014, it was chosen as the Best Mobile Service in Finland; this year WordDive’s name is on Red Herring European Top 100 list. Will WordDive bring back my lost French? Starting to use the service is effortless. Whilst clicking on bubbles and writing words I notice how after seeing a photo or a drawing presenting the word, having it written in front of me, and hearing its pronunciation, next time I see it on the screen I don’t have trouble remembering it. In 2014 WordDive was chosen as the Best Mobile Service in Finland and this year its name is on the Red Herring European Top 100 list. Sometimes trying to interpret the photos gets annoying. How could I know that a picture of a woman next to a house means  ,  ? Again – next time it’s exactly that word I remember the easiest. According to Leinonen, what makes WordDive differ from other similar services is that it activates several senses simultaneously. WordDive also adapts to the needs of individual learners; for example, after a while the program starts to change the pace to match that of the user. Additionally, WordDive aims at encouraging speaking and interacting in a foreign language. “When one gains confidence with the basics, it’s possible to just focus on speaking the language. That’s where our strength lies,” Leinonen says. For the sake of testing, I give the highest available level of Spanish a go, but I find myself getting bored. Is WordDive not useful for someone who already knows the language, even if at times the subjunctive might slip out of where it should be? Not necessarily, Leinonen reckons. WordDive’s methods are surprisingly clever: in German, masculine nouns are recorded in a male voice, feminine nouns in a female voice, and neutral nouns in a third type of voice. ”If your language skills are on an advanced level, sure you might not need a separate service; you can practise simply by reading or watching films. However, if you want to become, say, nurse, and you’re not familiar with the vocabulary, the service will help.” WordDive doesn’t offer specialised courses to consumers, but schools use WordDive’s vocabulary courses to train, for example, machinery and metal technology students. How about a language I’ve never studied? I change the language to German, in which I can only say  ,  ,  , and a couple of swearwords. For starters the program tells me to write the word   in German – or at least the photo unequivocally is of an apple. How am I expected to know this? WordDive tells me both how it’s written and pronounced, and when I see the photo on the second round, I realise I remember it instantly. Some of the methods are surprisingly clever. In German, masculine nouns are recorded in a male voice, feminine nouns in a female voice, and neutral nouns in a third type of voice. By practising a word, I almost by accident learn its gender, too. The vast majority of WordDive’s customers are studying English. Leinonen believes that at some point WordDive will offer a selection of about 15 languages. The next language coming up will be Turkish. “We listen to what our customers want. For example, Estonian came along because one of our customers wanted to learn the language specifically with WordDive, and paid a big chunk of the expenses of the course.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/atol-avion-takes-flight-again/,Atol Avion takes flight again,"Amphibious Light Sport Aircraft are reinvigorated in Finnish Lapland. Consider this for a minute: Finland has some 188 000 lakes, the largest of which is Lake Saimaa at 4 400 km . For Finns, these fresh bodies of water represent summertime, relaxation and a place for a reinvigorating dip after sweating it out in the sauna. But, they can also have another unexpected, yet very practical purpose: acting as an aircraft landing strip. “Years ago when I was still flying long haul flights, quite a few of my colleagues started to buy seaplanes,” recalls pilot  . “They told stories of how you can visit all your friends at their summerhouses. I had a four-hour drive to our summerhouse, but it would only take one-and-a-half hours by airplane. I started to think why not.” Rekula approached  , whose light aircraft manufacturing business   was laying dormant. First emerging in the 1980s, the company had spent many years gathering dust in the hangar due to difficulties faced by the market during the Finnish recession of the early 1990s. However, once Koivurova was ready to commence Atol Avion’s second phase, not only did he agree to build a plane for Rekula, but he suggested that the experienced pilot and flight engineer join him as co-owner of the business. With his long career as a Finnair pilot soon drawing to a close, Rekula found himself quickly on board. Much had changed in the aeronautical world and Atol Avion was now positioned most favourably. Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) was first invented in the US some 10 years ago, enabling the transport of heavier loads than typical lightweight planes. “We are focusing on the global market,” Anssi Rekula states. “Our goal from the beginning was to make the best plane in its class. We feel we have achieved this.” “They are really popular in Scandinavia and Europe,” Rekula observes. “That’s the fastest growing market right now.” In order to meet this demand, Atol Avion has taken its former designs and modified them accordingly. Constructed from composite wood and carbon and glass fibres, the resultant ATOL 650 LSA is some 100 kilograms lighter than most on the market. This allows for two people to comfortably lift off – something that is rarely possible legally. Rekula points out the authorities are seeking to crack down on overweight loads in future, due to the many light plane accidents that directly result from excess heaviness. Atol Avion is thus poised to swoop in. “Our plane is faster and a lot safer,” Rekula explains. “It also doesn’t have any dynamical drags like floats. It is made to operate on the water.” Atol Avion is using Icon Aircraft as their industry benchmark, with the American company having attracted a swag of orders for their innovative Icon A5 light planes. “Their goal is to make 500 planes per year,” Rekula states, with a smile. “Our goal is to make 40-to-50 planes per year. So, if we can take 10 per cent of their market we will be more than happy.” He illustrates the scenario more succinctly. “The American car industry has always been strong, but there have always been people who want to drive Volvo, Saab, BMW or Mercedes. We are offering a different approach.” This approach is now rolling down the runway. ATOL 650 LSA’s maiden flight was successfully completed in April, and with five orders already in the pipeline and a crowdfunding round of 110 000 euros behind them the company is ready for takeoff. “We are focusing on the global market,” Rekula states. “Our goal from the beginning was to make the best plane in its class. We feel we have achieved this.” ATOL 650 LSA is constructed from composite wood and carbon and glass fibres and 100 kilograms lighter than most on the market."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lappset-makes-global-success-story-of-finnish-playgrounds/,Lappset makes global success story of Finnish playgrounds,"The Finnish company Lappset is a game changer in the business of play: these days the company offers products for everyone from children to seniors. The company’s next project is building Santa Claus-themed parks in China. Playgrounds shaped like ships, electronic playground equipment, bouldering and skateboarding. The strange thing is that, for the playground equipment manufacturer Lappset, it all started with Santa Claus. In the 1960s, a Christmas theme park was being planned in Lapland but funding was proving hard to come by. Many thought that the idea of an entire Santa Claus village was mad. Among the applicants was a young man wearing a wolfskin coat –  . When the project failed to take off, Ikäheimo moved on to other jobs. But he never forgot to retain a certain playful mind-set. Ikäheimo took on a new field: in the space of 40 years, his company Lappset Group has become a success story as a manufacturer and exporter of playground equipment. If you wander into the yard of a Finnish day-care centre, there is one thing you can be certain of: you will, without a doubt, find playground equipment branded with the name Lappset. The goal of the company and Lappset Group’s current Managing Director, Tero Ylinenpää, is to create fitness trends. The idea for manufacturing wooden playground equipment came about as a counter-reaction to the trends of the 1970s: yards full of metallic monkey bars and carousels. In Ikäheimo’s opinion playground equipment should not only look good, but also offer children challenges: develop their strength, balance and offer pedagogical solutions. Ikäheimo wanted to create safe, sustainable playground equipment out of Finnish wood. It wasn’t long before the company’s modern wooden products were receiving attention abroad. Exports began in the late 1970s to Denmark, Belgium and Japan. Today’s playgrounds look somewhat different compared to the 1970s. Nowadays, they might be built, for example, in the shape of a ship, where stories inspire children to go on adventures. More and more often playgrounds might feature a DJ table and dance floor, bouldering, a ball wall, parkour and skateboarding. Lappset proves that the concept of play is not limited by geographical borders. Currently, more than 70 per cent of the company’s turnover comes from abroad. Lappset equipment can be found in India, other parts of Asia, Australia, New Zealand and North America. The company has subsidiaries in seven countries. The company’s history is riddled with awards. It was presented with the National Export award by the President of the Republic of Finland in 1995. In 2000, Antero Ikäheimo (yes, the man from Lapland dressed in a wolfskin coat) was awarded an honorary title for his long industrial career. A lot has happened since then. The most recent event was when Ikäheimo’s younger brother  , who has spent his entire career working at Lappset, was also granted an honorary title by the current President of Finland  , due to his contribution to the field of physical education.‪ Risto Ikäheimo’s long-standing dream of a Santa Claus village came true when Santapark was inaugurated in 1998 and is now partially owned by Lappset. The story about Lappset and the Santa Claus village does not end there, however. In 2014, Lappset and SantaPark announced that they would be building a Santa Claus-themed park in Chengdu, China. Where does Lappset’s overseas success stem from? “We don’t just follow trends – we try to create them,” says Lappset’s current Managing Director  . The concept of play has changed a lot within the past 40 years. Lappset doesn’t see playing as the sole right of children. The company has created the 0–100 concept that offers health-improving sports activities for seniors and adults. Lappset has also taken part in successful co-operation projects. For example, Lappset has designed and built, together with Rovio, more than 10 Angry Birds parks in Europe and Asia. The company intends to construct five to six SantaParks in China. “I believe that the Chinese are touched particularly by the values that Santa and Christmas represent, namely, love, hope, sharing and caring,” says Ylinenpää. Characters from the Angry Birds game inspire children to play in Pori. The park is open to everyone and free of charge."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/on-the-trail-of-sustainable-business-at-slush/,On the trail of sustainable business at Slush,"Technology and startup conference Slush might still be perceived by many as a meeting place for game companies. In reality, the event draws all kinds of enterprises: for example, those seeking financing for businesses that promote sustainable development.  Sometimes the best thing about travelling is meeting the local people – moments where you suddenly blend into the crowd and become part of someone else’s life. This is also something the founders of   have experienced while travelling in developing countries. These experiences led to the idea of a web-based service through which travellers can find accommodation with a local family. The majority of the accommodation fee goes to the host family, and a portion goes to the community’s village bank and to Duara. “We want travellers to see where their money goes and how their trip affects the life of the local community,” explains  , one of Duara’s three founders. Duara Travels was entered in the Finnish Trade Register a bit over two weeks ago, and the team is currently looking for a programmer. Although its technical realisation is still in its infancy, the company’s business model has been under planning since May. “At the moment we have a pilot community in Tanzania. Our plans are to expand within Africa, and in Asia and South America such that we have a few countries on each continent. At Slush, Duara Travels is seeking partners and meeting with investors. “We are also trying to take in all of Slush’s energy – you never know what surprises lie ahead,” says Vierros. Another company hoping to gain financing and energy from Slush is  , a Finnish online store where customers can purchase a meal of their choosing from a buffet restaurant. The meal can be discounted by as much as 90 per cent, because the customer can only pick up the food as the restaurant is closing. Buffet restaurants produce a lot of left-over food that Buffet Go wants to put within reach of consumers. “I have been interested in entrepreneurship and companies that can positively influence global problems for a long time,” explains  , CEO of Buffet Go. “Food waste is generated in all stages of food production, but one of the biggest waste sources is especially buffet restaurants. I thought that I could establish a company to address that problem.” The service is currently in use in Finland and Denmark. Valtonen says the intention is to expand to any city in the world that has buffet restaurants. Finding markets should not be a problem, as he has so far not encountered such a service anywhere else. , developer of a mobile gift service, is heading to Slush for the second time now. At its first foray into Slush, the company presented its mobile app. This time, the intention is to network even more and to meet investors. With Finnay’s app, the user selects the town where the person to be remembered lives. From the town’s range of options, the user selects the appropriate gift, say, baked goods from the local bakery, which is delivered to the recipient on the same day using a local courier service, wrapped and complete with a personal message. “The service is considerably cheaper than regular postal service. In addition, this kind of gift-giving is more environmentally friendly and doesn’t cause major emissions in transport,” says  , Finnay’s CEO. Thanks to Finnay, small local companies receive greater visibility. That’s the motivation behind the company wanting to collaborate also with other startups. Lindström hopes that will happen at Slush. Gifts can already be purchased in Berlin, London and Tallinn. The company is in the process of launching the service in Amsterdam and Stockholm and is seeking financing for a launch in the US market. According to Lindström, the service can essentially be launched in a new city in just one day: all it takes is a local partner and a courier service. Sounds like the ideal company for global expansion. Riikka Lindström (left) will make Santa’s work a little easier when Finnay expands its selection of shops before Christmas."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/reforged-studios-sets-off-with-usd-2-5m-chinese-backing/,Reforged Studios sets off with USD 2.5 million Chinese backing,"It is not every day a mobile gaming company lands a million euro investment just months after launch. But this is exactly what the experienced team behind Helsinki-based Reforged Studios has achieved. ,  ,   and   have reason to celebrate. The founders of eight month old gaming company   have just secured a 2.5 million-US dollar (2.3 million euros) investment from the Chinese technology giant Net Ease to bring their first game to the global market. It is a major door opener for the Finnish startup. “Net Ease publishes two of the biggest and most profitable games in China. They have a strong track record as a publisher in China, but also strong investments in Western companies,” says Vilén, CEO at Reforged Studios. “Many of their portfolio companies are similar to us in that they have been founded by gaming industry veterans who have big plans and the ability to make them happen.” Reforged ticks all the right boxes. Its core team boasts over 100 years of combined experience in developing global gaming brands, including some of the world’s biggest game titles  ,   and  . Now their ambitious plan is to reach the same level of success by developing mobile games for hardcore gamers – the first of which will be announced later this year. So what is Reforged working on? Instead of trying to attract casual gamers, the company has its sights firmly set on skilled and dedicated hardcore gamers, much like the founders themselves. “We will start with the fantasy battle army genre and create a fast-paced game for mobile, but one that players will want to take seriously,” explains Vilén. “We will build long term games people will continue to play for years and years.” Reforged Studios is the brainchild of gaming industry veterans Teemu Vilén (left) and Tuomas Pirinen. The successful funding round means Reforged can now turn its full attention to product development. This includes adding new game developers to the company’s existing team of nine before the end of the year and growing the company to around 20 people in the course of the next year. “This investment will help to take our product to test market in 2016. Our strategy is to make durable, highly quality games which means the budgets are higher than with casual games,” says Vilén. “We are building a company that doesn’t push out a game after game, but focuses on a single product at a time and makes it a success. The core development can take 2-3 years and, if everything goes well, the game will then be further developed for years to more.” In fact, it is the founders’ passion for quality games that defines Reforged. Vilén wants to create a company culture which harbors creative freedom and design innovation and, consequently, appeals to the best gaming talent. “The single most critical factor for any gaming company is its team. Good people make good games,” Vilén summarises. Finland may have built a reputation as a mobile gaming superpower, but it wasn’t the self-evident home for Reforged. Vilén himself was still living in the US when the founders-to-be compared the pros and cons of such gaming hubs as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and London. Finally the scale tilted in favour of the quality of life offered by Finnish capital Helsinki. “It was a sum of many factors. We considered how easy it is to focus on creative work in the different cities, what the development costs are etc.,” Vilén recalls. “All places have their strengths, such as tax breaks in Canada and the UK, but what carried the biggest weight for Finland is that childcare, education and healthcare work so well. In day-to-day life they cause less stress and costs than for instance in the US.” Vilén also brings up Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, whose financial support for startups and growth companies was a major incentive for Reforged in setting up the studio in Helsinki. Still Reforged is far from a one country company. In targeting a global audience, it already has two developers working remotely from LA and the partnership with Net Ease gives it a future advantage in entering the growing gaming market in China. Furthermore Reforged wants to bring a bit of American attitude to Finland. “Finns are extremely good at producing high quality products, but don’t necessarily know how to market them and quality doesn’t mean anything if people can’t find your games,” Vilén concludes. “You need to make noise and be openly proud of yourself. We want to combine this American drive for success with the Finnish quality.”"

How to organise a massive pile of receipts after a trip and then split the costs between friends? Or what if you want to be an entrepreneur, but you don’t have any accounting qualifications? How about when an opportunity to buy your first apartment comes knocking at your door, but you need to pack your bags immediately for a long-awaited trip to California? How to be sure that your personal finances can manage all this? Thankfully, financial technology has made the leap into digitalisation and a wave of fintech companies emerging from this disruption are now solving our problems. “Scrooge was born during a skiing trip in Japan in 2011,” recalls the company’s CEO  . There were six of us altogether who went to Hakuba to search for world-class powder and enjoy the food culture and life itself. After the week-long trip it took around two weeks to sort out who had paid what, where the receipts were and who owed what to whom.” Three of these avid skiers thought that such problems should not exist in the 21st century. They started to search for a suitable application that would save them from any receipt disasters in future. “We found several apps but none of them were practical enough, so we decided to make our own. The whole project started as a hobby but when we came up with a business concept for it, things got serious.” Scrooge’s market is global, as tracking costs and settling debts with friends is a cross-cultural issue. Only a smartphone is required in order to use the Scrooge fair splitting app. Soon you can even link your debit card to the app to settle your debts within a few clicks. “Our biggest competitor is paper and pen and people’s own memory. People still retain receipts to track costs and the most responsible one of the group is then forced to split them. Scrooge offers an easy way to sort your debts and lets you focus on the essential: having fun,” Saastamoinen summarises. Scrooge App tracks costs and settles debts with friends. Samu Saastamoinen and Janne Haila came to Slush to meet potential partners, investors and new users. Financial administration can be a pain for every entrepreneur or startup. Zervant’s founders set out to make running your own business as easy as working for someone else. “If you have the passion and desire to be an entrepreneur, paperwork and admin should never stand in the way,” says Zervant’s CEO  . Zervant’s software is aimed at small businesses in the service sector. The company has not chosen an easy industry, as the digital financial sector is highly competitive. “We don’t want to compete with traditional accounting solutions,” Hansson explains. “Existing solutions are so feature-rich that small business owners often feel overwhelmed. We’re focusing on disrupting the old order of things and bringing a new and fresh approach to an age-old problem.” Zervant is available in five languages, with users spread across 140 countries. Its fastest growing markets are in France and Sweden and the UK is next on the list. “The UK is a very competitive market, but we also know that there is huge potential,” says  , Zervant’s UK marketing manager. “To establish ourselves in the UK will take a lot of time and effort, and even though we’ve only been actively working in the UK for six months, we’ve seen great growth during that time.” Zervant’s team contains people from seven different countries and daily communication between colleagues is conducted in five languages. Can this be a disadvantage? “The cons are largely anecdotal, and mainly come from misunderstandings. Telling the time is a good example. In France and the UK when you say ’half 10’ you mean 10:30 am but in Finland and Germany when you say ’half 10’ you mean 9:30 am. Making sure everyone turns up for a meeting at the right time can be tricky!” Hills states, with a chuckle. Hansson and Hills are not the only ones who believe that the software has potential: the company has, to date, raised a total of over four million euros in investments. “We’re still only at the start of our journey, but in the long run we’re aiming to be the biggest and most popular invoicing service for small businesses in Europe,” Hansson says. Planago sees the whole of Europe as its home market, as it helps users become financially independent. Planago’s founder and CEO  proposes a question: “Would you like to be financially independent?” “Planago can calculate that in 2060 you’ll reach financial independence with your current way of handling money,” he explains. “Would you like that day to become sooner?  If so, what should you do to make it happen, and how much do you want to invest in your quality of life at the moment compared to your wealth, which will have an effect on your future? All of this can be calculated beforehand. With Planago you can build your wealth.” Planago helps people to make smarter choices with their money. Whether you’re buying a car, an apartment or changing a job, which all can have an impact on your budget, Planago calculates what financial decisions are viable to accomplish, and still keep your budget in balance. The effectiveness of Planago’s planning tool has also been tested unintentionally: “Our coders are around 25-30 years old. While they have been testing our tools, they have started investing in funds and buying their first apartments as a result,” Vänskä laughs. Although Planago’s personal finance platform is only one side of the startup, the platform has additionally been used for developing educational financial games. On top of that, Planago has also offered their platform for game studios to develop new kinds of financial games that are based on real market data. Planago also gives a hand in investing: “If you’re not investing any money, you are dependent on your monthly income,” Vänskä states. “If you lose your income, you’re left with nothing. But if you have investments, which are bringing you capital and would also cover your monthly costs, you’re financially independent. You wouldn’t have to think about what you’re going to do. You could pick and choose your jobs.” Several bankers, merchants and real-estate investors have noticed the platform’s worth and have invested in the company. The personal finance platform can be adapted to banks’ needs to attract their present and future clients. It makes sense that banks and other financial institutions are Planago’s main clients: with relative newcomers like Bitcoin and Paypal starting to override them in the transaction market, banks need all the help they can get to develop modern financial models for their customers’ demanding needs. “We have already started working with some of the global banks, even though our product launch is yet to come,” Vänskä reveals."

The German online retailer only   Helsinki tech centre in August and it is already reaching out to new businesses with a coaching program called ‘Tech Startup Residency’. “We are still a startup ourselves, the company was only founded seven years ago. Of course we have grown a lot during that time and been successful in the ecommerce space, but we haven’t forgotten our roots,” explains  , Helsinki Site Lead at Zalando. “Now we want to give back to the startup community and help new companies to overcome those difficult first hurdles in their path. There are a lot of people in Helsinki with great ideas and we want to give them a chance to succeed.” Currently Zalando is searching for innovative startups in the fashion and e-commerce space for the first batch of its program which will kick off in early 2016. Up to two startups will be chosen to take a three-month residency in the company’s Helsinki office. They will get a fully equipped workplace and facilities as well as access to coaching sessions and mentoring from Zalando’s experts across all business areas. Kytömaa himself will act as the head coach. “The startups get to discuss with people who have done and experienced these things in practice,” says Kytömaa, himself a Silicon Valley veteran with a background in tech and entrepreneurship. “This is the most valuable kind of help.” There is plenty to learn from. Since 2008 Zalando has grown from a two-man startup to the leading online fashion platform in Europe with an annual revenue of close to three billion euros. It is the learnings and insight   including mistakes, pivots and surprises  the company has gained along the way it now wants to share with other digital entrepreneurs. The Helsinki-based startup program is first of its kind for Zalando, but plans are already in place for its expansion: Zalando opens its door for Finnish technology startups. “We are not planning to do this only once, but to build a continuous program,” says Kytömaa. “What needs to be kept in mind is that we are applying the current lean and agile startup models here, so even we don’t know exactly what is going to happen. Instead we will see how the first program goes and then adjust it as needed. Our aim to is have several startup batches every year.” While the program mainly focuses on refining the chosen startups’ business models and products, goals are set individually for each company based on what they want to achieve. Kytömaa notes they are looking for great ideas that connect people to fashion. The startups can be at different stages, anywhere from building prototypes to something more advanced. “It is entirely possible that Zalando could become a partner or customer for some of the startups, but it is not the primary goal at this stage. Now we are looking for mutual fit and ideas where we think we have a lot to contribute,” Kytömaa adds. Zalando has so far hired 25 people for its application-focused tech hub in Helsinki and hopes to grow the team to as many as 200 inside the next few years. However what originally attracted Zalando to the Finnish capital was not only the talent available, but also the city’s vibrant and active startup community: “There is a really strong startup scene here, good attitude and a lot of technology and design know-how which is a combination that suits us well,” says Kytömaa. “We want to create even more buzz in Helsinki.” The company has already had success with that. At the Slush startup conference in Helsinki last week Zalando’s startup program attracted so much interest that the application period was expanded until the end of November. But the tech residency program is only the first step in the company’s wider plans for the Finnish startup community: “On a more general level we want to promote innovation and in the long run help to build a significant e-commerce ecosystem [in Finland]. Supporting innovation also outside our own company will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem,” Kytömaa concludes. At the first stage Zalando is looking for one or two innovative startups in the fashion and e-commerce space to take residency in its Helsinki office."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/fourdeg-gives-heating-costs-the-cold-shoulder/,Fourdeg gives heating costs the cold shoulder,"Given the prevalence of cooler months here up north, it’s unsurprising that an innovative approach to heating has emerged from Finland. Winter in Finland typically means sub-zero temperatures, thick blankets of snow and frozen lakes and sea. Yes, you read correctly: salt water can actually freeze! With up to six months of Arctic chill each year, Finns have learned to adapt in a number of ways. Layered clothing is a must, as are winter tyres on your car, triple glazing for windows and regular visits to the sauna. Now, local company   is further extending the level of comfort by offering an automated solution for buildings heated by water radiators that can be controlled in the palm of your hand. “With Fourdeg, people can tune their own indoor climate as they wish, within certain safety limits,” explains CEO  . “They control it via the phone or pad app, adjust every room and can make a schedule.” Nonetheless, 90 per cent of users rely on Fourdeg’s automated system, with its proven learning algorithms facilitating temperature control throughout the whole building with ease. No programming, setting up parameters or system knowledge is needed. Meanwhile, for the statistically curious, detailed reports and temperature analyses are readily available. Like so many Finnish innovators at present, the company emerged in light of Nokia’s declining fortunes. Drawing on their earlier experience with building automation, the three former colleagues combined their knowledge and set about gauging market interest. I hope we are a positive example of ‘constructive destruction’ “We visited the best customers for this kind of system and asked if they would need this kind of thing,” Makkonen recalls. “They said yes. Then we asked had they been offered these kinds of things before. They said no.” Striking while the iron was hot, the company was swiftly established in early 2013. Boosted by support from Finnish funding agency Tekes, Fourdeg built their first prototype, utilising learning algorhythms developed with Aalto University. A two-man crew then spent three hours altogether installing the inaugural system in a two-story midsized office building. This was done during a regular workday, with office employees remaining undisturbed during the process. The system was up and running automatically some 15-30 minutes later, exactly as they had planned. The Fourdeg solution reduces energy costs between 10-35 per cent, depending on the type of building and its insulation. This is nothing but good news for district heating companies, their main clients. The Fourdeg solution reduces energy costs between 10-35 per cent, depending on the type of building and its insulation. “We can balance the district heating network loading, their own production costs, so they have cost reduction there,” Makkonen explains, before pointing out another significant reduction: the use of carbon dioxide. “Companies have the opportunity to join in the energy efficiency business, making them more competitive. They can also provide new services for their customers; more and more digital services, which will ensure the end user quality and lots of savings in building maintenance.” Others have been quick to point out the benefits of the system. After winning the 50 000-euro pitching competition at the Arctic15 conference, Fourdeg was recognised for its business-to-business model of supporting the ecosystem and its modern approach towards the Internet of Things and cloud software setup. And so, with their days at Nokia increasingly further behind them, the Fourdeg trio stands in the warm glow of an optimistic future. “I hope we are a positive example of ‘constructive destruction’,” Makkonen states. “With the telecom ecosystem collapsing a bit in Finland, people who are talented and experienced now have opportunities and must do something new.” The competition is heating up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startups-motivating-work-communities/,Finnish startups motivating work communities,"Good management and wellbeing at work are growing topics. They were also apparent at the recently ended Slush event for startups. We met with three Finnish companies that share the same basic philosophy: When a company’s employees are fulfilled and motivated, they work better.  “Decision-making is an expert’s most important task and a necessity for any organisation. People feel passionate about their work when they feel it is meaningful and when they get to influence and be part of the dialogue. Although good decisions are essential for an organisation, there are very few tools for making them,” says  , the founder of  , a company that specialises in decision-making. At Fingertip, decisions are seen as a journey, not just as a choice between different options. The company has developed a program that digitalises decision-making and the execution of decisions. In the application, decision-making follows a seven-step process. The participants have clear roles, so that everyone has a firm understanding of their area of responsibility. “Fingertip can be used to make small or big decisions: decision-making always starts with a problem, challenge or idea – for instance, ‘We are launching our product in South Africa’. After going through each of the steps, from initial idea to final evaluation, the decision-making process is closed. The process can take 30 seconds or ten years,” Pellosniemi explains. Jaakko Pellosniemi from Fingertip was thrilled at the opportunity to present the company’s app and to meet investors and other startups. Fingertip has attended several events to share information about how to enhance decision-making. These encounters have produced results: Fingertip has eager customers around the world and in Finland. The work continued at Slush, which the company attended for the second time, this time mostly focusing on networking. “Even that involved a lot of decision-making: we decided to be part of this event and have learned that it is worthwhile,” states Pellosniemi. Finnish   approaches the internal motivation of employees through their emotions. The company has developed a tool to help determine the real-time workplace atmosphere through employees’ intuitive responses. From three possible options, the employee selects the emoticon that best depicts how he or she is feeling at that moment in time. The employee can also comment on how he or she is feeling. The emoticon and comment are anonymous and openly displayed in a real-time ‘vibe feed’. The company believes that when employees see how their peers are feeling and can read their comments, it creates a better understanding of the overall picture. Openness also forces the organisation to change, if necessary. “Many studies show that management only knows about 20 per cent of what happens within the organisation. The real-time vibe feed brings the familiar vibe at coffee-table conversations to the management’s knowledge,” says Vibemetrics’ CEO,  . “This helps the employee feel as though he or she is being listened to and that there are benefits to providing comments.” The service in Finland has some 1 400 users a day. Expansion outside of Finland was one reason the company wanted to take part in Slush, where it had a stand to market its tool and meet investors. “Slush is a really great event. It’s a fantastic opportunity for Finnish companies and Finns to simultaneously gain visibility and globalise,” says Ruokojoki. Another demo point at Slush featured Trainengage, an online training tool developed by  , a Finnish startup founded in 2012. “Organisations can use the Trainengage service as part of various training programs, for example, in change management or in inducting new employees. The objective is to turn training into a game: the training includes, for example, a video that explains something new, as well as tasks set up in the form of a game for each employee,” explains Cloudriven’s marketing director,  . “If you are a Finnish startup, you can’t miss Slush!” says Janne Haonperä from Cloudriven. The company believes that coaching, and thus the work, becomes more meaningful if the employees can apply the things they learn directly to their everyday life and can monitor their development through an interactive game. According to Haonperä, the company is determined to expand globally, as Finland is too small of a market for this kind of service. “Our target is the US, where matters related to wellbeing at work are really on the crest of a wave. So far we have been able to finance our operations and product development using the cash flow from our other technology products. For our expansion, however, we are seeking financing from external sources,” says Haonperä."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/richie-makes-modern-day-mobile-media-profitable/,Richie makes modern-day mobile media profitable,"Newspapers and magazines are competing for their readers’ time – and money – with countless other things. The mobile solutions created by Finnish Richie make readers stay on the pages of a digital paper, and advertising is added subtly yet efficiently. When a newspaper wants to become digital, it doesn’t make sense to create each new application from scratch. The CEO of  ,  , already knows what’s expected from digital publications and their advertising. “We build software that maximises the turnover coming from each customer. When we make the user experience the best it can be for, for example, a newspaper’s mobile application, the user will want to spend more time with it, which directly affects their willingness to pay for it and the effectiveness of its advertising.” According to Karppinen, the other extreme end in the media industry are companies that focus on gathering clicks from mass audiences. On the other end there are quality publications, which target a more limited audience – one which is ready to pay for functional and high-quality content. Mobile platforms are sold in different ways, too. Some sell ready-made packages with little room for modification, and some build a new application from the very beginning. Karppinen says that Richie tries to find a happy medium. “We’re searching for an optimal point by creating components that can be used in building very different types of end products.” “On the global scale, Finnish speakers are few and far between. Hence we’re hoping that each new market we step into will grow at least as big as or bigger than Finland,” says Marko Karppinen. Richie’s products are known as Richie Ads and Maggio. Maggio offers a newspaper experience for those who want to read their papers and magazines in a traditional way, but digitally. Richie Ads is an advertising solution that complements Maggio. “The ad banners blinking on websites have never worked well, and advertisers need to constantly come up with more and more annoying ways of catching attention. Richie Ads doesn’t interrupt the reading experience, because adverts work like they do in a printed paper. Hence they get attention without blinking lights or extra clicks.” Richie’s customers use Ads and Maggio both together and separately. Typically publishers want to integrate Richie’s building blocks into their own applications. New products are up and coming. Although the already existing selection has plenty of built-in features, some of them are turned into individual products so that customers’ specific needs can be met. A lot of big media houses in Finland use Richie’s technology. Next year the company aims at getting most of its turnover from abroad. A new office was recently opened in Stockholm, and there are ongoing discussions in Britain and Denmark. “On the global scale, Finnish speakers are few and far between. Hence we’re hoping that each new market we step into will grow at least as big as or bigger than Finland. New countries would multiply our business pretty rapidly.” The story behind Richie begun in the early 2000s, when Karppinen’s then-company started creating applications for Apple computers. When iPhones and iPads appeared, the team already had years of experience in their coding language. Karppinen says that media houses and newspaper companies quickly turned out to be the biggest customer group. “During those years we developed plenty of applications for news, and so we learned what works and what doesn’t. We started to take advantage of these lessons when we founded Richie.” Although the name has changed, the team remains almost the same. Now Richie consists of 15 people, and the vast majority of the work is done in the Helsinki office. Still, even some Finnish customers don’t realise Richie is Finnish from head to toe. “A few times people have thought we’re a retailer of some US product called Maggio,” Karppinen tells. All the same, business has been booming: last year the turnover exceeded a million euros. Because sales are only going up, Richie is looking for new people, especially those with software development skills. New market areas are also waiting to be conquered, so Karppinen says they’re intending to expand the sales team as well. “We made it big in Finland without much sales effort, because customers came to us on their own. I don’t think the same will happen abroad.” The mobile solutions created by Finnish Richie make readers stay on the pages of a digital paper."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/study-advisory-makes-choosing-universities-student-friendly/,Study Advisory makes choosing universities student-friendly,"Every year a handful of esteemed academic indexes rank universities on a global scale. But do these really give prospective students the information they require when deciding where to study? When   was about to graduate high school 10 years ago she was faced with a mere quintet of possibilities where she could pursue university education in her chosen field. Nowadays, if she were to be standing on the threshold of adulthood, the opportunities before her would be seemingly limitless. “Now students don’t just go to the nearest university, the field is all over the world,” she explains. “They can go and study anywhere. Students should be able to choose the best university for themselves.” , the company she co-founded, helps facilitate this. A ‘Trip Advisor’ for universities, the online platform taps into the social aspect of studying by offering students the chance to share feedback and first-hand insight related to their experiences at some 12 000 universities around the world. “It’s easy to use, like Google,” Lahtinen illustrates. The seven founders of Study Advisory each come from different backgrounds. Drawing on their collective expertise they have fine-tuned the platform over the past two years with the help of Finland’s Aalto University, Tampere University of Technology and Häme University of Applied Sciences. We have built a totally new kind of rating that ranks universities globally based on social interests. What they have deduced is that in spite of all the bluster surrounding major university rankings that are published each year, students themselves rarely pay attention to them. In fact, according to research carried out by the company only seven per cent of youngsters feel that such rankings are the most important factor when deciding their future university. “It’s hard for students to find relevant information,” Lahtinen observes. “We have built a totally new kind of rating that ranks universities globally based on social interests. We have designed it together with students so it actually matches their needs and desires.” International students often pay hefty fees to study abroad. Study Advisory has identified this business-like scenario, emphasising the need for them to be seen as paying customers and their feedback collated in the one location. Whilst it remains free for students to use the platform, universities have the opportunity to embellish their basic profiles and make them more attractive to prospective students via a trio of different pricing options. “We wanted to be affordable for everyone: African, Asian and American universities,” Lahtinen says. “The basic idea is that it’s easy for universities to add videos and photos there, anything they want.” Since emerging in September 2015, Study Advisory has already attracted institutions in Asia and Europe. “Universities are taking this well, but some are a bit concerned,” Lahtinen admits. “If we say we are the ‘Trip Advisor for universities’ some are worried about receiving bad comments.” But, as she explains, student feedback is screened before it is posted. Almost all reviews thus far have been extremely positive and have included nice practical tips for future students. And regardless, any constructive criticism can only go towards improving the university experience in the long run. “We are changing the climate here; students should have their voice heard,” Lahtinen says confidently. Study Advisory, a ‘Trip Advisor’ for universities, helps to compare almost 12 000 universities all around the world."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/dodreams-stays-ahead-of-the-game/,Dodreams stays Ahead of the game,"How can a business stand out in a crowded market? Differentiate? Target a specific market? Choose a clever name? Games studio Dodreams went for saturation. “I believe quantity beats quality,” explains  ’ CEO  . At the helm since February 2014, Pöntiskoski has brought a fresh approach to the company that was established in 2008. Rather than stick to the well-worn path of working on a single game every year or two, Pöntiskoski had other ideas. “We changed our strategy when I became CEO,” he recalls “We started to develop these mini games, self publishing these simple projects that a couple of guys could do in a couple of months at most. Then you have less risk of failing. Even Hollywood studios release 10 films a year – one does really well, a few okay and the rest fail.” And so, of the 10 titles released in Dodreams’ first year under Pöntiskoski, multiplayer sensation   became a runaway hit. “The reason why   is so successful is that the premise is simple,” Pöntiskoski explains. “You score points by hitting your friend in the head with a car. It always makes people laugh. It’s silly; you want to try it out.” Many have: the IOS game was downloaded a million times in less than a week of its release, and became profitable within a couple of days. Things had finally paid off for the CEO. Previously working as a lecturer and a PhD candidate, Pöntiskoski was bitten by the startup bug four-and-a-half years ago. Dropping everything, he set about pursuing his dream. “I did that for about three years and failed miserably,” he recalls. “It always felt like the next idea would be better than the previous one.” “It only took four-and-a-half years to be working as a successful entrepreneur,” says Erik Pöntiskoski. With head hanging low, he decided to cut his losses and return to education. “I went to some meetings and realised there was no way to go back. I would rather fail as an entrepreneur than do that work again.” The chips soon fell his way. After applying for the newly vacant CEO position at Dodreams, its board agreed that he was the man for the job. A wise choice. Even though he had no prior experience with a game studio, Pöntiskoski skilfully steered the ship towards more profitable waters. Alongside saturating the market with different games, his background in app design and commercialisation saw him encourage his staff to tackle less explored revenue streams. “We spent 50 per cent of our time working on client projects,” he recalls. “We did a children’s game for Sanoma Pro, for example, and our developers taught coding at a community colleague. The rest of our time was spent making small risk minimum investments to develop our own games.” With three million users around the world enjoying  , the team has since reined in its expansive interests. All of their energy is now channelled into creating updates for this one title, released every two weeks. Rather than try to strike gold with another game idea, Pöntiskoski is quite realistic about Dodreams’ prospects. “History has shown that very few small studios like ours are able to come up with a completely different IP that is another success,” he explains. “I’m happy with our situation. I’m experiencing something that only one in a 1 000 entrepreneurs gets to experience.” He pauses for a moment. “It does feel quite sweet after completely failing for three years. It only took four-and-a-half years to be working as a successful entrepreneur.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/striimin-takes-global-film-industry-online/,Striimin takes global film industry online,"The film and TV industry is increasingly headed online and Finnish streaming technology company Striim.in is helping to take them there.  You have a great movie, but how to get it distributed and in front of audiences? This is a major question for any movie production and   believes his company has the answer. Helsinki-based   has developed a fully customisable online video streaming platform for movie and TV companies around the world. “Online and mobile distribution is still in its infancy. Movie companies need our kind of players who are experts in the technology, but also understand the distribution chain,” says Kujala, CEO and Founder of Striimin. Netflix comes to mind, but Kujala shies away from the comparison. He emphasises Striimin is a technology provider and licenses its cloud-based streaming platform to content providers who want their own, branded video channel similar to BBC iPlayer or HBO Now. The client keeps the full power over their content and pricing. “We build the whole platform from scratch to follow our customer’s visual image. We implement the payments systems, visual design, dashboards, in practice everything,” Kujala explains. “It doesn’t require any technological know-how from the customer. All payments go through us and every month we pass the customer their share.” While Striimin focuses on technology, its roots are deep in the film industry. The first version of the video platform was already built in 2012 when Kujala needed an alternative distribution channel for a small Finnish movie he was producing. Kalle Kujala sees online distribution as the best way to keep smaller movies alive and financially viable, as movie theaters are increasingly reserved for blockbuster films. Striimin was founded a year later to take the platform global, but initially it didn’t take off. Although the film industry is now waking up to the opportunities of online distribution, Kujala believes the first release of Striimin was too early to the market. “We quickly realised we had to change our business model to what many companies were looking for: licensing our video streaming technology,” Kujala recalls. “So we threw away our first product and started from a clean slate.” The development work has paid off. Today Striimin claims its technology is ahead of any competitors in terms of customisability and cost-efficiency. While this has attracted the European film industry’s interest, the company has also found a real boost in turning its focus to a new market: Africa. Currently Striimin is building online platforms for several TV channels in Africa and has signed deals with three major  . This is no small feat considering the Nigerian film industry, known as ‘Nollywood’, is worth over five billion US dollars and is the second largest film industry in the world after India in terms of the sheer number of movies produced. Consequently while most startups eye the US market, Kujala sees the biggest opportunities in African and Arab countries. Particularly if you operate in the entertainment industry. “The global entertainment and media industry grows around 4.9 per cent annually. The growth in Africa is much higher, for instance in Nigeria it is 15.1 per cent. We need to focus where the growth is highest,” explains Kujala. “In many African countries analog networks have been stripped down. This means TV channels need to use the Internet and mobile to find audiences and revenue. We make it possible for them to build their own advertising and subscription based video platforms.” Striimin has been working in Africa since early 2015 and Kujala has already learnt there are plenty of misconceptions about the continent. He encourages all companies to look beyond the cultural differences before making any conclusions. “There is a lot of money and customers in Africa and many opportunities for growth companies,” Kujala says. “But you can’t go to Africa just like that, you need to have contacts there. They are not interested in what you have done abroad, instead you need to have someone local to recommend you. It is all about contacts and good references.” Striimin itself has received support from the Finnish Foreign Ministry and is even considering opening an office on the continent in the future. As Kujala explains Striimin wants to offer the best video streaming technology in the world and this means working in a close partnership with its customers. “Movie theaters are an option only for a small portion of all movies, they have been reserved for the content of huge corporations…This is the new way to distribute, consume and monetize movies,” Kujala concludes. “Film industry in Nigeria alone is huge. The ‘Hollywood of Lagos’ represents an industry worth over five billion US dollars,” says Kalle Kujala of the opportunities in the African market."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lovia-creates-sustainable-products-with-a-story/,Lovia creates sustainable products with a story,"Finnish design brand Lovia didn’t want to see valuable materials thrown into trash bins. Lovia produces sustainable and locally sourced luxury, and some believe it’ll be the next international success story of Finnish design. When   worked as a designer for an international department store, she started to feel the strain. It wasn’t just the amount of work that got to her; what added up to the exhaustion were the scandals echoing from faraway places regarding the unethical practices of the industry. Despite the plentiful certificates held by her employer, Korpilaakso felt like she couldn’t know for sure what was going on in the factories and their subcontractors in Asia. “I started to realise this isn’t what I want to do, and the feeling grew stronger and stronger. I quit my job due to a burnout, which was partially fuelled by the ideological conflict I was experiencing.” Korpilaakso describes quitting her job as “an opportunity to rearrange the pieces of the puzzle”. She didn’t need to wonder whether or not she had the courage; there were no alternatives. The puzzle pieces turned into the design brand  , which has been deemed to become the next big thing of Finnish design. Korpilaakso and her three colleagues share the goal. “Hopefully we’ll be known around the world not only for our unique designs, but also for transparent production and sustainability.” Transparency is essential to Lovia’s ideology. Each product can be traced down to its origin, and all items carry a written introduction of its makers. Thanks to Lovia’s openness, the production process isn’t hidden in social responsibility reports or behind factory doors. Normally designers create a collection, and only then start looking for materials. Lovia decided to overhaul traditions: material comes first. Vast amounts of valuable and high-quality materials are wasted in the world, and Korpilaakso wanted to bring them back to life. Lovia makes use of, for example, sheepskin from an organic farm. Another material that’s gained a lot of attention is leather made of elk hide. Lovia makes use of, for example, sheepskin from an organic farm. Another material that’s gained a lot of attention is leather made of elk hide. All materials are sourced as locally as possible. Korpilaakso says that Lovia is interested in all sorts of surplus materials, be they from farms or recycling centres. Now Lovia produces bags, clothes, and jewellery, but there’s no reason not to expand to areas like interior design if suitable materials happen to be available. “Lovia isn’t a fashion brand; it’s a design brand. We don’t want to fit a category, as we’re ready for all sorts of challenges.” Finding collaborators has proven to be labour-intensive. Korpilaakso laughs as she explains how they’ve spent a lot of time going through phone books. “A channel through which we could try and find professionals in Finland or Estonia simply doesn’t exist,” she points out. Initially the founders of Lovia thought they could keep production almost fully in Finland. However, it turned out that the expertise required to produce Lovia’s bags simply wasn’t available in the country. Now some of the bags are made in Estonia, some in Italy, where even the most demanding techniques can be used. “We wanted production to stay as close as possible. We met the goal, but “close” just isn’t as close as we imagined.” Lovia was officially founded in July last year. Korpilaakso and sales manager   had worked together before, and PR manager   met them during an entrepreneurship course at Aalto University. Photographer  joined the team later. Indirectly, Lovia offers work to various professionals, from people who tan the sheepskin, to bag producers. Korpilaakso is hopeful that one day the team itself could be expanded. So far Finland has been Lovia’s biggest market, but the focus has been international from the very first steps. The spring collection for next year was showcased at the Tesla showroom in Copenhagen. Lovia’s products are available in three international online stores. According to Korpilaakso, Lovia’s eyes are now on Copenhagen and London. Although competition in a place like London is tougher than at home, possibilities and opportunities are more plentiful, too. Lovia’s only target isn’t just to increase its own sale and conspicuousness, but also to employ people in sustainable production practices. The core idea is to provide customers with elegant items with nothing to hide in their production. ”There’s a vast amount of brands all over the world, but not many of them work sustainably. Fortunately a lot of young professionals view sustainability as indispensable.” Lovia’s spring collection 2016 was showcased at the Tesla showroom in Copenhagen.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/presefy-changes-the-geography-of-presentations/,Presefy changes the geography of presentations,"The presentation tool Presefy, created by four university students, brings presentations to the audience members’ personal devices – no matter where they are in the world. The company’s technology is utilised in a new online service developed by the London Stock Exchange Group, and if all goes to plan, no lost memory stick will ever delay yet another lecture. All over the world, an immense number of presentations, speeches, and lectures are given every single day. Anyone who’s been to at least a handful of events knows the story: first the pen drive is lost, then the text is bouncing up and down due to scaling issues… During their university studies,   and his now-colleagues took note of these problems. They started to wonder how to make every single lecture begin smoothly, without lost devices or problems with compatibility. The team created a solution:  . The demo of the service brought them a place in Startup Sauna’s mentoring programme for startups in spring 2012, and now Presefy has users all over the world. “This year alone, Presefy has had visitors from 168 countries,” CEO Rönkkö says. The cloud-based service enables saving Powerpoint presentations, which can then be shared onto people’s personal mobile devices. Hence every single detail is as visible to the front row as it is to the backbench – not least because the programme scales and optimises the presentations automatically for each device. Presefy also makes it possible for students to save the presentations without having to copy them manually. The presentations can be downloaded directly from Presefy. When Presefy started gaining more and more users, the entrepreneurs noticed that the service wasn’t used as much for live presentations as it was for remote ones. “The service can be used to complement conference calls or video meetings. Now we’re developing the service to suit those needs,” says Rönkkö. “Both remote work and the usage of mobile devices are constantly increasing, and wireless networks are expanding and improving. We want to create a widely used presentation technology that works easily and for everyone,”says Presefy’s CEO Eero Rönkkö. The basic service is free. Anyone can upload two presentations and present them without restrictions. Additional services, such as password protection, come with an annual fee. “The free service brings us visibility, so that both people and companies become aware of our existence. It also gives our potential customers a chance to see how it all works.” Presefy also offers the technology it’s created to be used in companies’ own platforms; in other words, companies can integrate presentation tools into their own services. One of the biggest customers is the London Stock Exchange Group. According to Rönkkö, Presefy wants to be seen as a global technology partner. “Presefy.com isn’t our only service. We also produce presentation technology that companies in various industries can use to improve their own services.” The service is widely popular internationally; only one and a half per cent of their users are in Finland. The vast majority, about a quarter, are in the US, and the rest are spread out evenly all over the world. The quartet responsible for Presefy created the product on their own. According to Rönkkö, they have a dream team, because two of them have technical expertise and the remaining two are business professionals. Rönkkö describes their hometown Oulu as an excellent place for new enterprises. “A lot of work has been done here to boost the buzz within the startup scene. Oulu is a wonderful centre for startups due to its diverse events and professional and helpful people. In Oulu, people understand that helping others can’t be hurtful.” The cloud-based service enables saving Powerpoint presentations, which can then be shared onto people’s personal mobile devices. In addition to the four co-founders, Presefy has two strategic advisors who jumped on board during Startup Sauna. They’ve also recently employed a salesperson, who will help create new B2B contacts and contracts. Presefy has ongoing negotiations and service testing with other companies. One big potential market is event organisers. Rönkkö says that Presefy doesn’t target its advertising or marketing to specific countries or areas. Rather, growth has occurred naturally: when someone gives a presentation on Presefy, the whole audience will get to know the service. “We’re focusing our sales efforts on companies, which might be less visible than consumer marketing. Amongst consumers it’s more about word of mouth.” The entrepreneurs firmly believe that one day Presefy will be the most used presentation technology in the world. When the day will come, Rönkkö doesn’t know for sure. “The sooner the better. That’s definitely what we’re going for. Both remote work and the usage of mobile devices are constantly increasing, and wireless networks are expanding and improving. We want to create a widely used presentation technology that works easily and for everyone.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-spruce-resin-heals-around-the-world/,Finnish spruce resin heals around the world,"Spruce trees have a secret weapon: their resin fights off bacteria. Now these healing powers have been harnessed by Finland’s Repolar Pharmaceuticals and it is targeting international markets. Spruce resin is one of nature’s little gems and it has been used for healing purposes for centuries. But gone are the days of relying only on old traditions. After years of clinical and laboratory tests, Finnish medical company   has developed a series of spruce resin-based products for the treatment of both acute and chronic wounds, burns and fungal infections. “Nature-based products are seen positively around the world, but the challenge is their varying quality. Some work, some do not. This why we emphasise scientific research,” says  , CEO of Repolar. “Everything we do and what we claim about our products is based on medical research.” Repolar was started in 2006 by four doctors  ,  ,   and   and in this time its popularity has grown significantly. The company’s resin salves, lacquers and washes have found their way into homes and professional use, with over 100 hospitals and health centres in Finland alone. Repolar’s biggest seller is its first product ‘Abilar 10% Resin Salve’ launched in 2008. It became the first ever natural preparation to get an approval from the Finnish National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health and receive the European CE mark for medical devices and products. Abilar’s credentials were further boosted this September. It was qualified by UK’s National Health Service (NHS) for medical reimbursement opening up a market of over 60 million Brits. “The UK is one of the most demanding countries in the EU to get an approval for registration and medical reimbursement,” says Jokinen. “It is a strong indication of our product’s effectiveness and cost-efficiency.” When working in a health centre in Lapland, Arno Sipponen noticed that even troublesome wounds recovered using the so-called “Laplander’s resin salve treatment”. But why spruce resin? The sticky liquid first peaked the curiosity of Arno Sipponen in 2002 when he was working in a health centre in Kolari, Finnish Lapland. He noticed that even troublesome wounds not reacting to the usual treatments recovered using a local remedy: the so-called “Laplander’s resin salve treatment”. Intrigued, Sipponen formed a cross-disciplinary research group to discover whether this was due to chance or science. What they found were the components that help spruce to fight off bacteria and fungus also have powerful antimicrobial, wound healing and skin regeneration enhancing effects. Now the same components are put in use in Repolar’s medicinal products for both people and animals. The raw resin used in Repolar products is collected by hand from spruces in Lapland. It is then purified and refined using Repolar’s patented methods and sent to its partners in Finland and Greece for manufacturing. “The resin is collected from living trees without harming them as that guarantees the high quality of the resin. [Healthy trees] have all the right components in the right balance,” Jokinen explains. Repolar’s current research focus is on a new manufacturing technology the company developed two years ago. It makes it possible to transfer the active components of resin into a stable water solution. “There is the potential to develop many new water-based products with this technology,” says Jokinen. “We have already launched an ear wash for veterinary use and we are introducing two more products [one for people, one for animals] this year.” It is safe to say Repolar punches above its weight when it comes to international markets. In addition to the NSH registration, the company’s team of four has taken its resin products to Sweden, Germany, Austria, Greece, Cyprus, Australia and New Zealand. “Growth is challenging with the resources of a small company, but we are actively looking for new partners in different markets,” Jokinen says. “This year we will go to two more EU countries and several other negotiations are underway.” Repolar is also keen to grow outside Europe particularly in Middle East, Africa and Asia while keeping a strong R&D focus: “We have high ambitions,” says Jokinen. “There is still a lot of potential to develop and launch many more effective resin based products. We believe that strong growth is driven by new products and new markets. ‘Sprucing up’ just took on a whole new meaning. The raw resin used in Repolar products is collected by hand from spruces in Lapland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/video-sharing-seeks-to-put-everyone-in-the-luup/,Video sharing seeks to put everyone in the Luup,"Practically everyone has a video recording device in their pocket these days. Yet there remains a dearth of smartphone apps that successfully harness the creative possibilities at our fingertips. Now, thanks a group of Finns and Brits, the landscape of video and communication as we know it is set to irrevocably change. When starting a business, some set modest goals for the near future. Others, meanwhile, set the bar a little higher: “The simple ambition was to do for video what Instagram did for photography,” explains  , CMO of  . “By that we mean make it really easy and quick to produce beautiful short movies.” Each Luup HD video comprises of four-shots of footage spliced together that can be displayed on the Luup website and also shared via social media. The idea was originally developed in Helsinki by some of the Nordics’ best-known investors. Among these was prominent Finnish tech entrepreneur  , who “saw there was a place in the market for a video experience, and basically decided to start developing the product that became Luup.” Luup wants to to give users the tools to produce beautiful short movies with ease. Whilst Luup’s initial appeal may lie in its visual possibilities, where it differentiates itself from other video creation apps is with an emphasis on audio. “Music is central to the experience,” Wells explains. “You choose music first, which determines the pace of what you are shooting. With the four shots that you shoot, the timing is then synched to the music.” Although there are a number of tracks readily available for use without a price tag, Luup also seeks to challenge traditional channels of music procurement. “We see Luup as an opportunity for musicians to distribute music and engage with their fans,” Wells states. “We are getting involved with artists and striking up deals, so that for a small fee they can sell their music in the app.” Some of the acts already offering their material for Luuping include Finnish electronic rockers K-X-P, and local conductor and musician . “We want to make sure music is central to our experience and that we work with the artists and not against them,” Wells emphasises. So, with users having enjoyed the opportunity to put their chosen sights and sounds on Luup for a handful of months already, just who exactly has embraced the app? “We see some great stuff coming up on the Luup site from a growing array of users,” Wells observes. “These include people that are into film, and who are also very sociable. Because you can share through Whatsapp and Messenger, you can almost have a conversation through shooting short films. It’s a very creative and diverse bunch.” The app has quickly cultivated a groundswell of positive feedback. Given the company’s roots, it’s unsurprising to discover that most of Luup’s users are currently based in Finland. “We like to think of the Finnish market as a great way to introduce Luup to the world,” Wells declares. “Our ambition lies much further afield as well.” News that the Apple App Store in the UK recently selected Luup as Best New App confirms its wider appeal. Wells also points out that Luup users are found in a total of 10 markets including the USA, Canada, Germany, China, Sweden and Australia. This is merely the tip of the iceberg, it seems. “What you see at the moment is an indication of the potential of Luup,” Wells continues. “But it certainly isn’t where we think the end of journey is.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/solu-sets-out-to-change-the-system/,Solu sets out to change the system,"After 30 years of Apple and Windows duking it out over who has the best operating system, a new player has boldly entered the race.  just landed in Helsinki a few hours ago. Along with the inevitable jetlag, the founder and CEO of Finland-based company   has another reason to feel a little weary. He has returned from the United States, where his company finally launched the product they have been developing over the past 12 months under a veil of secrecy: an innovative cloud-linked computer. “It’s been pretty exhausting I have to say, for the whole team,” he states. “We really pulled off a few minor miracles to get things to work the way that they did. We had a nice turn out at the launch. Overall I’m really happy.” And so he should be. Upon Solu’s announcement the Internet immediately lit up with a mix of wonderment, confusion and heated scorn. Regardless of the nature of the feedback, Lawson and his team are satisfied: people are reacting to their product. That is what happens when a groundbreaking innovation muscles its way onto the market, directly challenging the tried-and-true way something is done. So, what exactly will users have on their hands when the device ships in May next year? Solu is a portable pocket-sized computer that can also be plugged into any monitor to produce a crisp 4K image. Once connected to a larger screen, the device’s 10 cm  surface becomes a touchpad, which can be paired with a keyboard. Its sleek wood-encased design has set tongues wagging in the aftermath of the launch. But, as Lawson emphasises, it’s what’s under the hood that really matters: a powerful 2.3GHz processor that’s driving a completely new approach to the computing experience. “The idea is all based around hooking up to the Internet in a way that has not been done before with an operating system,” he explains. “It basically acts as a huge buffer, a cache for everything that is stored in our cloud environment.” Any concerns regarding hard drive limitations, backups or application installations are now a thing of the past. Offering unlimited storage and ease-of-use, Solu is designed to meet the needs of the modern working environment. “We’ve done away with the separation between applications and files,” Lawson explains. “Users just zoom in to the content that they want to use. It’s very natural and intuitive.” Facilitating a communal workspace with ease is another key area in which the operating system seeks to stand out from its competitors. I want my mum to use this. Her backup solution at the moment is a whole bunch of USB sticks and even floppy discs. “It’s completely not in Apple’s blood to do anything that’s collaborative,” he observes. “If you look at iCloud at the moment, you can share documents, but it’s incredibly clunky. And, once anybody goes offline – boom – you can’t do anything.” This crippling concern of the 21st century – being disconnected from the Net – is another problem combated by Solu’s operating system. The device works smoothly offline until the user is back within Wi-Fi range, upon which time it automatically synchs any changes made. The Solu business model is also very much of this century. After acquiring their device, users then pay a fixed monthly subscription fee that gives them unlimited storage and access to apps. With a number of products already in the pipeline and an eye also on the education sector, Lawson is gearing up for affecting monumental change worldwide. Having already co-founded Holvi, the disruptive online banking and accountancy service, he is no stranger to this process of implementing big ideas. While astronomical costs initially prohibited the realisation of his dream when he first came up with the idea for Solu 15 years ago, now the only thing that remains is attracting a global customer base. So, what type of user is Solu targeting? “Ultimately everybody,” Lawson states. “I want my mum to use this. Her backup solution at the moment is a whole bunch of USB sticks and even floppy discs.” [laughs] Solu’s device also works smoothly offline until the user is back within Wi-Fi range."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ductor-fuels-change-for-the-biogas-industry/,Ductor fuels change for the biogas industry,"After a groundbreaking discovery, this Finnish company is tapping into three global megatrends. To get a sense of how committed   is to making a positive impact on the biotech industry, one only needs to learn that the company’s CEO   is its most significant investor. For Ketola, reaching into his own pocket a handful of years ago was a no-brainer, after company research discovered a new way of producing ammonia. “From day one I felt this is such a big invention, it is really worth investing in it,” he recalls. “There has been only one known method for producing ammonia [until now] and that’s the Hartford method, created 100 years ago from natural gas.” This breakthrough represents a seismic shift for the biotech industry as a whole. The detrimental impact of ammonia creation is set to be a thing of the past, with Ductor’s technology diluting the heavy polluting process. How much so? It is projected to cut CO2 emissions by some 1.5 million tonnes. Established in Helsinki in 2009, Ductor has developed a unique fermentation system that removes more than 60 per cent of nitrogen from organic waste before biogas fermentation. Alongside providing nitrogen control and process stabilisation for biogas plants, this process also utilises cheaper, more diverse feedstocks than before. The chief hindrance to a flourishing biogas economy has been the considerable expense of widely used maize, which gives the energy boost for liquid animal manure. Other expensive crops such as sugar beet, sugar root, grain and potatoes also help to create sufficient gas production. Ductor’s technology harnesses the power of under utilised and high nitrogen biomasses such as chicken manure. Even feathers can be used in its financially viable alternative. “With this technology, we are now solving the biggest problem for the biogas economy: high opex coming from expensive feedstock and the disposal cost of digest,” Ketola explains. “Biogas is actually cheaper than wind power and solar power per produced kilowatt hour, but the problem lies in opex.” Setting out to successfully prove its concept, Ductor embarked on its inaugural pilot in Helsinki last year. We have incredible demand in the market. We are rolling out, and we will change the world. After the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany evaluated the process with positive results, things have moved swiftly. The company established its Ductor GmbH office in Dusseldorf and the technology is set to roll out to German biogas producers. “We have several customers already in the pipeline,” Ketola says. “We expect to deliver the first Ductor add-on in Q2 next year.” Many other markets have raised an eyebrow in interest, as the technology can be added to any biogas plant as a pre-process with throughput times of less than 48 hours. Research shows that the European biogas industry alone has the capacity to generate a further one billion euros in profit, thanks to Ductor’s innovative approach. Ketola also notes that its customer contacts are eagerly awaiting its fast approaching American roll out. The US represents a virgin market for biomass utilisation and Ductor technology can unlock billions of tonnes, in turn helping the US to achieve its climate change targets. Alongside the production of biogas, Ductor’s microbiology-based technology can also improve waste management and food production. Ductor can help free up over 811 000 ha for food production from energy crops. Meanwhile, important food production components can be supplied as fertilizers in a sustainable way. “The world is moving more and more towards these mega trends,” Ketola emphasises. “We have incredible demand in the market. We are rolling out, and we will change the world.” Ductor has developed a unique fermentation system that removes more than 60 per cent of nitrogen from organic waste before biogas fermentation."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tuuti-piippo-presents-future-female-tech-leaders/,Tuuti Piippo presents future female tech leaders,"Think about the most influential leaders in technology. The founders of world-known companies like Google, Apple, and Samsung. How many women leaders cross your mind? Not many. This is something that Finnish author and journalist Tuuti Piippo wants to change. Tuuti Piippo has recently published a book about women in technology. The book,  , tells stories of women who have become technology creators. The idea of the book was born when Piippo realised that women are not as interested in having a career in technology as men. Therefore her goal is to inspire girls and women to see, how technology can be created and used for a wanted purpose. Piippo herself has been interested in technology since an early age. Constantly thriving to understand new things and phenomena, Piippo programmed her first website at the age of 11. It was a fan page for her favorite band, Hanson. For the past two years Piippo has been working for a Finnish health tech startup   in California. “Life and work in the US have been intense and interesting,” Piippo says. Silicon Valley has stroked her as a place where you’re surrounded by technology-oriented people who want to change the world. The US has such a wide variety of consumers, even what is considered a niche product in Finland can establish a large customer base there. “The level of ambition you see there is pretty amazing.” During her time in the US, Piippo has met many inspiring women that have influenced her.  For example the stories of Caterina Fake, one of the creators of photo sharing service Flickr and Natalie Panek, a future astronaut, have made it to the  . San Francisco and Silicon Valley have changed Piippo’s point of view towards work life. According to Piippo, doing business in Europe and in the US are two completely different things. “There’s no reason to stay in Finland to test a product’s potential if you wish to launch it in the US. Finland’s market size is so much smaller and timewise it takes longer for people to embrace a new product. Also, as the US has such a wide variety of consumers, even what is considered a niche product in Finland can establish a large customer base there.” Piippo thinks that being a Finn is an advantage when it comes to working in an international environment. And it’s all because the way the Finnish society works: “In Finland we have a mix of strong technical skills, but most of us also know how things should work when they work well, and how they should look, as well.” The Futuremakers is planned to be published in English in the near future, but before that Piippo has already another project on her hands: a book about health tech pioneers. It seems that we will be hearing more from Tuuti Piippo soon."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sooma-helps-to-elevate-the-mood/,Sooma helps to elevate the mood,"Treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders is poised to come into the home, without the aid of medication. Given the stigma that has often been attached to major depressive disorder, the wider social acceptance that has begun to pervade is a welcome reprieve for many sufferers. However, a suitable approach to treating the illness remains a bone of contention. Whilst the majority still respond favourably to pharmaceuticals and therapy, an increasing number of patients are turning to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to restore normal brain function and alleviate their often-debilitating symptoms. This is where   comes in. “Our product is a small portable brain stimulation device,” explains  , Sooma’s CEO and co-founder. “It’s used in different sizes of healthcare facilities for the treatment of depression, by patients who haven’t gotten benefit from pharmaceutical treatment, or don’t want pharmaceutical treatment.” Showcasing tDCS’s impressive remission rate of 40 per cent, the company’s first product, the Sooma tDCS stimulator, became available at the end of last year. Given that Sooma has only been around for two years, it has been a rapid road to development for a company that specialises in medical devices. Neuvonen established Sooma with his colleague . Having both worked in the field of brain stimulation for a number of years, the duo set out to develop a more effective method for the treatment of depression. It’s used by patients who haven’t gotten benefit from pharmaceutical treatment, or don’t want pharmaceutical treatment. “We noticed that there is more and more evidence in this technology we are using,” Neuvonen recalls. “We realised at some point in the near future there could be a clinical application that used it.” Financing was swiftly secured from both public and private sources. Finnish funding agency for innovation Tekes was quickly on board, along with capital injections from VC companies Lifeline Ventures and Finnvera. “We initially had a different clinical indication in mind and a different technological solution,” Neuvonen recalls. “After we discussed with investors we found more interesting and more mature clinical applications. This gave us a different focus, which was good.” A discussion of depression treatment inevitably turns to the quagmire of side effects endured by patients who are prescribed pharmaceuticals. With Sooma, these are relatively rare. “Some people have itching under the electrode, or tenderness of the skin,” Neuvonen explains. “There may be also short duration headache. But these are pretty mild side effects.” Neuvonen also reminds that whilst some patients claim to experience the effect of the Sooma tDCS stimulator treatment immediately, the general consensus is that its benefits arrive in a gradual manner, over the course of two or three weeks. Sooma has developed a small portable brain stimulation device for the treatment of depression. Sooma also seeks to facilitate self-administered care in future, by developing a range of tDCS stimulators suitable for home use. “Some illnesses are such that you need daily or weekly treatment for the rest of your life,” Neuvonen explains. “This is something that’s probably best done at home at some point. We have to take that step carefully, to understand the benefits or if there are any risks to the use of the device at home.” Neuvonen concedes that as Sooma is not the sole tDCS stimulator on the market, such lofty plans are part of the company’s global push towards developing new features and technology in order to maintain its competitive advantage. “Currently we can sell this device in EU, as we have the CE mark,” he explains. “We also have regulatory approvals in Malaysia and we are looking to expand toward the North American market and bigger Asian countries as well.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/helsinki-startup-village-designing-the-future-of-health-technology/,Helsinki startup village designing the future of health technology,"The headquarters of health technology giant GE Healthcare in Vallila, Helsinki hide within their walls a bustling village society. Both small and large companies in the Health Innovation Village feed off each other’s energy and networks. “The objective is to create innovations that will revolutionise the future of healthcare,” says  ’s  , also jokingly known as village chief. Kauppinen participated in launching the concept, the purpose of which is to assist health tech startups and boost companies’ networking. The  , established in summer 2014, provides facilities for more than 20 companies, some of which are only just starting up, while others have already taken the next step. The “villagers” are united in their efforts to create products where technology facilitates healthcare instead of impeding it. User-friendliness is one of  ’s assets. The company, which made its home in the village in August 2014, came into being when its founder   was out skiing. First came the idea of monitoring health without wearable devices. This was combined with the idea of an operator that could harness the latest technology into a complete service for private and public healthcare. Healthoperator’s purpose is to speed up the implementation of technology by introducing an operator model for the healthcare sector. The company’s first product, the OMAseniori security service for seniors, operates using sensors, which makes it unnecessary to wear a bracelet or press a button. The sensors monitor movements and sleep intervals, collect data on the person’s daily routines and send an alarm if a sudden deviation occurs. The product is designed to be as effortless as possible for both senior citizens and companies. “We have received universally positive feedback. Customers in municipal health care stare at us incredulously when they hear what our product can do,” says Sales Manager  . There are benefits to being a tenant in GE’s premises. Rautiainen and Tiuraniemi both feel that both networking and the provided office facilities are obvious advantages. “It is important for startups to get out of the home because having a separate office gives structure to a business,” says Tiuraniemi. “The goal here is controlled chaos, which is a deviation from GE’s normal way of operating. There is a freedom to pitch ideas and experiment,” says GE Healthcare’s Mikko Kauppinen. Some of the village’s startups are heading straight for foreign markets. The key destination for  , founded by  , is the United States. The idea for the company sprung out of Ratamäki’s own life when her youngest child became allergic to “just about everything” and the entire family had to rethink their diet. There was, however, only a scattered offering of information and recipes available. When most of her child’s allergies had been overcome, Ratamäki wanted to help other people find information more easily. Miils provides users with ready-made weekly meal plans and offers information on their nutritional value. In addition to allergy sufferers, the service’s users include many kinds of people who want to think about what they put in their mouths – or rather think less and let the service decide the week’s shopping list. “A lot of vegans have been grateful for our service because it helps them ensure that they get the right balance of nutrition,” Ratamäki says. The company transferred to the Health Innovation Village in autumn 2014 and the reputation of the global General Electric Company has helped open new doors. “Miils’ subsidiary in the United States received excellent banking services after we revealed that we were selected as tenants for GE’s startup facilities,” says Ratamäki. According to Mikko Kauppinen, the variety of collaborative efforts between the startups and larger companies advance innovation. GE benefits by learning new ways of operating from the agile newcomers. ”The shift would come from somewhere else in the end. Instead of waiting for the disruption and protecting ourselves against it, we are cultivating it because that benefits everyone in the sector the most – and thus ultimately the patients,” says Kauppinen. One of the original inhabitants of the village,  , is an example of how a network can help to break new ground. Trail keeps track of all asset-related information for a company: when it was acquired, how it has been maintained, where it is located and when it needs to be renewed.   and   developed their asset management system for performing arts institutions but their customer base soon expanded to schools and healthcare. “Without the networks we gained here we would never have been able to enter into negotiations with the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa or become aware of what healthcare sector companies need,” says Klemetti. The company has doubled its customer base within the space of a year with the list now including an increasing number of significant cultural institutions from Australia, Latvia, Sweden and Scotland, among other places. The Health Innovation Village is also growing rapidly and the Vallila premises will soon be expanding to accommodate more startups. “We cannot force innovation to happen, but we can set up the best possible conditions for it. New ways of thinking emerge when the right people meet,” Kauppinen concludes. GE Healthcare’s second Innovation Village was launched in Cardiff, Wales. It is based on the concept created in Helsinki but with a focus on life sciences."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-sea-tech-plans-big-splash-in-the-world-s-oceans/,Finnish sea tech plans big splash in the world’s oceans,"Finland may be known for Nokia, Angry Birds and forests, but where the country wants to tap next leaves the land behind altogether: the smart maritime industry. There aren’t many ships today that sail without technology and its role in the maritime industry is growing fast. Tightening safety, environmental regulations and rising fuel prices are driving the development of new solutions which improve processes and efficiency. This is the domain of the ‘smart maritime industry’ and in particular its integration of information communications technology (ICT) which is used for everything from new ways of applying weather data to digitalisation of harbour bureaucracy. Or, in future, even for fully automated vessels controlled from the mainland. Finland wants to be at the forefront of creating these solutions. Step forward is the country’s new ‘Smart Maritime Technology Cluster’, the  . The ambition of Merit is to melt the maritime industry, ICT services, the Internet of Things (IoT) and startups together to create a Finnish maritime IT cluster that caters to international shipyards and the offshore industry as well as shipping companies and ports. “The smart maritime industry is built on two strong Finnish industry sectors: the maritime industry and ICT. Finland is top of the class in both,” says  , senior analyst at consultants Oxford Research, which recently conducted a study on opportunities in the sector. While there is no shortage of Finnish maritime know-how, the challenge is to bring together very different industries, working cultures and even terminology. The Merit Project, led by Finland’s capital city Helsinki and funded by the Finnish Ministry of Economy and Employment, aims to knock down these barriers by first offering a platform for networking and cooperation. “Someone told me 17 forms have to be filled in to ensure a container is carried from one harbour to another,” explains Eniram’s CTO Jussi Pyörre as an example on why smart maritime technology is needed. “Even if it isn’t our core competence, we could help [as part of the Merit cluster] to create solutions for these kinds of problems.” “The unique approach here is that we are actively seeking growth and new ideas from the ICT side by bringing together players from two different fields,” explains Nissilä. “It is a competitive market, but there aren’t many countries which have profiled themselves as the frontrunner in the smart maritime industry.” The potential of doing so is huge: in Finland alone the maritime industry is worth in excess of five billion euros while around 90 per cent of world trade is transported by the shipping industry. Finland is already home to a number of leading companies in the maritime industry, including global giants like Wärtsilä and ABB in engines and propulsion systems. Furthermore many of the world’s biggest cruise ships have been built in shipyards in Western Finland while Aker Arctic, a specialist in arctic seafaring conditions, runs the only privately owned ice model testing facility in the world in Helsinki. Several smaller companies are making their mark in maritime technology, such as optimisation specialists Napa and Eniram. Now Merit is bringing together their maritime expertise with the ICT sector. “The great thing about Finland is that we are a small country and can efficiently do these kinds of projects [such as Merit] without it becoming too bureaucratic,” says  , CTO at  . Eniram is not only a member of the Merit project but one of the most successful examples of recent Finnish smart maritime expertise. The company, founded in 2005, specialises in energy management technology and uses data analytics to reduce seafaring costs and environmental impact: “Our system is installed on 250 vessels all around the world. Last year we helped to save 60 000 tonnes of fuel in these vessels,” Pyörre explains. “That equals to the emissions produced by 40 000 cars in a year. We have 70 employees, so each of them is responsible for removing over 500 cars from the planet when it comes to emissions.” Eniram estimates there are approximately 60 000 ships globally that could use its technology and this is also where Pyörre sees the main benefits of the Merit project: targeting potential customers and developing new services together. “What customers need are solutions to their problems, not software. If we can offer a part of the solution, we are more than happy to be included in a package which is offered together with other companies,” Pyörre describes. “In the [Merit] cluster we could together create a complete solution for the customer.” Furthermore, these ideas could be tested in Finland. Notably Oxford Research foresees a test environment for smart maritime technology which will be up and running in Finland inside the next four years. This could be a test harbour or cargo vessel for trying out future navigation and communications or other ICT and IoT tools in real-life conditions. Merit’s long term goal is to turn the smart maritime industry into recognisable international brand similar to that of Finland’s mobile gaming industry. Because the biggest splash doesn’t always need to come from an Angry Bird. The maritime industry represents a huge but fairly traditional market in need of new ways of optimising and improving its processes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/unmonday-wants-to-shape-the-future-of-wireless-audio-2/,Unmonday wants to shape the future of wireless audio,"Competition in the audio market is fierce, but Finnish startup Unmonday believes success lies in taking the unconventional route in design and functionality. The company is behind the world’s first wireless multi-channel speaker with a unique control system. The hexagon shape of  ’s wireless speaker, ‘Unmonday Model 4.3’, catches your eye. It is a stylish portable device with a handmade vitro porcelain enclosure and canvas grill designed to fit any room in the house. But the real secret to the shape lies in its clever motion-based control method: the user can turn the speaker onto different sides to toggle between different modes or tilt it upside down to mute it. “Starting from the materials, we have wanted to do things in a slightly different way. The speaker is ceramic and a hexagon which means it also has six audio channels,” explains  CEO of Unmonday. “The built-in motion sensor detects when the speaker is turned from one side to another and changes its mode…If you have two speakers and rotate one to the right and one to the left, they will start to stream stereo sound. It is a very intuitive control system which no one else offers.” Furthermore up to five Unmonday speakers can be wirelessly connected to fill the house with Hi-Fi sound or to create different speaker groups for various rooms. When you are on the move, the speaker lasts up to 8 hours on an internal battery and it repairs automatically with your home speakers when you return. No fighting with wires or complex set ups. The simplicity and versatility of Unmonday’s speakers stem from the company’s founder  Back in 2011, Jämsén could not find an audio system for his home which combined stylish design and multi-use scenarios with wireless operation and great sound quality. As a partner in a design company, he decided to solve the problem by creating one himself and in December 2013 the Unmonday Model 4.3 was launched as the first wireless multi-channel speaker in the world. The name ‘Unmonday’ has a double meaning. It refers to the early days of the speaker when it was worked on only at weekends and Unmonday’s dedication not to produce any ‘Monday pieces’ (a Finnish saying that the worst work happens after the weekend). “Most of our competitors have focused on speakers as single, separate units,” says Illi. “There are some companies which can already do similar [sound system] things, but they don’t offer the same easy-of-use and in sound and component quality we rate very well.” It is an exciting time for the Helsinki-based startup as an updated version of its speaker, ‘Unmonday 4.3. Vol II’, will hit store shelves in October. It will be manufactured in Finland like its predecessor, but where the original Unmonday speaker works with Apple Airplay and Wi-Fi, the new speaker adds support for Bluetooth, Spotify Connect and Internet Radio making it compatible practically with any smartphone or tablet available. As the speaker itself is only equipped with a power button, Unmonday is also launching new smartphone apps to offer users more control over their listening experience. Despite all the updates, Unmonday will keep the speaker’s distinctive design intact: “We haven’t used any cheap gluing techniques, instead the speaker has been built in a way that it can be completely disassembled in five minutes if you know what you are doing,” says Illi. “If something was to happen, all the main components can be changed so our speakers offer a very long life cycle.” For most of the year Unmonday has been deep in product development mode thanks to the closure of a   in December. But with the Unmonday 4.3 Vol II launch looming its three member team is shifting focus to sales and marketing. With the Unmonday speaker already globally available from the company’s online store and through resellers in the UK, Italy, France and Finland, the startup’s major aim is to grow its reseller network. The company is first targeting design and audio conscious consumers in Europe with expansion plans to the US following closely behind. Entering a highly competitive market is a major push for any small company, but Unmonday believes its unique product and unconventional design approach will help it stand out from the crowd. Furthermore, the market appears to moving on its favour: “A few years ago wireless speakers were considered only for travel use, but now the mindset is changing,” Illi says. “All protocols, applications and audio quality start to be on such a level that even if you have very demanding taste, you can seriously consider a wireless audio system as the main sound system in your home.” The premium audio market has never been more competitive, but with the launch of the Unmonday 4.3. Vol II it also has a new competitor unlike any other. The design of Unmonday’s wireless speaker serves both visual and functional needs. The hexagonal shape acts as an operating system while the handmade front grill can be changed to match the user’s prefered colour."

The Helsinki unit starts with a dozen people but may employ as many as 200 in a couple of years. Zalando’s new Helsinki unit concentrates on the research and development of new customer-facing products, more specifically on developing carefully targeted mobile applications. “Each Zalando site has its own unique focus,” says  , Zalando’s head of tech expansion. “In Helsinki, we work on consumer-facing products, including mobile applications, backend, user experience and design. We will look deep into how people want to buy, share and interact.” Zalando set up its Helsinki office quickly and efficiently. The company’s first meeting regarding the new unit took place in February, plans were announced in May, and the site was up and running at the end of August. Behind the scene, however, Zalando has put tremendous effort into researching various European cities and talking to numerous people, authorities, other tech companies and startups on the local scenes. “We received significant help from local authorities and organizations like Helsinki Business Hub and Invest in Finland,” Lamik says. “They assisted us with recruiting staff and finding premises, and they put us in contact with all the right people – helped us become part of the community, really. The more local knowledge you have, the smoother it is to set up operations. “Introductions and on-the-ground relationships are crucial for example in recruiting. We received insights to a whole network of contacts and recommendations, and we indeed intend to return and pass on the favors to others giving back to the community at our earliest chance.” Recruiting is one of the new unit’s top priorities at the moment, and it is looking for talented engineers who have a passion for programming. The new tech hub plans to employ 50 people during its first year, and possibly as many as 200 within a couple of years. “Hiring is never easy but the main reason we chose to set up operations in Helsinki is the huge talent pool here. We want to find the best engineers and offer them a great challenge and purpose while giving them the flexibility and freedom to individually decide how to find the best solutions,” Lamik remarks. Lamik says that Zalando chose Helsinki because of the engineering, user experience and design talent available here. Finland’s strong mobile sector and e-commerce friendly atmosphere were also important factors. “There is enormous potential in e-commerce software development here and no dominant player on the market yet. The startup community is strong, and we’re really looking forward to working together with it,” says Lamik. “We want to be a mentor, role model and partner to startups. Strong companies make a strong market and attract talented people. We intend to create innovative technical solutions, made in Finland.” “Hiring is never easy but the main reason we chose to set up operations in Helsinki is the huge talent pool here,” says Marc Lamik (in the middle), Zalando’s head of tech expansion."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/frenn-updates-men-s-wardrobe-for-the-modern-age/,FRENN updates men’s wardrobe for the modern age,"This pioneering Finnish fashion house is adapting to changes in daily working life. You may have heard that a Finn never sugar coats their opinion. If you want an honest appraisal of anything – and don’t mind the sting of reality – Finnish people will give you 100 per cent their truth. And then some! FRENN’s originality, corporate responsibility and design as a part of everyday life has been recognised. The Association for Finnish Work awarded the Helsinki-based producer of FRENN clothing for men with the 2017 Design Deed of the Year award. “Four years ago, we boldly set out to reinvent Finnish menswear, and our hard work is paying off,”   Jarkko Kallio. “Our sales network continues to expand in Finland and abroad.” In a world polluted by the white noise of political correctness this refreshing approach is very much at the core of men’s fashion designer  . “FRENN is being honest and real,” explains CEO  . “We are from Finland, but most of all from Helsinki and want to show the Helsinki spirit.” Such enthusiasm is woven into the fabric of a menswear range that draws on Finland’s capital for inspiration, from top to toe. “You have to tell where you are from,” enthuses  , the other half of the FRENN duo, himself responsible for the comfortable, casual and tailored designs. “Helsinki is a really interesting place on an international level. The spirit is different from Stockholm and Paris, for example. Here you think a little bit more what you would like yourself and how does it work for you. It is more individualist in that sense.” Yep, Finns tell it straight, all right. FRENN emerged in 2013, when Kallio and Laitinen decided the time was right to pool their many years of experience in textiles, PR and menswear. For them the Finnish design scene was lacking one crucial ingredient: young male designers bringing a fresh approach to menswear. Jarkko Kallio (left) and Antti Laitinen bring a fresh Finnish approach to menswear. But first, what exactly should they create? “We interviewed 20 guys who are not related to the fashion industry,” Laitinen recalls. “We asked them what they would like to have and got into the mindset of our potential customers.” The overwhelming theme that emerged during this process was the changing concept of work in the modern age. As office hours spent chained to a desk becomes less common, the line between work and play is frequently blurred. “Quite many wanted a relaxed way of dressing for the workday,” Kallio continues. “So that’s the idea that we want to offer: a perfect   for work and leisure. You feel comfortable and look good; not too business-like. We have been talking about relaxed tailoring.” Ensuring a good fit has been an integral part of their vision. Alterations are available for every one of their customers, both via FRENN’s online store and at their Liike boutique in Helsinki, shared with other Finnish design labels. The company name also reflects this approach, evolving from ‘Fresh Nordic Tailoring’ into ‘FRENN’. FRENN offers relaxed tailoring for work and leisure. Aside from tailored comfort and style, ethical production is another value that fits for FRENN. “Humanity, sustainability and personality are very important,” Kallio explains. “We wanted to start nearby with production in Estonia. We know where the products are made; we know the conditions.” Furthermore, quality fabrics are sourced from suppliers in Italy, Austria, Spain and Portugal, utilising organic and Öko-Tex Standard 100-certified materials as often as possible. Having already made quite a splash in Finland, this local offering is about to expand its range abroad. Sitting in the midst of their creative space on a Friday afternoon, with racks of clothes, rolls of fabric and piles of paperwork surrounding them, the duo is making final preparations for a month of attending fashion weeks in Berlin and Copenhagen. “We are opening the international market in Germany,” Kallio explains. “Our vision is to make Finnish menswear known abroad and take something new to the market.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/catchbox-gives-audiences-a-voice-like-never-before/,Catchbox gives audiences a voice like never before,"Catchbox puts an end to conference monologues: the microphone can be passed from one speaker to another simply by throwing it like a ball. The innovative yet simple invention has convinced not only customers, but also juries looking for award-winning design.  is so unique it might turn into a general term. If other throwable microphones come into existence, they could be called catchboxes, a bit like Scotch tape doesn’t only refer to tape made by Scotch. ”That’s what we’re going for. Time will tell,” says  , one of the three co-founders of Catchbox. Catchbox encourages listeners to participate more than a traditional mic. Catchbox is a microphone that a speaker or a presenter can throw to people in the audience. According to its makers, it also encourages listeners to participate more than a traditional mic. The core idea was to make the product as simple as they come. ”Perfection is when you’ve got nothing to add and nothing to take away,” CEO  points out. “When you throw a Catchbox at someone, they’ve only got a couple of seconds to figure out how it works. Hence the gadget can’t be too complicated.” The result has brought recognition: this year Catchbox received the international  , and Taanila was named the Young Designer of the Year in Finland. Although Taanila’s title is for him and not the company, according to the man himself Catchbox is his most special creation. “A fair few of our customers have told us they’ll never arrange another event without Catchbox. That goes to show we’ve done it right,” Taanila and Kauppila say. Taanila, Kauppila and  met at Aalto University’s Design Factory. They soon realised they all share the same ambition: creating and developing a completely unique product or service. Ideas were in abundance, and before coming up with Catchbox they were pondering over a mobile application that would’ve converted a smartphone into a mic. ”None of us knew any coding, but we were messing about with all sorts of stuff,” Taanila says laughingly. Pyry Taanila, the designer behind Catchbox, was named the Young Designer of the Year in Finland. The trio applied to the university’s Summer of Startups program with Catchbox in mind. Prototypes were stuffed into soft toy balls of all shapes and sizes. Although the feedback was mainly positive, there was room for criticism, too. Taanila now admits that their own faith in the idea’s business potential wasn’t always through the roof. When Catchbox was called the winner of the program, the internet went a little mad. ”Folks were tweeting and sharing our idea. In just a matter of days we got about 800 contacts from all over the world. That’s when we realised that this is something we needed to follow through on properly,” Taanila remembers. The story began in 2012, and the road hasn’t been without obstacles. In hindsight, Taanila says that had they known what was ahead, they wouldn’t have embarked on the journey at all. ”It’s a cliché for sure, but it’s true. It’s good we were young and naïve. It’s not like you get to create a whole new product segment every day.” The first prototypes were rented out to customers. Kauppila laughs whilst telling that the first one’s rent price was 50 euros, and he personally drove hundreds of kilometres to deliver it. ”That can’t be called a profitable business trip, but it was a big deal to realise someone was willing to pay for a Catchbox.” Soon the men decided that renting wasn’t the way to go. They started a crowdfunding campaign, and approximately 300 preorders came in. Now microphones are thrown in different corners of the world, including at events organised by Google and TED talks. The biggest customers are in Europe and the US, but in the near future the Catchbox team is hoping to knock on doors in Japan, Singapore, and South America from where they’ve already received inquiries. In addition to the three founders, Catchbox has nine employees, and the company also offers work to subcontractors and project workers. The headquarters are in Espoo, Finland, production and logistics are dealt with in Studers’ home country Latvia, and Boston, US will soon have its own sales office. Last year’s turnover was over 300 000 euros. According to Taanila, this year the sum will be three or even four times bigger. There are plans to expand the range of products. Now customers can already order a customised Catchbox featuring their own colours or logo, and this service is currently being developed further. Because of the increasingly rapid growth, Catchboxers are keeping their eyes peeled for new skills. Taanila describes the Catchbox team as innovative with full of ideas. ”In Finland it’s possible to create top-notch teams. The team is what in the end determines whether or not the idea really works out.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bros-gains-global-interest-with-playful-everyday-objects/,&Bros gains global interest with playful everyday objects,"Finland is home to growing number of young designers who refuse to bend to traditional molds or take ethical production for granted. With one foot strongly in international markets, Helsinki-based &Bros is one of them. Back in 2011,   and   met   and  while finishing their master’s degrees at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture. They were all wrestling with a very familiar question facing young designers: how to get visibility for their work and, preferably, even paying customers. This sparked the creation of  , a design company focused on the creation of modern everyday objects with a hint of playfulness. “What connects us is our desire to do and create something new,” says Kuivamäki. “We want to make durable products which have a way of brightening people’s lives.” Laser cutting techniques and cardboard come together in the Compleated lamp. Its lasercut plaits let light shine through creating a pearl necklace like pattern on the lamp. While &Bros specialises in everyday objects and textiles for the home, its collection covers everything from jewelry and pillowcases to furniture and even a quirky ‘Creatures from Finland’ memory game. The products have found resellers in design shops all over the world: “So far we haven’t had much time to do much marketing abroad, apart from visiting a few trade fairs,” Kuivamäki says. “The world is so global today and all sorts of photo sites, blogs and online stores bring [visibility]. That is how most of our foreign retailers have found us. They have seen pictures of our products somewhere, contacted us and started selling them.” Although &Bros targets global markets, advancing Finnish manufacturing and the design industry is core part of the company’s ideology: “We talked a lot about ecological and ethical design at Aalto University and they have become self-evident values for us,” explains Kuivamäki. “Like with our cardboard lamp, the material is easy to recycle and the lamp is manufactured locally.” The lamp to which Kuivamäki refers has been a highlight for &Bros. Called ‘Compleated’ the cardboard pendant lamp, which Kuivamäki has designed together with Silvennoinen, has become the company’s most popular product to date. Compleated has found its way to customers as far as in Australia and South Korea, and Finland’s prestigious Muoto2014 gala declared it ‘Light of the Year’. Today the lightweight lamp is available in several colours, sizes and in pendant, wall and table versions, but its inspiration came from humble beginnings: &Bros packaging for its first products, which were created from cardboard using laser cutting techniques. “We started to think cardboard is a wonderful material and it would be interesting to use it in other ways than just packaging,” Kuivamäki recalls. ”Almost by accident we noticed cardboard acts in a particular way when it’s cut, which became the core theme for the Compleated lamp. Lasercut plaits create a nice effect on the lamp as they let the light shine through and form a pearl necklace like pattern.” &Bros’ balance of global and local make the company a good example of Finland’s new generation of designers. They steer away from the traditional route of designing for others and instead towards producing their own designs: “I feel that Finnish design is on a fast track forward. There are many young designers and new ideas, and people are ready to challenge old structures,” Kuivamäki says. “At times I have felt design in Finland was somewhat submerged in old classics, but now there are lots of eager designers and positive energy to drive forward.” For &Bros the ideal situation would be to combine its design business with interdisciplinary art projects. A year ago the company held its first private exhibition containing unique works of art from its own designers. Now the exhibition is travelling to Stockholm, where it will be showcased at the Finnish Institute in November. “Of course we want to grow the company and, at least for me personally, it would be wonderful to employ more people,” Kivimäki explains. “But it would be great to also continue [our artistic projects], to have both art and design side-by-side in our operations.” &Bros’ collection covers everything from jewelry and pillowcases to furniture and even a quirky ‘Creatures from Finland’ memory game (pictured)."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-young-designers-of-the-future/,Finland’s young designers of the future,"The Habitare fair currently ongoing in Helsinki showcases current design and interior decoration trends. Good News from Finland spoke to some young designers at the fair – these are the names to follow in the future.   and   met a few years ago in a class at Aalto University’s School of Arts, Design and Architecture. Alanko was studying fashion design while Yoshizawa’s area of study was textile design. The friendship that began in that class blossomed and was given an added dimension last winter: the friends established the textile design collective  . The pair designs textiles that they sell to, for example, interior design and fashion companies. Although just a fledgling company, A-finity Patterns has had its share of customers – so far mainly in Finland but they intend to head abroad. “We are taking our new collection to Sweden and next spring we will participate in a design industry fair in Germany,” says Alanko. “Our base will remain in Finland but we need to go overseas because the domestic markets here are very small.” Yoshizawa completed her Bachelor’s degree in Norway from where she came to the School of Arts, Design and Architecture in Finland as an exchange student. The school impressed her enough to convince her to study there for her Master’s degree. Despite the small markets, Finland is a good place for designers in Yoshizawa’s opinion: “I think Finnish people are open to design and readily accept new ideas. It’s easy to call attention to your work and get your voice heard in a small country,” Yoshizawa says. Aino Michelsen is specialised in furniture design, which includes also interior design products such as the flower pots featured above. Alanko and Yoshizawa are inspired in their design work by the world around them and by everyday life. The furniture designer   concurs with this approach. Her collection at the Habitare fair features a strong Vietnamese influence, as a result of her internship in the country. “I believe that design is inspired by the environment that you find yourself in. Different materials are also close to my heart: when I find an interesting material I use it as a starting point for creating something new.” Michelsen is a graduate of the Lahti Institute of Design and Fine Art. This autumn she will be starting her Master’s studies in furniture design in Copenhagen. In future, Michelsen hopes to work in an international environment. Before this happens, however, she has something to say about the current trends in Finnish design: “Many colours and materials have surfaced alongside black and white. A playfulness has begun to appear in shapes, which I’m very happy about.” ’s career as a designer has included spatial and product design, as well as exhibition architecture. Her educational background is also broad. Anonen studied industrial design at the Lahti Institute of Design and Fine Art, completed her Master’s degree at Aalto University’s School of Arts, Design and Architecture and holds a degree in artisan carpentry. “The visual world, materials and colours have always interested me, as has working with my hands. My degree in artisan carpentry supports my profession as a designer: I can use my know-how in a variety of design projects,” says Anonen. Currently Anonen’s work is focused on spatial design. In future, her new company will be keeping her busy. “As a student I worked for others but now I’m starting my own business,” she says. “In the future, I plan to work within my chosen field through my own company and master new things in the process. There is a lot to learn in the world of design because new materials and techniques keep arriving on the scene.” Hanna Anonen’s exhibition at Habitare included a variety of spatial design elements."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/telling-stories-is-the-game-plan-for-rival-games/,Telling stories is the game plan for Rival Games,"The city of Turku may seem peaceful and pristine on the surface, but darker tales are emerging from Finland’s former capital, enjoyed by gamers around the world. For many, becoming CEO of a company is the top of the hill, the icing on the cake, the cherry on top and a hundred other metaphors. For  , CEO of game studio  , his official title has come to represent something else: Chief Eating Officer. “In startups the titles don’t mean squat,” he explains with a chuckle. “As founders, here in the office we try to take care of people and make sure they have coffee, things to eat etc. They do all the hard labour. The title references that.” Nonetheless, the acronym remains practical for more formal purposes. “Of course, especially when foreign investors want to talk to the CEO, there is still the CEO title,” he states. Rival Games was established in Turku two years ago, after Laakso and his cofounders saw an opportunity to redefine interactive storytelling with videogames. “Stories are the oldest form of entertainment,” he says. “TV and movies have been doing well on that front, but if we look at games, especially on PC and mobile, they tend to remind us of the ‘80s where the plot is just a fill for different locations. To put it frankly, we want to be what HBO is in TV entertainment.”  is the first step towards this lofty goal. Taking inspiration from television series such as  , its narrative has been broken into episodes, the second of which was recently released. Based on an original idea from Laakso, gamers are transported to a graphic novel milieu, as the murder- and interrogation-filled tale of a veteran detective and a former informant plays out on the dark streets of a crime-ridden metropolis. Taking inspiration from television series such as The Wire, The Detail’s narrative has been broken into episodes, the second of which was recently released. However, if you take a stroll around Finland’s former capital city, you’d be hard pressed to stumble across any suggestion of the noir grittiness that infuses  . So, what gives? “The American setting was a business choice,” Laakso explains. “Even though the Nordics are interesting, they don’t sell that well with games, so we decided to set it in a more familiar territory. There’s still some resonances from the Nordics, but it’s set in the States.” A wise choice: sales have been strong worldwide and critical applause has been boisterous. “Most reviewers and players have enjoyed it,” Laakso humbly confirms. “Of course, if you hate noir, and crime noir especially, then you’re not going to like it; it’s not the right game for you then.” Those few whose cup of tea   surely isn’t needn’t fret; there are exciting plans afoot for Rival Games in the near future. “We’ve got something extremely cool coming up,” Laakso enthuses. A game is in the pipeline based on a well-known comic strip. “We partnered up with a big player from the United States for exclusivity on a IPF over there. It is kind of a dream come true.” And so, as they seek out another capital boost to fuel such expansive endeavours, one wonders if the company will eventually outgrow the confines of Finland’s fifth-largest city and shift to a larger locale. Somewhere Stateside perhaps? “No, we enjoy being here,” Laakso admits, matter-of-factly. “There’s no need to be abroad. It just means when I get home from the office, I usually have a Skype call in the evening due to time zone differences. It’s not a big issue.” Rival Games wants to redefine interactive storytelling with videogames."

Good News from Finland put together a list of interesting innovations from young designers who are still looking for someone to commercialise some of their ideas.    is very pleased. Her Bibi mirror, which is, above all, designed with convenience in mind, has been well received. The mirror, which is easy and cheap to manufacture industrially is waiting to find a manufacturer. “The rubber handle of the mirror is incorporated into the mirror’s surface, which makes it unnecessary to shape or attach a separate handle. The friction of the rubber enables the mirror to stand upright and the rubber section also protects the hole from which the mirror can be hung on a wall,” Poskiparta says. Poskiparta, studying for her Master’s degree at Aalto University, was surprised by the attention her creation has received from the foreign media visiting the fair. “The foreign media immediately grasped the idea behind the mirror. I didn’t need to explain that the colour isn’t paint but rubber and that it has a function,” she says. Poskiparta appears to have a clear vision of what young designers should be doing differently: “Young people should courageously apply overseas for internships or jobs at the studios and companies they admire. This would make it easier to work together with foreign firms, which is essential in our field. We need to learn from the best in order to take our design potential to the max.” Poskiparta also hopes to see consumer habits change. High-quality and sustainable products created in Finland and elsewhere in Europe should be valued more instead of people chasing the latest trends. “We should be more far-sighted in our purchases. We shouldn’t succumb to trends but find our unique styles. Arabia’s tableware, for example, doesn’t age – future generations value it just as much. It is tied in with family,” she says. Laura Väre wishes to improve people’s daily lives through design. Pictured is Väre’s chair with three backrests. Designer   has brought to Habitare a lamp that she has designed, which already has a reseller, a clothes rack constructed out of a broomstick and a chair with three backrests. Väre wishes to improve people’s daily lives through design. She is inspired by small, everyday chores and walking around the city and in nature. Her furniture is defined by simple forms and functionality. Väre, studying for her Master’s degree at Aalto University, considers functionality and beauty to be key aspects of furniture, as is the bond that develops between an object and its owner: “It is important that a product is liked – it guarantees its longevity,” says Väre. “Can I touch that?” curious fair visitors ask. They are interested in the metres-long bolts of cloth that feature broad brush strokes and abstract designs.  is a new-generation designer whose prints are inspired by Finnish forests, shorelines and natural diversity. Laurikainen wishes to bring the beauty and joy of the everyday into peoples’ homes through her designs. “As a designer of prints I interpret the world, phenomena and details in my unique manner. I want to leave a certain abstractness in the prints and I like to play with the fine line between the figurative and the abstract in a way that leaves room for the viewer’s imagination.” Laurikainen, still a student at Turku University of Applied Sciences, hopes to see Finnish design reinvent itself: “It would be great to see some surprises! And daring – for everyone to step away from the old.” Hanna Laurikainen’s prints are inspired by Finnish forests, shorelines and natural diversity."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nanomaji-tackles-environmental-problems/,Nanomaji tackles environmental problems,"If you would think of a device that is able to tackle air pollution, deforestation and a lack of clean drinking water at the same time, which one would it be? If you ask a group of students at Aalto University, the answer is: a water filter. Ordinary water filters are, however, not a solution to three of the world’s gravest environmental and societal problems, but there exists a special filter capable of doing this:  . The name might sound Japanese to some but it is actually made of the words of ‘nano’, derived from the nanomaterial used in the filter, and ‘maji’, the Swahili word for water. Nanomaji was designed for developing markets where it is not the only proposed filter solution. The crucial difference that sets it apart from other products is that instead of membrane, the filter uses nanomaterial. No additional resources or devices are necessary to push the water through the filter. All that is needed is gravity. Nanomaji was born in a school project at Aalto University in cooperation with the Finnish company Ahlstrom, which provided the material and challenged the 11 students to come up with a product for developing markets. Nanomaji contains nanomaterial instead of membrane hence gravity is enough to filter the water. Pictured is the Nanomaji water filter attached to a jerry can. The team members hail from Finland, Brazil, Latvia, Taiwan, China and Mexico and they study in a variety of different fields such as design, chemistry, environmental engineering and sustainable business. The diversity and the size of the team have proved to be an asset rather than a disadvantage. “We have some really creative people that can just come up with crazy ideas and then we have some who can implement those crazy ideas. That’s why we had no major difficulties,” says  . The inspiration for the filter came from filter systems used in hiking. However, the existing water filter systems are not compatible with the everyday lives of the people in developing countries where often a jerry can is used to store water. To find out more, the students went to Tanzania where they brainstormed with the locals to design a water filter that fits their needs and lifestyle the best. In Tanzania and other developing countries, water must be boiled before it can be consumed and burning charcoal is the most common way to do it. This has resulted in severe air pollution and deforestation. Nanomaji is supposed to alleviate the environmental consequences by rendering boiling water redundant. The filter is small and versatile and can be attached to jerry cans and to big water tanks alike. It is also cheaper for the users: families in Tanzania spend currently 2.5 euros per week on charcoal while a Nanomaji filter costs only 1.6 euros per week and lasts a month. The price gap is likely to widen in the future due to the anticipated increase in the price of charcoal. A lack of attention is certainly nothing the students need to be afraid of. They prevailed in the Finnish round of the   competition which they saw as an opportunity to promote their invention. Some investors have already expressed interest in the product and also within Ahlstrom the product has been met with benevolent curiosity. Now the school project is slated to transform into a promising cleantech company. Eight of the former group members are still on board and the tasks for the next months are research and improving the filter’s design. Nanomaji’s makers are already eyeing the future that lies ahead. Tanzania is the stepping stone that will keep the team busy for the next years but its neighbouring countries are already in sight. The design of the water filter is the result of intensive brainstorming sessions with the locals in Tanzania."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/could-finland-become-the-silicon-valley-of-industrial-internet/,Could Finland become the Silicon Valley of Industrial Internet?,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is often used as a much hype term, but it offers great opportunities to businesses and societies alike. In Finland alone, it is predicted to bring billions of euros in investments and tens of thousands of jobs and the country is already putting its tech savviness into work.  Picture the scene. A waste container is starting to get scaringly close to overflowing, but with perfect timing a garbage truck arrives and empties it. A small sensor device inside the bin makes sure the waste management company knows the actual fill-level and the accompanying web service automatically optimises collection routes based on full containers, traffic etc. The company also sees in real-time where trucks are moving and how much material they are transporting. This isn’t science fiction. It is all based on the intelligent waste management system developed by Finnish IIoT company   and it serves as an excellent example of the Industrial Internet at its best: new innovative business models based on data collected by smart, network connected devices. “The price of components, network connections and technology have arrived at the point where connections can be built even into garbage bins,” says  , CEO of Enevo. “However, data collection is only one part of it. The main thing is how that data is used to get information which helps [people or software] in decisionmaking…and benefits the process as a.” Enevo claims the information it creates can help waste management companies to cut their collection cost by up to 50 per cent as less collection hours and mileage are needed. This also reduces emissions and improves service quality. Enevo was only founded in 2010, but its innovative approach to a traditional process has already seen it secure   and customers in 35 countries. And Enevo’s success has been mirrored by many others.  , commissioned by the Finnish government, IIoT business activities could bring 12 billion euros in investments and 48 000 jobs to Finland by 2023. Not a bad incentive. Finland may have a population of just 5.5 million, but it has all the right ingredients to be a leading player in the Industrial Internet revolution. The country’s famously advanced digital infrastructure grabs headlines, but its strengths in electronics and data security are also combining with its expertise in many traditional industries to transform them for a new age: At the core of Enevo’s waste management system is a small sensor which attaches to a waste container and automatically informs waste management companies of their fill-levels. Pictured is Enevo’s CEO Fredrik Kekäläinen. “Among others health tech, forestry machinery and shipbuilding are hubs of Finnish [industrial] expertise, where we have a strong lead over many countries,” explains  , director at the  . “Finland also has exceptionally strong expertise in data security, which has a central role in the Industrial Internet. No other country of similar size has over hundred data security companies [Finland has almost 200].” These strong foundations have already been put in use by many established industrial players to seize the potential competitive advantages of IIoT. Forest machinery company Ponsse has done it by making logging high tech. From the middle of the forests its harvesters automatically and wirelessly send data on their maintenance needs and the logging process to a web service. This can be accessed anywhere with a mobile app. Furthemore clients can be notified of the amounts and types of wood heading their way from the forests in real-time. Among Finnish forerunners in IIoT is also Kemppi. The welding equipment manufacturer has developed a system which brings all data and documentation related to welding into a cloud-based web service. Welding processes can be monitored in real-time even from the other side of the world. This makes the whole process more efficient and reduces the risk of mistakes. However forerunner companies are just the beginning for the disruptive force which is the Industrial Internet. To reach the impressive forecasts in VTT’s report, both companies and the public sector must actively advance the Industrial Internet and take a key role in developing universal platforms and ecosystems for it — not just in Finland, but internationally. This is the mission of the Finnish Industrial Internet Forum (FIIF) which aims to increase cooperation between companies, research organisations and public actors in different industries. “We talk about value production for the end customer which lasts the whole lifecycle [of a product/service] and where all components of a value chain – subcontractors, logistics services, everything imaginable – are part of one Industrial Internet ecosystem,” Viitasaari says. Enevo is starting to embody this message. The company’s goal is to have the Enevo waste system running in all major cities in all industrialised countries, but at the same time it is looking at new ways to implement its expertise. It already has pilot schemes for management of septic tanks and fuel distribution systems. “If we would have been thinking traditionally, we would have started to sell the sensors and never tapped into the data side,” Kekäläinen says. “Technology know-how is really strong in Finland, but we need more courage to go abroad and say we are the best.” “The price of sensors has gone down so much that they can be used with any industrial devices and processes,” says Jukka Viitasaari. “Industrial devices can be Aker Yard’s huge ships, Konecranes’ cranes, Wärtsilä’s diesel engines, Neste Oil’s harbour logistics, Raute’s forklifts… They are everywhere.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/quuppa-keeps-track-of-the-market/,Quuppa keeps track of the market,"Much has been made about the declining fortunes of Nokia. Yet, the flip side sees former employees now bringing their innovative ideas directly to the market themselves, such as this intelligent locating system. Here’s the typical startup plan: first come up with a groundbreaking idea, something that will alter the landscape in its particular sector. Next, do exhaustive research and develop prototypes, fine-tuning the business plan at every turn until it is perfect. Finally, once all boxes have been ticked, take your first tentative steps towards the marketplace. Now, imagine if the lion’s share of this process was already completed by the time you establish your company. This is the   story. These technology providers developed their intelligent locating system for eight years whilst employed at Nokia, eventually taking a working prototype with them after being made redundant in 2012. “It is a one-size-fits-all platform in a way,” explains chief customer officer  , comparing the technology to a car engine, upon which value can be built. “If you have a good engine you can tweak it just by changing parameters, without changing the hardware. This is pretty much what our product is.” Quuppa’s customer base has grown rapidly to around 100 companies worldwide since launching in 2013, each finding their own particular use for the tracking technology. Testament to this, Quuppa’s webpage is filled with numerous explanatory videos, many of them sports-related. Quuppa solution can track the location and movement of any object with sub-meter accuracy, in real-time. “Sport is definitely a hot one for us, simply because it is fun,” Belloni enthuses. “You also have the quickest speed of execution.” With a click of the mouse an ice hockey video demonstrates the system’s appeal. Coloured dots buzz around the rink representing players, referees and the puck. A handful of strategically placed locators track all movements on the ice with a 100-to-150-millisecond delay via easily attached 18 x 18 mm tags. Biometric data is also fed from heart rate monitors worn by the players, combining with the positioning data to cover all statistical angles. Amidst the impressive spectacle, Belloni is quick to emphasise that sport is only one of the many sectors Quuppa has a presence in. “The reason why we talk about sport a lot is because we like it and people relate to it very easily,” he says. “It’s a tough environment – if you do it in sport, you can do it in retail.” Case in point, Belloni clicks open a video detailing how its technology can track customers via shopping baskets and trolleys. Storeowners thus determine their most popular aisles, and shelf space can be sold here at a premium. Furthermore, real time advertisements open a range of possibilities, and incorporating the Internet of Things can also monitor the likes of refrigeration temperature. Another emerging sector for Quuppa is hospitals, facilitating better service by monitoring staff, patients and equipment, and ensuring regulatory compliance. First up, the Quuppa system is being installed in a 1.7 million-square foot hospital in the USA. “The pilot was supposed to last one month – it lasted 48 hours,” Belloni states. “The customer bought it on the spot.” This sizable project reflects Quuppa’s growing business Stateside. The company is doubling their number of global partners after signing their first distributor agreement with a significant American corporation. Other big changes are afoot. “One of our targets before the end of the year is to open an office in the US,” Belloni explains, pointing to the frequency they visit America. “I became a platinum member of Finnair in six months after we started Quuppa.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/recruitby-net-brings-a-boost-to-recruitment-business/,Recruitby.net brings a boost to recruitment business,"A big pile of great applications is a challenge for any recruiter. Interviewing everyone would be costly and take time, but all interesting applicants deserve a shot. Recruitby.net provides the market with a solution that benefits both job-seekers and recruiters. Five years ago a group of professional recruiters started to ponder over what technology had done to smoothen recruitment processes. “In finding a new employee, conducting interviews is the most labour-intensive and time-consuming phase. It turned out technology had done nothing about it,” says  , the CEO of  . The idea of arranging the first round of interviews with the help of video recordings was born in the recruitment industry. Because the development of such a tool isn’t in the core of recruiters’ expertise, Recruitby.net was founded. According to Beilinson, Recruitby.net steps in between sending cover letters and resumes and arranging actual interviews. The recruiter can choose a relatively large bunch of potential applicants and send out invitations to participate in a video interview. Then the participants respond to pre-recorded questions before a deadline, and the recruiter can then watch the videos at a suitable time. That way both parties avoid finding slots in their calendars, and the applicant doesn’t need to travel anywhere. “For example, the job applicant can reside in a different time zone. With recorded videos that’s no issue,” Beilinson points out. On the basis of recorded interviews, the recruiter can choose whom to invite to a face-to-face interview. This can be arranged digitally, too; Recruitby.net’s customers asked for a tool for live online interviews, and the company delivered. The product was launched in 2012 after doing intense research. ”A fair few of interviewers still haven’t even heard of video interviews. We don’t focus on competing with other software, but rather just increasing awareness and usage,” says Recruitby.net’s CEO Ari Beilinson (pictured left). ”People were sat next to recruiters’ desks and following them everywhere. Then they tried compressing all possible stages of the process into the online tool,” Beilinson describes. At first the development team consisted of contractors, and Recruitby.net had one employee. The company has been growing rapidly throughout its existence, and its annual turnover increase has been over 50 per cent. Currently Recruitby.net has about a dozen employees, and it’s got several country partners that are in charge of sales in their own area. The company has representatives in six European countries, Latin America, and United Arab Emirates. In addition to English, the service is available in Finnish, German, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Swedish, and Danish. Beilinson says that the selection of languages will be expanded when new markets open up. Now the Nordic countries are notable leaders, and they’re followed by English-speaking areas. ”There are evident cultural differences as to how the method is adapted. For example, in Italy the so called digital divide is much wider in comparison to Finland; in other words, in Finland people tend to be more accustomed to using a computer,” Beilinson mentions. Recruitby.net isn’t the only one of its kind. However, according to Beilinson the company’s main competitors aren’t other providers of similar services, but traditional interviewing methods. ”A fair few of interviewers still haven’t even heard of video interviews. We don’t focus on competing with other software, but rather just increasing awareness and usage.” According to a survey conducted by Recruitby.net a lot of recruiters believe video interviews will become more and more popular in the future. That means job-seekers will need to learn new ways of standing out in the crowd. For some a video interview can be even easier than a face-to-face interview, because the responses can be re-recorded and sent only when the applicant is happy with them. Is it possible that an applicant performs well on the video and seems fluent even answering questions in foreign languages, but turns out completely different in a live interview? “I haven’t heard of anyone being brilliant on the video and then really nervous face-to-face. Videos tend to give a relatively accurate image. Many candidates like making the videos, because they offer a better opportunity for presenting themselves than a written cover letter.” Despite the current financial climate and redundancies, Recruitby.net believes that employees will be looked for in the future. Hence tools for making recruitment easier are needed as well. “If we were experiencing a financial upturn and high employment rates, obviously our growth would get faster. Even so, time is working on our behalf. There was a time when companies didn’t use email, and now everyone’s got it.” Recruitby.net’s concept is simple: the interviewees respond to pre-recorded questions and the recruiter can watch the videos afterwards at a suitable time."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/black-eye-market-comes-into-focus/,Black Eye comes into focus,"This range of attachable lenses is rapidly expanding the perspective of smartphone cameras. Some bemoan the relentless advance of technology: public transport commutes crowded with people hunched over their smartphone display, favouring texting instead of calling or utilising online services instead of in person. Whatever your take on the man vs. technology debate, one community that won’t be complaining anytime soon is the extreme sports scene. For years proponents of such have skilfully negotiated their boards and bikes over a range of inanimate objects, eagerly pursued by friends lugging heavy equipment in order to capture every move on VHS tape and 35 mm film. Fast-forward to now and such technology fits comfortably into their pockets, with smartphones capturing 4K video and 40-plus megapixel images with ease. “As a photographer myself I have always been looking for new things,”   CEO  explains. “When the phone started being so good that you could actually use them as photographing devices I started thinking of the possibility with lenses to use for different sports.” After some time studying the market Ekman and his co-founders climbed through a window of opportunity in mid-2013. “I saw a lot of things that could be fixed,” he recalls. “When we decided to establish Black Eye there were only a couple of products around, but nothing that big or well branded.” So, first things first: they would need a name. The rule-of-thumb for companies when coming up with a suitable moniker is to utilise clever wordplay that evokes customer affiliation with brand identity. The self-financed Black Eye thus drew on the misfortune of co-founder and pro-snowboarder  . After a nasty spill on the slopes, rather than swear off snowboarding for the immediate future, Ettala, along with Ekman and their third co-founder  saw the dark ring under his left eye as a perfect fit for the company name. Black Eye got its name after its co-founder Eero Ettala’s nasty spill on the slopes: the dark ring under Eettala’s left eye was a perfect fit for the company name. With the title decided upon, initially the vastness of untapped potential in the smartphone camera market found the budding business taking a moment to find its focus. “When we started we didn’t really have an idea what we were going for,” Ekman recalls, pointing to their initial line of power banks for phones that was eventually discontinued so they could focus solely on lenses. The ever-evolving nature of smartphone innovations would keep them amply busy, with new accessories such as the selfie stick presenting specific challenges to accommodating their lenses. “We had to look how we can make a product adaptable for that kind of use,” Ekman explains. “We have to follow the trends. If there comes a new app, there is different kind of system needed to take the photograph.” Black Eye’s portfolio of lens-related products keeps growing, with eight different models currently on offer. When asked what makes the company stand out in an increasingly crowded marketplace, Ekman points to the easy-to-manage screw-on, clip-on and magnetic attachment systems, as well as the quality of lenses. Proof of this, the Black Eye website is brimming with snaps taken around the world, with their fish-eye, wide angle and macro lenses offering innovative perspectives on boarding, biking and travelling. Rubbing shoulders with celebrities is also not out of the question, with Finnish stunt quartet The Dudesons, rocker  and even   among the famous faces captured online. “Black Eye opens a lot of new ways for photographing with your phone,” Ekman proclaims. “We are taking photography to the next level. The sky’s the limit.” “Black Eye opens a lot of new ways for photographing with your phone,” Black Eye CEO Arto Ekman proclaims. “We are taking photography to the next level.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/swedish-property-software-specialist-incit-expands-to-finland/,Swedish property software specialist Incit expands to Finland,"Swedish real estate software developer Incit AB is strengthening its Nordic reach with a new office in Finnish capital Helsinki.  has been providing consultancy and software systems for the Swedish property industry since the late 1960s. After expansions to Norway and the Netherlands, the company decided it was time to bring its property business expertise to the neighbouring Finland. Incit opened its first office in Helsinki in early September. “When you are planning to establish abroad, you study the potential markets and get a feeling which are easiest to access in terms of culture and, in our case, housing culture and legislation,” says  , senior consultant at Incit and manager of the Finnish branch. “Finland is very similar to Sweden so it was an easy step to take… Also Finland is a very modern country and has a good reputation in Sweden in terms of technology and innovation.” The new branch office is in charge of Incit’s operations across Finland. Its main focus is to introduce the company’s proprietary ‘Incit Xpand’ property management software to local customers and to offer support in implementation and training. It will also work with Incit’s other locations offering consultancy services. Currently the Helsinki branch employs two people with plans to hire two more consultants in the near future and to grow to ten or more as it becomes more established in the country. In total Incit employs over 100 people in four countries, of which 75 are located in Sweden. “We originally built the software to be used internationally which makes it very easy to adopt and implement in different countries,” explains Oscar Gyllensten, Senior Consultant at Incit and manager of the Finnish branch. Although Incit started as a consultancy company, and still has a strong consulting arm focusing on services including maintenance and energy efficiency plans, software has gradually become its primary business. The company has been quick to react to technological developments, creating its first property management system back in late the 1980s. Today that system has evolved into Incit Xpand and expanded to cover all aspects of real estate: management, operations, maintenance and finance. In addition to an early start, the software’s key strengths are its international reach and flexibility: “We originally built the software to be used internationally which makes it very easy to adopt and implement in different countries,” Gyllensten explains. “The software is separated into different modules but they are all part of the same package. Our customers do not need any additional integration since everything comes in one package and licences are used to manage what access you have to the different parts of the system.” Incit explains this makes the software flexible, easy to manage and also cost-efficient since modules can be added without new installations or integrations. It also scales to the needs of major corporations with hundreds of thousands of rental agreements. The software has already been translated to Finnish and the Helsinki office is working on the finishing touches to adapt it to the local regulatory environments. While part of Finland’s attraction to Incit was its technology-savviness and cultural similarities to Sweden, a major factor was the interest the country showed in its software: “We conducted market studies with Finnish organisations, such as Invest in Finland [a government agency promoting foreign investment],” Gyllensten says. “We also did some customer demonstrations and saw there was huge demand for our products here.” Now this interest is turning into discussions with potential customers and Incit believes it will soon be working with property companies across the country. The Finnish expansion also suits the internationalisation plans of Incit’s mother company, Germany-based Aareon Group, which bought the Swedish company in 2012. Aareon specialises in property industry digitisation and employs over 1,200 people across seven countries. “Our new owners have an aggressive internationalisation strategy and they are planning to expand to many more countries in Western and Northern Europe,” Gyllensten reveals. 
All of which makes the new Helsinki office an important part of Incit’s boarder international plan. Incit employs a total of over 100 people in Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and now Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ookoohko-cleans-up-in-the-mobile-gaming-world/,Ookoohko cleans up in the mobile gaming world,"Independence is the name of the game for this trio of Finnish games designers, not just in their approach, but geographically too. Inspiration, it seems, can come from anywhere. For  , one-third of independent game studio  , a rush of enthusiasm happened to befall him whilst drifting off to sleep one night on a ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki. Whilst many other passengers were busying themselves with the various distractions available on board, Laakso was squirreled away in his cabin, conjuring up a great idea for the studio’s next game:  . “I thought we could make a quick game where you are a ‘zero tolerance hero’,” he recalls, with a smile. “It’s a side scroller and you play a cranky superhero who is tired of all the urban annoyance and sets out to clean up his town of graffiti. I thought this is a great idea, six months tops we’re done. Four years later we are almost there.” There have been some sizeable obstacles in the path towards completion in a timely fashion – namely the fact that Laakso, along with cofounders  and  , all have fulltime day jobs. Not to mention they are also based in three separate cities: Helsinki, Tampere and Stockholm. The three friends were no strangers to the industry in 2009 when they set out to make mobile games together under the Ookoohko moniker, having previously co-founded games studio Sumea before Digital Chocolate acquired it in 2004. After working on dozens of titles on various platforms in the interim, they sought to consolidate their considerable experience once again. The Ookoohko trio of (left to right) Toni Laakso, Sami Arola and Jarkko Salminen has been involved in the gaming industry for many years. “We try to make fun and high quality games,” Laakso explains. “We are small and fiercely independent. We’ve worked at bigger companies before, and from the get-go we didn’t want to take some outside money. We do things our way.” This independent streak was also seen in the name they chose for their enterprise. So, yeah, what exactly does it mean? “  is Finnish, for okay,” Laakso explains. “And the suffix ‘  means ‘ish’. So the name translates to ‘okay-ish’. Some self-irony. There are companies in Finnish that call themselves   [great] and   [righteous] – all those words. We wanted to set the bar: okay-ish. [laughs] Actually, it’s not exactly true. It turns out we are three perfectionists.” The first release from the trio arrived in the shape of   in 2011. Needles to say, it was well received.   described it as “a fantastic little game that not only looks great, but also is a lot of fun”. Certainly, its tale of an extra terrestrial whose deserted home planet paradise is disrupted by a “particularly lively variety of alien annoyance called ‘wikus’”, couldn’t help but raise smiles around the world. Buoyed by their success, their long-awaited follow-up is  . After a enjoying a soft release in the Nordic countries and New Zealand, it is soon to be unleashed upon the global audience. Aimed at young adults with a sense of humour, the game is a throwback to the classic ‘80s arcade players. Laakso is quick to point out that the Ookoohko trio themselves aren’t tolerance averse. In fact, given the opportunity, they would each spend much more time on the streets they have created. “If this game hits the right spot, and everything aligns accordingly, I would like nothing more than to make this a fulltime gig,” Laakso admits. “It would be a dream.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/moppi-disrupts-the-cleaning-business/,Moppi disrupts the cleaning business,"The cleaning business has not changed in decades. The Finnish startup Moppi has made it its mission to turn the conventional markets for home cleaning services upside down. Last winter,   wanted to start a new business. Just in what sector and where to begin? When he went to his former business partner  , the two friends quickly identified the cleaning business as a field that is in dire need of change. After several months of planning and product development, the company Moppi was born in June.  is an online platform that eases the entire process of home cleaning. Finding an appropriate cleaner, agreeing on a date and time and paying the bill take a mere two minutes. “We wanted to create a market place for professional cleaners so that they can find customers, do the bookings and really focus on the cleaning,” Tiainen says. “As a cleaner you should be cleaning instead of running your own company where you have to do accounting, invoicing or customer acquisition. Our customers benefit from this as well.” Moppi prepares for a fast international expansion from its office in downtown Helsinki. The makers of Moppi found it surprising that nobody had yet lifted the cleaning business to 21st century standards, even though home cleaning services are frequently used and subsidised by governments in many countries. “Our generation, the younger generation, is used to buying services and products from online market places,” Tiainen muses. Much like other service platforms such as Uber, Moppi features a rating system with which the customers can express how happy they are with the services they bought. In case a customer is unhappy, the cleaner will clean again free of charge. “It is all about how satisfied the customers are. There shouldn’t be bad experiences with cleaning services,” says Tiainen. The company’s advantage is that with its platform it eliminates the need for the traditional middle management of a company that absorbs a considerable amount of resources. As a result, cleaners earn around 25 per cent more than their peers in a traditional cleaning company while the customers pay significantly less. Moppi works within the existing legislative framework and controversies that have engulfed companies such as Uber are unlikely to occur. The company’s team conducts background checks on all cleaners to make sure they are professionals; an insurance up to one million euros is valid for every service booked through the platform. Furthermore, all taxes and insurance contributions are paid. Operating only in Finland was never an option. The company’s ambitious plans aim at a brisk international expansion starting in the coming spring in Sweden, followed by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Currently the company is running a new seed funding round to buttress their expansion into these new markets. A joint project with Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, for further development of the platform and the services is also on the cards. “We have two service and product launches around the beginning of next year. It will be something this industry has never seen before,” hints Tiainen. The entrepreneurs speak favourably of the means available in Finland to scale up and expand internationally. “There is nothing like Tekes in Sweden where I am from. In Sweden you will not get any funding if you are not part of a selected group,” says  , CFO of Moppi. “We do not have a large domestic market to pull anything big so everybody is going international,” Tiainen states. “I have done business internationally and in terms of government incentives and support to go international, there is no better system than ours,” he concludes. 35 cleaners are currently working for Moppi. By the end of next year, the company wants to increase that number to 250."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/touchpoint-makes-modern-work-wear-with-recycled-materials/,Touchpoint makes modern work wear with recycled materials,"Red bricks as far as the eye can reach. That could be the slogan of the modern event venue Teurastamo where the Finnish design company Touchpoint decided to launch its latest work wear collection Rafla. Work wear for restaurant staff is nothing new for Touchpoint. The designers have plenty of experience in producing work wear collections for companies such as Finnish fast-food giant Hesburger and British cosmetics chain The Body Shop. With Rafla, the Finnish designers are testing new waters by offering a fashion line made from recycled materials available for each and every restaurant, hotel or other service sector business. “We do not see any exciting work wear clothing anywhere. In general, what you can find is quite boring,” says  , director of sales and marketing at  . “We created a collection that is really fancy and sustainable. What we did is putting together the fashion world and ecological materials and that is something totally new in entire Scandinavia.” “It is very important that you are looking and feeling good because we are keeping our clothes on 15 hours per day, six days a week.,” says  , master chef and kitchen manager at the renowned Savoy restaurant in Helsinki. “I always thought that chefs have to feel good in their uniforms. If you are feeling bad in your clothes you cannot give your best in the kitchen.” Touchpoint has launched the Rafla collection in the old factory house of Teurastamo in Helsinki. As a member of the Rafla team, Aihinen has provided invaluable feedback and information to   and  , the designers of the Rafla collection. “We took the functional aspects into consideration. The visual inspiration came from street wear and current fashion trends. We tried to keep it as ‘street smart’ as possible”, adds Piia Emilia, who won the Young Designer of the Year Award in 2014. The feedback provided by professionals taught the designers that chefs are generally satisfied with their uniforms but that additional elements of functionality, such as deep pockets, are a welcome asset. To make the Rafla work wear viable for restaurant purposes, the clothes are made of denim-lookalike materials that easily withstand being washed at 95 degrees. There is certainly something to Touchpoint’s event in the industrial ambience of Teurastamo, an old abattoir turned into a cultural and business venue. The old factory flair combined with dim light and the generous use of smoke machines creates an atmosphere akin to the finest steampunk fantasies of science fiction fans. Just that there are no steam engines and people with gas masks but two dozen young models wearing Touchpoint’s newest piece of work wear. Towards the end they dance to a somewhat unorthodox music mix of Metallica and Wham. As the event unfolds into the after-show mingling, the audience seems pleased and Peltonen and her team are visibly happy to finally reap the fruits of their labour almost a year after they started working on the project. So, what’s next? The successful cooperation with The Body Shop is set to continue and Sweden and the United Kingdom are next on Touchpoint’s bucket list. New international clients interested in trendy work wear for their employees are aplenty and while Peltonen states that the names are still a secret until the deals are sealed, the team’s excitement is conspicuous. The four team members behind Rafla (left to right): Sirpa Anundi, Kari Aihinen, Piia Emilia and Carita Peltonen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sun-spot-powers-up-in-africa/,Sun Spot powers up in Africa,"Thanks to an entrepreneurial Finnish family, solar energy is within reach of more Ugandans than ever before. When  packed his bags and departed Uganda a few weeks ago, he did so with a smile on his face. Having lived there for a year, it wasn’t just the thought of returning home to Finland that buoyed his mood; moreover, he felt a sense of achievement. Situated close to the Equator, Uganda is in a prime location to embrace the sun as a power source. But price has always been the main hurdle to the widespread implementation of the necessary technology. Recent developments, however, have changed the playing field. Exponentially. “Always with businesses you need a bit of luck to succeed,” Kettunen explains, matter-of-factly. “The Chinese started to produce these good quality crystalline-type of solar panels. It was not good for EU manufacturers, but really good for Africa and other developing countries.” How good was it? The price of solar panels has dropped around 80 per cent in five years. Kettunen was indeed in luck, having established  , Uganda’s first-ever facility for the assembly of solar energy systems in 2011. Viljami Kettunen (pictured in the upper right corner), established Sun Spot in Kampala in 2011. An entrepreneur and investor in the pharmaceutical and healthcare business since the late ‘90s, some five years ago Kettunen turned his focus towards the emerging renewable energy field. Together with his wife,  , their firm Foxley Consulting has helped kick-start business development projects in Northern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Located on the outskirts of Kampala, Sun Spot represents a prime business model for expansion across a continent frequently hindered by power cuts. Consisting of a warehouse and assembly plant, here Chinese components help create ready-made kits that can power anything from water heaters to perimeter fence lamps. “We want to reach people in rural areas, so they can have access to energy,” Kettunen states. Sun Spot is also actively involved in bigger projects. “We now have big deals with Chinese road constructors in the town of Entebbe. We installed solar street lamps there; people are so happy.” While Sun Spot slowly gathered momentum during its first couple of years of operations, these past 12 months have seen a dramatic spike in sales. This is not all down to the affordable Chinese panels, mind you. Last year the company received a capital boost from the Energy Environment Project, an initiative funded by Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, the Austrian Development Agency and the UK’s Department for International Development. Promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in eastern and southern Africa, the 60 million-euro programme seeks to “create jobs, reduce poverty, enhance energy security and mitigate climate change”. Sun Spot’s annual turnover has since ballooned to hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Satisfied that Sun Spot has sufficient momentum towards a prosperous future, Kettunen has returned to Finland. He will continue managing the company from afar, turning his focus towards new projects. One of his chief goals has been achieved: involving locals in the company’s day-to-day operations. “I am really proud that I can give a job to ten people and pay them good money and a pension, and they are paying taxes,” he says. The company’s success also provides incentive for employees to continue their good work in Kettunen’s absence. As a businessman, this means an obvious return on investment, but his philanthropic side also hopes for a prosperous future for Uganda. “When I’m in my 60s and 70s I can go back and would like to see what I have achieved.” Sun Spot installed solar street lamps in the town of Entebbe."

This is how new Finnish gaming startup Superplus Games plans to break into global markets. It would be an understatement to describe the gaming market as merely competitive. It takes nerves of steel to enter the field as a startup, but Helsinki-based mobile gaming studio   knows what it is getting into. While the company was only officially established in March, its three founders have almost 30 years of combined experience in the industry and have been involved in over 70 titles, including such Finnish success stories as   and the   series. Now  ,   and   have set out to do something different: “We aim to make slightly smaller scale games that are aesthetically beautiful and have brave stylisations,” says Mäkinen, CEO of Superplus Games. “Often games today are quite sterilised in a way that instead of taking risks, generic solutions are used to appeal to as large an audience as possible. We want to do things differently and go to niche markets and use stylisations to target different user groups.” While Mäkinen, Mäkilä and Linnakangas have all worked at Angry Birds creator Rovio, what really brought the trio together was living beside each other. Many evenings spent together made them realise they shared similar views on aesthetics, what makes a great game and the dream of starting their own gaming company. Soon a few jokingly made remarks evolved into a real-world startup. “We have a good team dynamic so the idea of working together felt easy,” Mäkinen says. “And it has been great. Now our first game starts to be ready and practically we did it in six months. It would take most new gaming companies more than a year to create a game like this.” Retro Shot is an upcoming mobile game where mini-golf style control mechanisms are combined with an visual environment similar to ’80s pinball games. The game in question is  which is due to be released later this year for iOS and Android. Mäkinen describes it as a unique combination of mini golf and 80’s pinball games – and unsurprisingly its inspiration came from the subconscious: “It’s a funny story, but the truth is I played the game in my dreams sometime in January or February,” Mäkinen says with a laugh.”It felt like the perfect, fun to play mobile game. When I woke up I remembered the game completely and immediately drew it on paper. I also made a list of all its features.” After input from all team members, this dream has turned into a game that no doubt will appeal to all retro lovers. Inspired by 80’s arcade games and synthwave music, Retro Shot is set in an urban world complete with lasers, mist, exhaust fumes, explosions and neon lights. “Players gather riches by guiding a metallic marble in mini-golf style through different levels. The game levels resemble ’80s pinball games,” explains Mäkinen. “This [combination] hasn’t been done before and we have received very positive feedback from testers.” The game also has a very special soundtrack to complement its retro aesthetic. The synthwave style tracks have been composed for Retro Shot specifically by Finnish game musician   and Superplus is planning to release them on Spotify for everyone to enjoy. Currently Superplus is in talks with a major international game distributor regarding Retro Shot’s international testing and release. But while the company has set it sights on global markets and doesn’t rule out expanding beyond mobile platforms, initially it plans to keep its production small: Many foreign [gaming industry] people praise the level of openness and honesty here. There is no back stabbing and you don’t have to be afraid of somebody stealing your idea. “Our strategy is to develop slightly smaller games than many other companies. About two games per year is our long term goal,” explains Mäkinen. “If people like our [first] game, we’ll naturally start to grow but slowly. We’ll think very carefully who we want to hire and why.” This is made easier by the openness of the Finnish gaming industry. Mäkinen recalls how ten years ago monthly industry meetings were attended by barely a dozen people and now the same meetings gather hundreds of gaming professionals who are happy to share their ideas and experiences. “It is wonderful how many new people you see and how people believe in themselves and their games,” Mäkinen enthuses. “Many foreign [gaming industry] people praise the level of openness and honesty here. There is no back stabbing and you don’t have to be afraid of somebody stealing your idea.” We would hope a second psychedelic pinball mini golf game with ’80s synth music would quickly be noticed."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nokia-s-descendants/,Nokia’s descendants,"Nokia has left behind many traces of itself in Finland. Frequently these traces lead to new startup companies. Good News from Finland presents four companies whose founders are former Nokia employees.  “Nokia taught us how large, global companies operate. Like the ones that Trelab would prefer to see as its customers,” says  , CMO at the Tampere-based  . All of Trelab’s founding members are former Nokia employees with extensive experience in developing wireless devices and the related sensors and other technologies. Already while at Nokia, they had a vision that these technologies could enable the creation of entirely new kinds of solutions. Trelab, established in 2011, has developed a wireless solution for the industrial internet. It enables the linking of old production equipment and new machinery to the same resource planning and control systems – i.e. the industrial internet. “Modern equipment is able to provide overall data on production. However, approximately 90 per cent of the devices in use are not capable of this, which means that they need to be monitored using special arrangements. Our solutions can be retrofitted to older equipment as well, which has previously fallen outside the realm of the industrial internet,” explains Koskinen. Trelab’s wireless and sensor-based solution is able to produce real-time information on the performance of devices and machines, and their operating environments. Nokia’s Bridge programme was launched in 2011. Through it Nokia offered its laid-off employees support for regaining employment. Those who took part in the programme were offered facilities, training and the opportunity to receive financial support for establishing a company. The programme benefitted 5000 employees in Finland and some 18 000 employees globally. Another graduate of Nokia’s Bridge programme is  , whose application can be used to quickly publish clips from, for example, TV shows on social media. This enables, for example, a sports caster to publish a video clip of a goal in almost real-time in an online article or on a social media channel. The founding trio of Tellyo has brought with it a wide range of expertise from Nokia:   worked on Nokia’s research strategy team creating a long-term research strategy.   developed ways for different devices to communicate among themselves and   worked at Nokia’s Financial Services unit. How did Tellyo get started? “We thought long and hard about how to make watching TV a more social experience. This led to the idea of creating a smart remote control, which was what we originally founded Tellyo on. Now with four development rounds behind us the idea and product look quite different, but the social aspect has remained,” says Koivisto. According to Koivisto, Nokia taught him ambition and how even a small team can change the world. “That happened inside Nokia several times. We also learned effective and professional ways of working in a multinational group,” Koivisto concludes. The story of  , a supplier of software development services, began in 2012. Its founding members, working at Nokia at the time, were aware that the software expertise of Nokia employees ranked among the best in the world. Juha Latvala treasures his decade-long experience at Nokia which spans three countries. “In many companies, including Nokia, the challenge, however, is finding ways to manage this kind of expertise and benefit from it. We were certain that we had something to offer companies in terms of how to achieve better results through the right kind of management systems and working models,” says Intopalo’s CEO  . Intopalo has the answer to this challenge: its highly efficient R&D cell model and development teams with global experience. These factors help the company stand out from its many competitors, according to Latvala. “Nokia was a unique experience on the Finnish scale and enabled us to work with numerous prominent international companies and their experts,” Latvala says. , established by  , is an exception within its sector compared to many of the other companies created through the Bridge programme.   of small children to support their children’s development. “The idea for starting up a company like this occurred during my maternity leave and due to the needs and insecurities I experienced during that time. I have also always been interested in children’s development psychology and learning,” says Belitz. Belitz is a psychologist by training but she previously worked in the world of software and web development. At Nokia she headed the user interface design team. She is able to utilise her experience in service design in Almondella’s business: the product boxes have been put together for families from a pedagogical viewpoint. Many factors led to her launching her own business. Belitz returned from her maternity leave to discover that the product that she had been developing was no longer in development and her old team had split up. “I had to look for a new work anyway. Also it just felt like the right moment because I had been interested in self-employment and startups for a long time. I pitched my business idea through the Bridge programme and Nokia provided support for it, which also required that I establish a company,” Belitz explains. Nokia taught her a way of thinking that maintains that it is possible, and even essential, to create Finnish products for the global markets: “I saw during my Nokia years how people all over the world have the same problems, joys and even tragedies. I took Almondella straight out onto international waters because, at the end of the day, we all have the same needs in similar life situations,” says Belitz. Sanna Belitz is able to utilise her experience in service design with Almondella: the product boxes are service packages created for families with children."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/in-game-advertiser-madberry-sets-up-headquarters-in-helsinki/,In-game advertiser Madberry sets up headquarters in Helsinki,"Advertising technology company Madberry has taken a step closer to its gaming industry customers by opening headquarters in Helsinki. One of the biggest challenges in the gaming industry today is attracting and retaining users amidst fierce competition. The Ukrainian founders of the technology company  ,  ,  and  are confident they know how to solve this problem. The first step is setting up the company’s new headquarters in Helsinki, the second is the imminent launch of its user acquisition and advertising tools for game marketers. “Our product is the world’s first automated advertising system designed specifically for game companies’ needs…and Helsinki is one the biggest gaming industry hubs in Europe,” says Sverdlik, CEO of Madberry. “Being close to our potential customers is the most important thing for us at the moment.” The two founders first started developing the company in New York, where Sverdlik was based at the time, before creating an engineering team in Ukraine and then its new base in Helsinki. Madberry’s offices were opened in the Finnish capital in September citing its gaming pedigree over New York and aims to grows its local staff of four to 10-12 by the first quarter of 2016. It is an impressive pace for a startup that was only founded in late 2014. While Madberry’s main engineering team stays in Kiev, Ukraine, Helsinki will serve as its base for core business operations and a future R&D centre. “We are going to proceed with the extension of our engineering team in Kiev, but have the core of our R&D, engineering and sales in Helsinki,” Sverdlik explains. “We are going to hire aggressively and also relocate three to four of our top engineers to Helsinki.“ “Our product is designed to make game advertising significantly cheaper and more efficient,” says Dmitry Sverdlik CEO of Madberry. Madberry’s is ramping up Finnish operations to swiftly introduce its game advertising system to the Nordic markets. The startup combines big data, machine learning and statistical mathematics to better understand gamers’ consumption behavior and consequently improve the efficiency of game marketing both outside and inside a game. “Our product is a great tool if you have just rolled out a free-to-play game and are trying to monetise through in-game payments,” says Sverdlik. “With algorithmic technology we are able to determine the precise probability that a specific gamer will be interested in a specific ad inside a game and click on the ad. We can for example predict how long they will stay in the game, whether and how much they will pay.” The same user behavior prediction is applied to game advertising campaigns to ensure ads are shown only to the most responsive audiences. This is made possible by analysing the crumb trail we all leave behind in the digital world. We visit sites, watch videos, check-in on social media and commit thousands of other small actions online. Madberry transforms this data into predictions on future behavior which it combines with its online media planning and buying services. Sverdlik stresses that everybody wins when highly relevant ad content is shown to consumers. It boosts user acquisition, retention and improves loyalty: “Game advertisers don’t need to spend their budget on irrelevant audiences who will never respond to their ad, while gamers only see ads that really interest them,” Sverdlik explains. “Publishers, whose sites and apps show ads, also have less users complaining about irrelevant ads.” Madberry is currently gathering feedback on its technology and algorithms with early stage customers in Finland, Israel and China. The goal is to have the system ready for a public launch in early 2016. “We will use the next 8-10 months to actively expand our business in Finland and the Nordic markets, that is our first priority,” Sverdlik says. “After that, maybe in ten months time, we are going to jump worldwide, but the Nordic market is a great place to pass your first mile.” Also on Madberry’s future roadmap are local offices in the US, Central Europe and Asia as well as plans to adapt its marketing technology for personalised advertising on Smart TVs and video-on-demand services. The role of the Finnish headquarters is to drive these ambitious plans: “We really like the business culture we have seen in Helsinki. People are very responsive and committed and it’s a very dynamic market,” Sverdlik says. “I believe something really big has emerged from the decline of Nokia and we want to explore it. It is good for us to be in the centre of the European gaming market.” Madberry is using its new headquarters in Helsinki to prepare for the launch of its automated advertising system for Nordic gaming companies."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/proxy-ventures-builds-startups-into-world-class-brands/,Proxy Ventures builds startups into world-class brands,"Take two Finns, a brand specialist and an academic, mix with London and you get the origin story of Proxy Ventures. The brand-focused venture capital firm is far from your typical investor and has some valuable tips to share. Funding is a key element for any growth-oriented company. But  , a London-based seed-stage investor with Finnish roots, offers its portfolio companies something unique besides euros – a world-class brand: “We have our own design studio, which means once we invest in a company we also build their brand for them,” says  , Founding Partner at Proxy Ventures. “Our hypothesis is that a great brand increases the value of a company.” Bovellan knows what he is talking about. Before starting Proxy together with wife   in late 2013, he left his mark on such global brands as Nokia and the Finnish gaming phenomenon Supercell. While Aapo brings the branding expertise, Miia uses her academic skills (it was her PhD work that brought the Finnish couple to London) to analyse the potential of interesting startups. Proxy wants to build successful companies with compelling brands and only invests in startups it knows it can brand. What quickly becomes clear is this means much more than a cool logo. In fact, the branding process starts by identifying why a company exists, its values and goals, and includes everything from naming and visual identity to packaging and digital design. “We haven’t seen anyone else do what we do. There are companies like Faber Ventures and Reaktor in Finland which offer a similar thing with coding, but we haven’t found any other real brand players,” Miia Bovellan says. “We want to be involved in creating great new brands and companies that employ a lot of people,” says Finnish co-founder Aapo Bovellan. There is a strong demand for Proxy’s brand-oriented approach. In two years the investor-slash- design studio has built a team of six and a portfolio of nine startups from Finland and the UK. The latest additions include two Finns: wellness ring creator Ōura and Paptic, the developer of an environmental alternative to plastic. Proxy always invests in a startup alongside other investors and most of its deals have come from fellow investors pulling the brand expert in. “A good branding project can cost anything from 100 000 to 200 000 euros and you never know what you get,” Aapo Bovellan says. “This is why our proposition appeals to other investors. If we are involved, the startup saves money and they know the quality we deliver.” But why should a startup care about branding? Bovellan believes the obvious customer appeal is only one aspect. Equally important is both the power of a strong brand to connect employees with the company and its culture and the professional focus which appeals to future investors. Currently Proxy Ventures looks to invest in three to four companies per year. It is very much a quality before quantity approach: “We want to stay small, I don’t think there will ever be more than ten of us. We don’t want to create hierarchies, we are all doers and designers,” says Miia Bovellan. “When a company comes to us they know they will get our A team because we don’t have any B teams.” ‘Small is beautiful’ is an attitude the Bovellans would also like to see startups embrace, especially when pitching to an investor: “You need to have a strict focus and not just a broad idea,” Bovellan notes. “The easier it is for you to understand what you really are selling, the easier it is for investors to do the same.” But there is one thing startups, especially Finnish ones, should be more vocal about. Proxy believes the credentials of a startup’s team are crucial to investors: “We don’t only look at whether people have worked for a great company, but what have they actually done there and have they been involved in getting something out to consumers,” Aapo Bovellan explains. “Finnish startups often forget to emphasise the team. In London if someone has achieved something they will shout it out loud and that is important for international investors.” He has one further tip: investors want to know there is demand for a company’s product. This means startups should launch their products early and not worry about honing them to perfection. “It is important to get something into the hands of your customers quickly. It doesn’t have to be perfect yet, but you can validate that people like the product and want to use it. That is the fastest way into the hearts of investors,” Bovellan concludes. Aapo Bovellan believes London’s mix of a thriving design industry with a robust financial market makes it a great location to help Finnish companies enter international markets."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/koukoi-games-heads-to-asia-with-a-million-dollars-in-pocket/,Koukoi Games heads to Asia with a million dollars in pocket,"Koukoi Games, a game studio hailing from Oulu, Finland, is only in its first year in business, but it will not have to travel empty-handed. The company gathered a group of over 20 investors, whose investments total a million dollars. The fact that the company has not published a single game yet indicates the investors’ firm belief in its success. With the million-dollar investment,   is trying to break into the Asian market from Singapore. According to the CEO  , many investors were convinced by the international aspect that is taken into account in the company’s strategy from the word “go”. “The funding enables us to scale our activities internationally, strengthen our team, and take our first game into the market strongly,” he says. The first target is Asia, which Kananen describes as one of the biggest markets for gaming industry. Koukoi Games also aims at North America and the European markets. The money is not only flowing abroad; the investment means Koukoi Games will get a new, larger office in Oulu. “Many of our investors deemed it good that our team is located in Oulu, where the attitude is exceptionally persistent with long-term planning and activities.” Kananen points out that the company’s geographical location doesn’t play a big role in the gaming market. However, the team does believe in order to capture foreign know-how and expertise it is best to go and see it in action. One of Koukoi Games’ long-term plans is to establish an international team and potentially open offices abroad. “Finland has seen many international success stories, especially considering the size of the home market,” says Antti Kananen. The investors’ faith seems particularly fierce considering Koukoi Games has not published any games to date. The company’s first 3D mobile game Crashing Season, will be tested at the markets by the end of the year. The global audience will see the game in early 2016. Kananen deems the game “super funny and physics-oriented”. Players control different kinds of animal characters that are trying to survive in changing environments. “It is full of action, strange situations and fun surprises.” Afterwards new games will be hitting the market. Whether or not Crashing Season will have sequels remains to be seen in the coming months. Koukoi Games’ core idea is to create games that stick with people similarly to those played by Koukoi Games team members as children. “Marketing develops and competition gets tougher. It is important to us make our games so memorable that people remember them through years to come.” Remembering games is not the only plan Koukoi Games has in store for its future. The only detail that has been told to the public is that the company will enter another field of business in addition to making games. ”More will be revealed next spring, after we have met some necessary goals.” Kananen says that the Finnish gaming industry and mobile games are doing extremely well. “Finland has seen many international success stories, especially considering the size of the home market. A lot of effort is being put into growing the industry, and the knowledge is developing rapidly.” For Koukoi Games, being Finnish has a special meaning – particularly the Finnish sisu. They plan on using Finnish mythology in both future productions and the company’s brand. The name Koukoi already has its roots in the Finnish national epic, Kalevala. “We are attempting to bring along a piece of Finnish craziness to freshen up the markets,” Kananen sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-creates-one-feedback-service-to-rule-them-all/,Finnish startup creates one feedback service to rule them all,"Services like TripAdvisor have made it possible to publicly review everything from corner shops to holiday resorts, but what if we just want to give direct feedback? Finnish startup Gizlo believes the best channel for this can be found in our pockets. Feedback is invaluable for any company who wants to learn about their customers. Still we often leave a shop or a cafe without mentioning what annoyed or delighted us or give ideas for improvement. This is where   steps in. The Finnish startup has developed a simple digital service for consumers to leave direct feedback on the places where they eat and shop. “We realised people don’t want to use a different feedback channel for every shop, restaurant or a hotel. Instead they want one standardised service they can use to leave feedback everywhere,” says  , CEO and co-founder of Gizlo. Which is why Gizlo focuses on ease-of-use. Open the service on an app or a browser, choose a place from a list of nearby businesses (suggested based on your location), write your feedback and it is delivered directly to the business. It does not matter if the place has not registered with the service or not, Gizlo will make sure the feedback gets delivered. People can use the service to help to improve the places they like to visit and companies gain valuable real-time data on customer experiences. The service is free for companies to use, but Gizlo is also planning to introduce paid premium features. “The easier it is to leave feedback, the more companies will receive not only corrective but also positive feedback and ideas,” says Ek, explaining the thinking behind Gizlo. “When everything has gone wrong and you want to make a reclamation, [customers] are ready to walk to the head office to get it sorted. But when it is complicated to communicate ideas and positive feedback to a company, you won’t make the effort.” It seems Gizlo has chosen the right approach. Since the service was first launched in early 2015, it has been used for feedback over 100 000 times in Finland and 50 000 times in its other test market, the UK. Gizlo wants to take its time to first hone its digital feedback system in Finland and the UK and then expand to other markets, starting with the US. Although Gizlo has now found its market, it has taken a few turns to get there. When the company was founded in late 2013 by Ek,  ,   and  , they wanted to tackle the challenge of connecting businesses and their customers, but their first product focused on market research surveys using mobile devices. “Instead of thinking how to make it easy for people to give feedback, we thought about moving the surveys companies already do online to mobile,” Ek recalls. “Although people liked the solution, it didn’t solve the problems with giving feedback. By the end of 2014 we had around ten solutions and realised it is actually the feedback channel that needs standardising.” This change in strategy led Gizlo to develop its current digital system and opened new doors for the startup. It secured major Finnish retail and restaurant chains, including S Group and Kotipizza, among its first customers. Armed with its new offering, Gizlo is now raising it first round of seed funding to build on its 600 000 euro early investment from Finnish serial entrepreneurs, venture capital funds and the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). Gizlo’s ultimate goal is to create a global standard for giving feedback. Initially the startup has focused on the retail and restaurant sectors, but its aim is to expand the digital feedback channel to cover every consumer sector. “We are now introducing different events, venues and also the public sector, including hospitals, to become part of the service,” Ek explains. “The basis is that everywhere people visit, they also want to leave feedback.” Despite its mission of unification, Gizlo also stresses that other feedback channels remain complementary rather than competitive. In fact, the startup recommends companies offer several feedback channels as some consumers will always prefer to write their thoughts on paper, fill in a form or call the customer service line. “The main thing is that companies not only collect feedback but act on it. The more feedback they get, the more it directs them to listen to it,” says Ek. “We want to offer people the easiest way to make themselves heard.” “We believe that in ten years time there will be one, two or three leading feedback services in the world and we want to be one of them,” says Kalle Ek, CEO of Gizlo."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lillagunga-swings-into-business-globally/,Lillagunga swings into business globally,"The humble swing has been giving children a lift for centuries, yet quality products have been hard to find in recent times. This Finnish company seeks to change all that, by taking their wooden products to the world. Years ago when he was a young boy, there was nothing that   liked to do more than use the swing at his parents’ summer cottage. The rush of freedom he felt was exhilarating as his toes reached higher and higher into the air. And so, decades later when he became a parent himself, he was eager to share this experience with his own children. Setting out in search of a suitable swing, the task proved more difficult than he first thought. “I wanted something that was good quality and also looked good, but I couldn’t find anything,” he recalls. “I purchased what was available: a cheap, rather lightweight plastic model. It worked for a while before it broke.” And so, having only just introduced his children to the joys of swinging, there was no way Stenfors could turn around and inform them that it was now destined for the scrap heap. Luckily, the solution lay at the foot of the tree in his garden, in the shape of a stray plank of wood. Swiftly securing his new find to the existing ropes, crisis was averted and soon his children were once again enjoying the wind blow through their hair. Impressed with the durability of his new design, Stenfors pondered the possibilities: surely there must be other children who would enjoy the same thing at home. After taking another look at the barren marketplace, he concluded that there was ample potential for a good quality Finnish-made product. Drawing on his background in product and concept development, the business idea took root when he teamed up with a local company that could handle production. Eventually, they decided that customers should be able to choose between different wood types and ropes, in order to construct their custom-made swing. Taking its name from the Swedish word for ‘small swing’,   was airborne in May 2013. The Lillagunga Classic attracted strong orders and positive feedback from the get-go. Such was the level of response that two further models went into production, one for toddlers and the other, somewhat unsurprisingly, for fully-grown adults. While focus was initially on the local market, subsequent years have revealed considerable international interest. “A swing is a universal product; it’s known all over the world,” Stenfors explains. “We have shipped everywhere from Taiwan to Canada, to all around Europe, Australia and the USA. Many have contacted us directly and also through our resellers in France, London and Taiwan.” With this in mind, the company is now on the cusp of further growth, thanks to a 50 000-euro crowdfunding round. Its portfolio of products is also set to expand. First cab off the rank is a pair of wooden gymnastic rings. “Basically we could reinvent anything that is a classic product,” Stenfors emphasises. “Next could be a trapeze, or a chair, or maybe wooden cars or small wooden planes. As long as it brings joy and looks good.”   Lillagunga produces swings for toddlers and also for fully-grown adults."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/varaani-revolutionises-digital-data-storage/,Varaani revolutionises digital data storage,"The volume of digital content is rapidly increasing both at home and in the office environment. The Finnish company Varaani tackles the challenges of saving that content. Next year, the company will launch a consumer product that is the first of its kind in the world. “The average amount of digital content in households is already estimated at more than one terabyte, and it is expected to grow to as much as two terabytes next year,” says   CEO  . “Everyone talks about the cloud as a storage solution, but in reality only around seven per cent of households’ data is currently stored in the cloud.” The majority of data is thus still stored locally, but the tools available are not yet efficient or versatile enough to meet the needs of local storage. This is the challenge that Varaani has tackled by developing a new hybrid solution. “Our solution includes a local storage device, but in addition to that, all data is automatically stored in the cloud,” Lahdensivu says. Varaani primarily collaborates with broadband operators, which means that the product is made as a private label product sold with the operator’s brand. No similar product exists so far in the world. Varaani has been granted a patent for its device in the United States and in Finland. “Basically, cloud services are what all major actors, such as Google and Apple, are focusing on right now. Against this backdrop, it makes no sense for us to compete only on that market. In practice, our service caters for three different markets: it combines local storage devices, cloud and online back-up services. We roll into one the key characteristics of these three different product groups,” Lahdensivu explains. The industrial design of Varaani’s consumer product was created in Finland. For the consumer, all this may sound quite technical. However, Varaani’s goal is that the users of their service do not have to think about technology; instead, they can count on their data to be stored safely. Varaani has a user-driven approach to product development in every respect: instead of selling just a product, they also sell the service that goes with it. Until now, Varaani’s service has been sold primarily to SMEs, but early next year, the company will also launch a product targeted at consumers. It will be the company’s flagship product, the result of six years of work. Today, Varaani mainly operates in Finland, although it has already done business in the corporate sector in the Netherlands and in India. Next year, the company’s main markets are expected to be found entirely outside Finland. “Our intention from the get-go was to do global business. With the launch of our new product, we are now tapping into international consumer markets in addition to corporate sales. We are looking for partner operators especially from Europe and Latin America,” Lahdensivu says. Varaani was founded by ex-Nokia employees in 2010. According to Lahdensivu, the company is still clearly a startup: it relies almost entirely on external financing sources. In its early days, it was funded by a group of angel investors, and the ICT service company Anvia acquired a 25 per cent share in the company through an A financing round organised a year ago. The startup spirit also shines through in the company’s positive attitude: Varaani is very excited about the upcoming product launch and the move to consumer markets. “Although Nokia used to work with consumer products, Finnish startups have generated fairly few products targeted at consumers. We are proud to bring a new Finnish ICT product to the world,” says  , Varaani’s vice president of global sales."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-gaming-company-crafts-creativity-for-schools/,Finnish games studio crafts creativity for schools,"TeacherGaming is the brainchild of three teachers who are, themselves, gamers. The company has already made learning more fun in 10 000 schools around the world. “Our greatest challenge is to make sure that the games don’t reek of school,” says   with a laugh. The CEO of the games company   knows how to get students to pay attention. While still a student teacher, he came up with the idea of using the   computer game to teach his students. In   players can go on adventures and create structures in an open game environment. The kids’ reaction was enthusiastic and other teachers came by to ask if Koivisto would give them instructions on how to play the fun-looking game. “That’s how I knew that I had come up with something cool,” says Koivisto. Koivisto took his students to the local Scifest science fair and received approval from  ’s Swedish developers Mojang to use the game on a broader scale for teaching. Koivisto also had the brilliant idea of asking Mojang if he could be the game’s Finnish educational representative. “They said they had no idea what I meant. I said, neither do I, but let’s give it a go.” At the same time, across the Atlantic, an American teacher named  started up a blog describing his experiences of using   for teaching purposes. The blog made it onto the front page of Reddit and soon attracted more than 10 000 followers. Koivisto noticed the buzz surrounding Levin and suggested in a blog comment chain that they collaborate. In May 2011, at the end of their first Skype conversation, they decided to set up a company. TeacherGaming was officially established in November 2011 and the next February the business partners met each other face to face for the first time. The idea behind the company was to repackage entertainment games for teaching purposes. Currently the   and   games are used in nearly 10 000 schools around the world. This number is three times the Finnish school network. “Our goal is to change the world, which we have, in fact, already done. At least the worlds’ of the children at those 10 000 schools,” Koivisto points out. “With the help of our client schools we try to stay abreast of what kids are doing these days,” says TeacherGaming’s CEO Santeri Koivisto (in the black hoodie). The games are meant to be fun, first and foremost, but their impact is much broader. Games are a familiar environment for children, in which they can be active learners. For teachers, TeacherGaming’s games are a tool for getting children involved – also in a school environment. Koivisto is hopeful that teaching through games will cause the power balance in schools to shift so that children will be able to impact and produce content for games themselves. In addition the games can teach children digital civics. “A separate classroom is used in which the teacher or student can modify a virtual space to suit the situation,” says Koivisto. “Our goal has been to focus on building, working together and solving problems.” How do the educational games differ from playing for entertainment? Koivisto draws an analogy with football. “Playing in the playground at recess is fun but so is playing at a football practice with a coach. We want to draw teachers out of their comfort zones but in a way that allows them to still feel in control,” he says. More than 5 500 teachers in more than 40 countries have already used   in their work. The subjects they teach vary between physics and languages, history and art. Approximately 60 per cent of users can be found in the United States, the rest in the UK, Australia and other countries. In Finland the network includes around twenty schools. In a good month some 500 schools join the network. The games address the same challenges in every country. “Most schools are built based on the same system and problems include students’ apathy and lack of interest,” Koivisto says. “In Finland these phenomena are relatively minor, so there isn’t a major hurry to change things in schools. In the United States criticism towards the system has continued for so long that they are more willing to try things on an impulse.” Children can have many ideas for improving their schools but they lack the language to turn them into development suggestions that adults can approve of. TeacherGaming has grown at a remarkable speed even though its founders do not have previous experience in the games industry. The company, made up of three teachers, a lawyer and a programmer, doubled its revenue during 2014 and it looks likely that 2015 will prove to be just as successful. “We have been lucky in that we have had the chance to work with games that are already wonderful to begin with. We’ve just thought about how to bring school into the picture without ruining the game,” Koivisto explains. ”We learn by doing; that is one thing I discovered in teacher training.” The company has now started developing its own games, which are scheduled for release in 2016. Their guiding principle has been to develop games so that entertainment comes first and learning skills is an integral part of the game mechanics. The company has, to date, been run on the founders’ money. With fresh winds blowing, TeacherGaming is beginning to seek out venture capitalists who would be able to offer not just financing for their projects, but also other things such as school networks. According to Koivisto, instead of trying to raise money, the company’s objective is to create projects that are as crazy as possible, making school more interesting. Good feedback from schools has been an important source of motivation for the startup. “Sometimes we get told that we have completely changed the teaching experience for someone. Strong feedback kept us at our work even when we weren’t collecting a paycheck,” Koivisto concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/christmas-in-finland-more-or-less-important-facts/,Christmas in Finland – more or less important facts,"You hopefully already know that Santa Claus is from Finland. Maybe you have also heard that for most of the Finns, the Christmas Eve (24 December) is the most important day over Christmas. We gathered a couple more or less important facts about Christmas in Finland.  No Caption During Christmas, the average amount of snow is normally around 40 centimetres in Lapland, 30 centimetres in Central Finland and 10 centimetres in Southern parts of Finland. Finns often hope to have a white Christmas – at least everyone seems to have golden memories from their childhood when “there was always snow during Christmas”. Especially in the Southern part of Finland the speculations whether the Christmas will be white or not, start already in the beginning of December. No Caption Every year there are around 1.5 million Christmas trees in Finland: around 54 per cent of Finnish households have a Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is usually always a spruce. No Caption Last year Finns sent 37 million Christmas cards. That’s around 6 cards per person.  Merry Christmas in Finnish is “Hyvää joulua” and in Swedish, Finland’s other official language, “God jul”. Santa’s main post office in Lapland gets more than 30 000 cards and letters a day during the holiday season. No Caption Finns spend around 517 euros on Christmas. From this amount 311 euros is used to buy gifts. The most popular gifts are books, clothes, chocolate and other candies. There are a lot of possibilities to give money or presents to charity during Christmas. One of the most traditional ones is the Christmas Kettle fundraising by the Salvation Army. Last year almost 900 000 euros together with Christmas packages of clothes and food was gathered for the Salvation Army. No Caption The most traditional Christmas food is baked ham: seven out of ten households buy the ham for the Christmas dinner. 93 per cent of the hams bought during Christmas are originally from Finland. Other traditional Christmas foods are casseroles containing different vegetables including rutabaga, carrot and potato.  Also fish dishes are popular. To sweeten up things a little, Finns usually enjoy rice porridge with spiced plum jam. Also self-made Christmas pastries and gingerbreads are popular. No Caption Sauna is an important part of Finnish Christmas. It is a tradition to go to the sauna on Christmas Eve. Luckily this is not too difficult for most of the Finns: It is estimated that there are around two million saunas in Finland, meaning that many households have their own."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-gluten-free-pasta-gluto-overcomes-culinary-barriers/,Finnish gluten-free pasta Glutø overcomes culinary barriers,"The gluten-free fresh pasta produced by the Finnish company Glutzero continues to spark interest abroad. Its secret lies in healthy ingredients and a precise manufacturing process.  was founded in June 2014 by two Italian gentlemen,   and  . A gluten-free diet had become more than just a way of life for coeliacs: it was a growing global food trend that was constantly ‘on everyone’s lips’. Lembo and Pelosi saw their market niche and decided to start producing gluten-free fresh pasta in Finland. Today Glutzero’s products, such as fresh ravioli, fettuccine and rigatoni pastas are available in, for example, major grocery stores in Finland and in an Italian restaurant at Helsinki-Vantaa airport. “Our pasta is made of corn, rice flour and Finnish water – water that has been ranked the cleanest in the world by UNESCO. Nothing else is added”, Glutzero’s CEO   explains in an interview at the company’s office in Helsinki. Consequently, the company’s products are not only gluten-free but vegan proof as well: they do not contain egg, dairy products or additives. Glutzero’s pasta recipes and the manufacturing procedure have been developed by the two pasta masters Lembo and Pelosi, both of whom have plenty of experience in the food and restaurant industry in Finland as well as in Italy. Lembo admits that inventing and developing the manufacturing process has not been ‘a piece of cake’. In general, pasta gets its texture from egg and wheat flour or from the mixture of the two. Glutzero’s pasta does not contain either of these two ingredients. “That process is the actual secret behind our pasta”, Lembo says. Manufacturing gluten-free food is a very precise procedure because it requires constant controls of ingredients and quality. “We have received a kosher certification, which proves that our product is vegan friendly. It is well-respected among vegetarians and vegans abroad”, Pousi highlights. Glutzero was founded in 2014 by Marco Lembo (left) and Maurizio Pelosi when a gluten-free diet had become a growing global food trend that was constantly ‘on everyone’s lips’. Glutzero started its pasta production early this year in the industrial neighbourhood of Kalasatama in Helsinki. For now, the pasta is made by only a few employees. However, the company might shortly need extra hands because of the increasing interest abroad. So far, Glutzero has done business in Italy and Israel, and Lembo and Pousi continue to receive enquiries from restaurants and retailers in the two countries. “Finnish pasta culture is relatively young, and we are therefore also targeting foreign markets. We are about to sign export contracts in the Czech Republic and Sweden and finalizing one in Norway”, Pousi says. According to Pousi, other potential markets for the company include France, Russia, the UK and the United States. At the moment, Glutzero is working to gain a further kosher certificate that would provide access to the American food market. Pousi and Lembo believe that the demand for gluten-free products will continue its global increase and are therefore confident that the company will have a bright future. In addition to the growing health awareness trend, the diagnosing of coeliac disease is evolving rapidly. “We rely on the fact that gluten-free diets will become more and more common. However, Glutø is not ideal for those with special diets only – it is actually perfect for all of us”, Pousi adds. After the official part, there is still the final – and maybe the most important – question to ask: Can a pasta made only of corn and rice flour actually be tasty? When I pose the question, Lembo disappears into the kitchen and shortly returns with a plate of Glutø pasta. It is certainly true: the pasta is tasty and its texture is equal to traditional pasta. I would not be able to tell it is gluten-free. Furthermore, Lembo tells me a story from a Roman restaurant. A while ago, he replaced the fresh pasta they used with Glutø to see how the customers reacted and whether they noticed the difference. Out of hundreds, only a couple of people asked which pasta they were serving. Considering Italians’ passion for food, this story can be considered to prove the great flavour of the pasta. “Once I ate our pasta without knowing that it was actually our own product. Later I realised that it had to be Glutø, it was simply so good!”, Lembo laughs. Glutzero’s pasta is made of corn, rice flour and Finnish water. Nothing else is added."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/zadaa-recycles-clothing-using-algorithm/,Zadaa recycles clothing using algorithm,"Manufacturing clothing is known to consume large volumes of clean water and energy. Despite this, many people use items of clothing just a handful of times and most people do not even recycle clothing that is in good condition. The startup company Zadaa created a service that encourages more people to think twice. “  is a mobile application that helps people sell and buy well-fitting, pre-loved clothing. We, the company’s founders, had not, in fact, visited a lot of flea markets before. We wanted to create a service that makes recycling clothing so easy that even we would do it more actively,” explains  , Zadaa’s CEO and co-founder. When signing in to the app, users enter their height and weight and select one of five international body types that is closest to theirs. In addition, users register their clothing size and style preference. Zadaa’s algorithm feeds each of the service’s users a personalised stream of clothing and presents the best matches, i.e. clothing twins – people whose size and style correspond with the user’s information. “Our service continually makes use of data that is available on the users. We don’t ask about style preferences just at the signing in stage; the service constantly monitors, for example, users’ purchases and clicks, and works to improve the offering presented to them,” Kormi explains. Competition in the second-hand markets is tough. Zadaa stands out from the competition due to its smart way of dealing with large volumes of data. On traditional services, such as Facebook flea markets and Ebay, all of the users can see the same content but Zadaa creates a personalised clothing network for the user. The application offers users a personalised stream of clothing and introduces them to their clothing twins, i.e. users with similar styles. “We were already familiar with Facebook flea markets, for example, and we were aware of their popularity. They do, however, have some limitations, such as a constant clamour about reservations and cancellations and, for example, the exchanging of account numbers in every direction. At Zadaa we want to do away with all this complexity,” says another of the company’s founders  . The application has already convinced many people: every day shoppers are buying and selling on the service, which was launched in September, and new users are joining each day. Currently the app is only available on Finland’s App Store but the plan is to expand to other European countries in the near future, with Sweden first on the list. Next September, the service should be up and running in 10 European countries. The company is participating in its first investment round. It will be used to support its bid to go global, hire an Android coder and acquire an office for the company. “Working on a shoe-string budget has, of course, created challenges during the company’s early days, but I think we’ve handled the lack of resources well. Another challenge that entrepreneurs face is prioritising: when an investment round is taking place and the service is already public we need to try and develop the service at the same time, come up with creative ways to market it and deal with all the related bureaucracy. Once the investment round is over we can, once again, begin allocating more time to developing the service,” Kormi points out. The challenges have, by no means, discouraged the young company: its vision is to become a globally known second-hand service within the space of three years. “We have a three-year five-step plan according to which we need to reach 150 countries by the third year. It’s ambitious but you have to be with a business like this that has an extremely scalable service,” says Chaichee."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/culinar-brings-restaurants-and-customers-together/,Culinar brings restaurants and customers together,"Increasingly, restaurant customers reserve tables and order their takeaway food online. Culinar, a startup from Tampere, wants to develop a comprehensive digital channel between restaurants and customers and, at the same time, offer restaurants valuable data on their customers. The idea for   originated in spring 2014 as a study project by three technology students.  ,   and   became frustrated with calling restaurants for takeaway and created a portal through which it would be possible to order meals directly online. Soon restaurants were asking for the takeaway service to be integrated onto their websites and the Culinar team noticed that most of the orders came through the restaurants’ own websites. Thus, the idea of a portal that compiles everything transformed into the goal of building more digital services targeted directly at restaurants. Culinar began to create tools for making table reservations and purchasing gift certificates, in addition to the takeaway service. According to Kainulainen, the goal is to serve as a digital interface between restaurants and consumers. “The majority of digital takeaway services operate through a portal in which commissions are large and the goal is to attract consumers to be the portal’s users. For restaurants these are mainly just another marketing channel. Our service was developed predominantly as the restaurants’ own service. We don’t even wish to compete with takeaway portals, instead, ideally, we could even function as their partners,” explains Kainulainen. The company was officially established in August 2014. The next summer, Culinar received funding from angel investors and Tekes. One of Culinar’s key ideas is to offer restaurants information on consumer behaviour. Culinar’s system registers, among other things, what kind of customers visit the restaurant, who are frequent visitors and which time of day is the busiest. This information helps the restaurant to focus its marketing on important repeat customers, for example. “We are now testing various options for utilising customer data. For example, a certain restaurant received takeaway orders especially on Fridays after three o’clock. The restaurant decided to advertise that they were offering a small discount on orders made on a Friday, resulting in a four-fold increase in the number of customers,” says Kainulainen. Currently Culinar serves altogether 50 restaurants in 12 cities in Finland. Next, the company is heading abroad and autumn 2015 has been spent fine-tuning their plan to go global. “A trial is now in progress in Oslo and Frankfurt where we wish to discover how the restaurant business differs from Finland’s so that we can perfect our service for the global markets. Our goal is to begin full-on marketing abroad at the beginning of 2016,” says Kainulainen. Although the restaurant business is gaining popularity among startups, Kainulainen is convinced that Culinar’s attractiveness will stand out from among the flurry of competition. “We imagine a restauranteur who wants to serve their customers as well as possible and how we can assist them. We want customers to be excited about the restaurant itself, not some third-party application,” Kainulainen stresses. The restaurant can see from Culinar’s service, for example, who are its most loyal clientele and what they have usually ordered."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tosibox-is-the-real-deal-in-iot-connectivity/,Tosibox is the real deal in IoT connectivity,"Tosibox offers a secure remote connection for industrial engineering machinery, swiftly connecting it with a global customer base in the process. As the Internet of Things gradually starts to take shape, two fundamental issues of concern continue to be raised in discussion: connectivity and security. One Finnish company in particular is poised to take care of business in these regards, on a global scale. “  is a high tech company that is making the world’s easiest and very secure remote connection over the Internet,” explains CEO . “Whoever wants to remotely control any machine, or security camera or whatever, we provide a very safe, fast and flexible solution for that.” One of Toxibox’s chief goals is to compensate for the dearth of IT experts in mid-size companies, by providing businesses with a lock and key solution. Competitiveness is improved exponentially, as management needn’t bleed funds by sending a service engineer abroad to assist a customer. Machinery can now be accessed from their comfort of their office after the product has been shipped. Some 10 seconds out of its packaging and Tosibox automatically connects the device to a remote controller. When I was in the USA I was told that this is the solution the industry has been waiting for, for years. Unsurprisingly, many companies are sitting up and taking notice. “When I was in the USA I was told that this is the solution the industry has been waiting for, for years,” Lepistö explains. “The engineers there are very open minded. They immediately understand the product and take it into use. They realise it saves money and time and makes their lives easier.” With Tosibox receiving the green light to sell there last summer, an increasing number of companies Stateside are now reaping these benefits. The seed of Tosibox’s success was sown in the northern Finnish town of Oulu, when CTO   established the company in 2011 on the back of his product idea. A hop-skip-and-jump later and turnover in 2014 ballooned to 1.24 million euros, representing a 60 per cent increase year-on-year. “Whoever wants to remotely control any machine, or security camera or whatever, we provide a very safe, fast and flexible solution for that,” says Tero Lepistö, CEO of Tosibox. Lepistö emphasises that Tosibox is not solely focused on North America. Alongside strong local sales in Finland, a number of significant global companies have recently embraced Tosibox’s product portfolio. Tosibox is actively nurturing business opportunities in Central Europe, with its presence on the German market receiving a particular boost recently after being selected as a top 20 company at the TÜV SÜD Innovation Awards 2015 in Munich. Altogether, close to half of the company’s current sales are from abroad, with more than 20 000 products shipped to over 70 countries worldwide thus far. Looking ahead, unsurprisingly, Lepistö sees nothing but potential on the horizon for Tosibox. “There is no limit to what this product can do, as long as it is something to do with the Internet. We are very excited and optimistic about our success.” And so he should be: Lepistö estimates company revenue to hit tens of millions of euros in the not to distant future. Given the rosy future ahead, it is inevitable that many around the world less versed in the Finnish language will ponder the meaning of the company’s name. The word ‘box’ is a given, sure, but how about the four letters placed before it? What does the  in ‘Tosibox’ mean, exactly? “  mean something real, something true,” Lepistö explains. “You can have several translations for our name, but we like to think that it’s ‘really something’.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kasperi-rethinks-urban-mobility-through-design/,Kasperi rethinks urban mobility through design,"A defining feature of these leather bags is influencing the fashion of business: they are 100 per cent made in Finland. The lion’s share of companies specialising in clothes and accessories in Finland eventually move their production abroad when they internationalise. For many, the local costs are too big an obstacle to overcome. Not so for leather bag makers  . “Made in Finland” is a big part of their identity. By utilising local raw materials and production, the Kasperi crew is keeping a close eye on maintaining a high standard of quality. This in turn encourages customers to form a long relationship with their bags. “Consumption cycles are getting very short, especially in fashion and consumer electronics,” states   from Kasperi’s office-cum-storeroom in the hip Helsinki suburb of Kallio. “But, if we give a consumer a product that they really like and they notice that it is only getting more personal and better with time, we can communicate the value of investing in more lasting stuff.” Cities such as Berlin and Munich are just the beginning, with the company setting its sights on the biking cities of Copenhagen and Amsterdam, as well as London and Paris. At present there are around 16 different Kasperi models, ranging from shoulder bags to offerings that comfortably accommodate a laptop. This is in contrast to the situation that founder and photographer  was faced with back in 2011, when he sought to carry his camera equipment as he cycled between shoots. Finding nothing suitably versatile and durable on the market, Suhonen began designing something from scratch that would suit his needs. Eventually the finished product was suitably large and adjustable, with an all-important stabilising strap that kept it from inconveniently swaying about as he cycled. Fast-forward to May 2015 and Suhonen’s hobby had grown into a business. Taking his middle name as its moniker, Kasperi’s initial focus has been on bike bags, yet the door remains open to expanding their range. “We want to rethink urban mobility,” Tervanen explains. “We want to keep it broad, so it can direct us in whatever we do.” Attracting a broad range of customers, Kasperi’s wholly Finnish approach is already carving out a competitive advantage abroad. “We thought Germany would appreciate the functional point of view of our bag,” Tervanen recalls. “It turns out they are really excited that everything comes from the Nordics; it’s made here. That’s something unique. Germans can do functional, that’s an oversold concept there.” Cities such as Berlin and Munich are just the beginning, with the company setting its sights on the biking cities of Copenhagen and Amsterdam, as well as London and Paris, where peddle power is growing in popularity. Looking further afield, Seoul and Tokyo are also on the radar. Regardless of where Kasperi travels with its bags, the one thing that Tervanen emphasises is that the company is doing everything it can to keep production in Finland. This includes encouraging younger generations attending local schools to make use of its production facilities to help spur their interest in leathercraft. Alongside making direct sales, Kasperi is also teaming up with fellow small businesses, as part of a push to build a community based around the idea of urban mobility. “If everyone could think about not selling through big wholesalers, but instead from partnerships with others and form their own shops or local places, they could get better value for their work,” he explains."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/new-finnish-districts-develop-a-green-perspective/,New Finnish districts develop a green perspective,"While much of the buzz surrounding smart innovations focuses on emerging startups, Finnish cities are also rolling up their sleeves, creating a number of new districts that draw on ecologically sound approaches. Cities around Finland have been smartening up in recent years, with Tampere in particular leading the way. According to the Mayor of Tampere , smart cities bring together “technological expertise, digital services, sustainable development innovations, startups and growth companies.” With this in mind the city is actively seeking new housing, transport and service solutions, with its enthusiasm for creating a smart future embodied by its landmark   development. “Today Vuores is the most rapidly growing urban quarter in Tampere,” explains project director . “We are getting between 500-700 new inhabitants per year.” Once completed in 2020, Vuores is set to house some 13 000 people and create thousands of workplaces. When Kalasatama city district in Helsinki is completed in the 2030s, it will house 20 000 residents, who are being encouraged to help create and trial smart solutions across all areas. Located some seven kilometres from the city centre, Vuores displays a number of innovative examples of eco-efficiency. Public transport, walking and cycling are emphasised by its traffic system plan, and management solutions control the LED lighting that illuminates streets and parks. Meanwhile, all of the buildings in the area have a built-in high-speed Internet network, ensuring Internet of Things connectivity. Vuores’ waste management system also significantly reduces service traffic and emissions. After sorting their solid trash into four different categories, residents then transfer it to local waste inlets. The rubbish is stored here in 300-litre storage silos, where it is gradually broken down and reshaped, before being transferred to a collection point via a pneumatic pipe. The new district also contains the largest modern wooden urban milieu in Finland, Isokuusi. “The name translates to ‘big spruce’,” Tamminen explains. “It’s part of Vuores itself, but is a sub-centre as well.” Here business premises are being constructed, alongside numerous wooden apartments and homes that will eventually house a total of 4 000 people. Innovative approaches to material efficiency, lifecycle planning, energy and power systems have been taken into consideration when creating this carbon-neutral space. Smart energy is also a common theme embraced by other eco-sound developments around Finland. The energy system of Helsinki’s former harbour and waterfront industrial area  , for example, is harnessing solar power. Altogether some 4 000 solar panels are to power up the smart grid, supporting electric vehicles, energy storage facilities and energy-efficient building automation. When this new city district is completed in the 2030s, it will house 20 000 residents, who are being encouraged to help create and trial smart solutions across all areas. Meanwhile, the largest new city district being built in the north of Finland,  , similarly acts as a testing ground for energy-efficient schemes. Located just outside the city of Oulu, this new area will eventually house 20 000 new residents. Interestingly, while ICT and new technologies are often swiftly incorporated in Finland, the innovations being implemented by new districts around the country are not only technical. “Here in Finland there are also some new developments where the city has the precondition that every developer has to have artists in its planning team,” Tamminen observes. “In each building there must be some works of art. This gives a certain flavour to the built up environment.” With this in mind, Finland is certainly perfecting the art of building a smart city. Hiukkavaara acts as a testing ground for energy-efficient schemes. The new area will eventually house 20 000 new residents."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/soil-scout-digs-deep-for-water-efficiency/,Soil Scout digs deep for water efficiency,"The Internet of Things is heading underground, thanks to this three-pronged innovation. And now some good news for the Finnish golfers who are currently twiddling their thumbs impatiently during the cold and dark off-season: soon you won’t have to wait until the snow has melted outside before teeing off. Thanks to  , the season can be brought forward a fraction sooner. “We have developed technology that enables us to wirelessly transmit environmental data from deep below ground,” explains the company’s CEO  . Thus, once Soil Scout’s sensor platform indicates that the earth underground has thawed, any remaining snow atop can be swiftly cleared away from the greens and fairways. Game on! “Golf is using 9.5 billion litres of water a day globally. That’s the daily fresh water requirements of 4.5 billion people. Up to 50 per cent of that is being wasted because there’s no convenient and permanent monitoring solution,” says Jonathan Skelly. Soil Scout’s small, three-pronged “Scout” accurately reports levels of moisture, temperature and salinity in real-time, from as deep as four metres below the surface. Doing away with the need for inconvenient solutions that sit on top of the soil, once buried, the Scout operates for up to 20 years maintenance-free. The roots of the sensor platform can be traced back to company CTO  ’s PhD studies as a soil scientist. A 19th generation farmer, Tiusanen fine-tuned the concept’s capabilities over 12 years of R&D after he first came up with the idea. Once he was finally satisfied, Soil Scout was formed in May 2013 in order to commercialise the technology. Addressing the B2B market, the company’s obvious first port of call was the two trillion-euro agriculture industry. However, it quickly became clear that the technology had also piqued the interest of other big players. “Golf is using 9.5 billion litres of water a day globally,” Skelly states. “That’s the daily fresh water requirements of 4.5 billion people. Up to 50 per cent of that is being wasted because there’s no convenient and permanent monitoring solution.” With around 40 000 golf courses being managed worldwide, Soil Scout quickly broadened its focus. Business has been developing quickly. Alongside its Finnish rollout, Soil Scout is in the process of entering the UK market, and commercial trials have recently been given the green light in the USA, South Africa, Australia and Brazil. “What we have developed here is effectively a platform for belowground IoT,” Skelly explains. “No one has been able to transmit below the ground deeper than a few centimetres.” The likes of soil, clay, concrete, snow and ice represent no obstacle for Soil Scout. “From that point of view we are chatting to some customers, and happy to talk to others, about licensing into fields we haven’t even thought of,” Skelly states. The growing interest in the technology is unsurprising: statistics indicate there will be plenty of need for Soil Scout’s device in future. “Between now and 2050, the world is going to need a 300 per cent increase in the amount of water to service the needs of the next two billion in population,” Skelly outlines. “What motivates us is the excitement to make a tangible change.”"

Virtually the whole world agrees it is essential to start using renewable energy sources.   knows why reality stands in the way of dreams. ”The supply of solar and wind power varies depending on the time of day and weather,” Teraloop CEO   explains. “If the majority of the world’s energy comes from the sun or the wind, supply won’t meet demand when it is cloudy or there is no wind. That means lights will go out.” According to Ridgway Watt, Teraloop’s vision is to overcome the threat of power cuts. The company’s solution is to store the power from wind turbines and solar panels and release it when needed. Teraloop’s technology is a combination of techniques used both in magnetically-levitated rail and in flywheels in a form that allows for kinetic energy to be stored safely underground and out of sight. Because the sun and wind do not produce energy at the same pace all the time, stabilising the power current is of importance, too. “Only through storing we can make solar and wind power serve us 24 hours a day. Teraloop’s technology offers not only revolutionary storage capacity, but also a new way of balancing energy transfer and voltage variation in the grid,” Ridgway Watt says. Ridgway Watt emphasises that storing energy is important to the whole energy industry, but the current technologies cannot meet the global demand. “You can say we are in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.” Storing renewable energy and releasing it on-demand is a global challenge. “It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of it or how difficult it is to store energy using the technology that is currently available. Pumped hydroelectric storage, for example, can’t be used everywhere.” Teraloop’s technology allows for kinetic energy to be stored safely underground and out of sight. Ridgway Watt sees the need for new innovations. The industry is desperate for solutions that enable increasing the level of renewable power sources. The door is open – all that is needed is the technology. ”Our system will utilise an already proven phenomenon, but it will be operating in more demanding conditions. In other words, the engineers’ job is to convert the art of the possible into reality. That may seem daunting but let’s face it; if the human race had run from every big challenge then we would still be chasing our dinner with spears!” The next step for Teraloop and its partners is to build a demonstration that will be connected to the grid. Its purpose is to prove that the system can be manufactured efficiently, durably, and safely. Then it will be turn for a larger scale pilot plant, which will showcase the technology to potential customers all over the globe. The pilot plan is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Environmentally friendly energy alternatives have been studied and developed for a good while. Ridgway Watt points out that initially the focus was on production. Once production improved, energy storage proved to be an issue. Teraloop’s potential customers are large renewable energy companies and local distribution operators. For regular people, Teraloop’s technology means a growing supply of renewable energy for an affordable price. “Most people recognise the need for more renewable energy,” Ridgway Watt mentions. It is not only about Finns, but the whole world. According to Ridgway Watt, the United States and China pose the most potential, because they have the biggest production capacities of renewable energy. Europe also has developed supply of renewable energy, making it a suitable stepping stone to the global market. “The goal is to make the Nordic countries and Europe coal-free by 2025.” Teraloop wants to rearrange the global energy landscape. Trealoop team from left to right: Mikko Järvinen, Philippe Pépin, Edward Ridgway Watt, Petri Saarinen and Marco Tatti. Teraloop’s home is in Helsinki, at the startup centre of Aalto University, which is where the company’s story begun. The innovators are   and  , who is also Teraloop’s chief relationship officer. In addition to Saarinen and CEO Ridgway Watt the core team includes COO   and two employees. Pépin tells that Teraloop is currently looking to expand its technological skills base. That is one of the reasons why Finland is a good base, as skilful engineers are in abundance. Skills aside, Ridgway Watt also praises the public funding Finland offers to innovations. “We have already been greatly supported by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, and we are looking for long-term cooperation, which will take us through the challenges ahead of us in the coming four years. Then we should have an established system ready to be commercialised.” The company’s goal is ambitious: to make Teraloop one of the world’s leading companies in creating renewable energy solutions to global challenges of reducing CO2 emissions. “We want to create a whole network of Teraloop storage systems all over the world, almost like an “ecological energy belt” around the world,” CRO Saarinen says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/brandbastion-keeps-watch-over-social-media/,BrandBastion keeps watch over social media,"It’s time to bid farewell to disruptions to your carefully tailored advertising campaign. These days it seems unimaginable that the humble telephone was once fixed to the wall and used merely for calling people. In fact, the likes of written letters and faxes now seem almost prehistoric, given the ease with which the global population can communicate. “There is a lot of great stuff with social media,” explains  , CEO of  . “It enables people to connect, also with the brands that they love. But there is also a dark side.” And then some. Tales of cyberbullying and trolling regularly make headlines, documenting lacerating abuse that frequently snowballs towards tragedy. One problematic occurrence receiving less coverage is the damage inflicted upon advertisers in this domain. With companies increasingly finding clever ways to reach prospective customers, this fresh marketing channel has become rife with harmful content. Facebook advertising in particular represents something of a free-for-all. “There is a lot of engagement that is not in the best interest of people and fans that are trying to communicate with their brand,” Wolfram explains. “This could be spam, phishing attempts, threats, malware, pornography or free gaming gems being spread.” Enter BrandBastion, offering constant “real-time protection of brand reputation and ad performance on social media”. An example of how a Facebook ad and harmful comments that it has received might look like. Image created by BrandBastion – the “Ultimate Power Bank” does not exist as a company nor do the commenters exist as people. (click to enlarge) A lawyer by trade, a few years ago Wolfram came across a case where a pharmaceutical company was being sued for harmful comments made by a third party on its Facebook page. These fallacies were considered part of its advertising campaign if the company didn’t remove them. Wolfram quickly realised that many others were in the same boat, battling a range of unforeseen problems online that threatened to land them in legal hot water. Thus, in 2013 she established a social media watchdog, dubbed it Faceforce, and focused solely on monitoring Facebook advertising for companies. “We’ve had huge interest, mostly from North America, which is our largest market,” Wolfram states. “We also have clients in Australia and around Europe, South America and Asia. Currently our biggest industries are entertainment, gaming and food and beverage. Most companies weren’t really aware of the problem, especially when we started.” Some of the more common situations would not be unfamiliar to frequent users of social media. For example, a post that has been scheduled in advance may suddenly insinuate something harmful when a dire news story breaks. ‘Piggybacking’ is also rampant, whereby a company uses another’s post as a platform for promoting its own products or services. “There are a lot of things that the brand or companies need to be aware of immediately,” Wolfram states. “Social media is existing 24/7; it’s hard for many companies to have in-house monitoring.” Growth has been rapid in the past few years for Wolfram and her international team. So much so that they recently expanded the service to Instagram and YouTube, and changed their name to BrandBastion. “The kind of threats that companies and people face on social media seem to be similar on most platforms,” Wolfram clarifies. “But Facebook is still our main platform, because that is where companies are spending most of their advertising money.” And so, it appears that businesses can now sleep soundly at night. Whatever the problem, BrandBastion guarantees to remove all harmful content in under eight minutes. “You have to be really fast, because on social media something can escalate in a few minutes,” Wolfram explains. A trajectory mirrored by BrandBastion’s upward swing, it seems."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tapp-commerce-develops-an-emerging-marketplace/,Tapp Commerce develops an emerging marketplace,"Whilst many people in developing countries are in possession of both cash and smartphones, an overwhelming number of them aren’t able to pay for goods or services online. Solving this problem with its peer-to-peer commerce network, this Finnish company is set to make bank. Given the ubiquity of smartphones in people’s pockets, it comes as no surprise to learn that the volume of mobile commerce transactions globally is expected to rise to 721 billion US dollars by 2017. This is up from 37.4 billion in 2009. Understandably a frenzy of fintech innovations has been clambering to enter the market. But, according to   CEO  , these fresh solutions are not meeting the basic need of end users in developing countries. “It doesn’t work because the solutions are all built around a banking infrastructure,” he observes. “Everyone is literally fighting over the same piece of real estate.” Tapp Commerce has racked up over one million US dollars worth of transactions in its first four months of operations in Indonesia. Tapp Commerce has set out to democratise the mobile marketplace, by connecting over two billion people worldwide without a bank account to commerce. “We provide an innovative peer-to-peer commerce network that allows parties to transact and move value between each other,” Sample explains. “This allows people without bank accounts or credit cards to use cash instead to pay for goods and services, by moving that value online.” An individual first downloads the app and then puts a deposit into the commerce network via a bank, ATM, convenience store or a local Tapp agent. They then become a mobile point of sale in the community. “This person can also play the role of ‘cash-in’, or mobile ATM, for moving other people’s value into the network,” Sample explains. The market doors are then open for everything from airtime, electricity and water, to music services and micro insurance via Tapp Commerce. Although it was established at the end of 2013, there’s a reason you may not have heard of the company – it is not yet operating in the Western world. However, the service is well and truly up and running, having racked up over one million US dollars worth of transactions in its first four months of operations in Indonesia. Indonesia’s population is 255 million people. Some 85 per cent of these have a mobile phone, but just four per cent own a credit card. Along with a rapidly growing middle class, it made sense to begin operations there. “If we can make it work in Indonesia, we can make it in other emerging markets,” Sample affirms. And so, Tapp Commerce is launching in the Philippines in January 2016. With its main office in Turku, located a vast distance away from the bustling marketplaces of South East Asia, Tapp Commerce has thus developed a local approach to facilitating its service. “A critical component to our success is our partnership between the Finland team and the local teams we establish,” Sample outlines. “All business is local at the end of the day, for sure, but Finland also brings with it a reputation for great transparency, trust and mobile knowhow, which helps us to enter the market.” Sample doesn’t see Tapp Commerce as a bank industry disrupter just as yet, more so it is simply filling the gap where the bank industry doesn’t currently exist. This is also a space where meaningful social aspirations and huge economic opportunity intertwine. “Tapp is here for good, meaning we are building a company for the long term,” he states. “But we are also a company that empowers the economic growth of our end users and leaves that value chain better off tomorrow than we found it today.” Tapp Commerce has set out to democratise the mobile marketplace, by connecting over two billion people worldwide without a bank account to commerce."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/happy-or-not-provides-feedback-one-smiley-at-a-time/,"HappyOrNot provides feedback, one smiley at a time","Gathering the opinions of customers and employees is now as easy as the push of a button. A good service experience can really make an impact on the way a customer sees a company, putting steps in place for repeat custom and also spreading positive word-of-mouth. The flip side of the coin is that a poorly executed interaction can have far reaching effects that can resonate for a long time afterwards. For  , a single moment he endured 20 years ago invariably set him on a path to founding  . “I was visiting a store and had a weird service experience,” the company’s CEO recalls. “Afterwards, I thought it would be great to have a device that could collect feedback from customers and then send this information to all relevant people.” However, rather than simply dive in and try his hand, Väänänen set out to develop himself first. “At that time I didn’t have any knowledge how to establish the company and how to scale globally,” he says. “So, I established a software company from 2002-2005 and then a mobile games company after this.” Along with gathering the required business and technical acumen, Väänänen was able to create a strong global network of customers. The foundations were now in place for kickstarting his grand plan. HappyOrNot operates in 70 countries and some of the world’s largest international companies are among its 2 000 customers. HappyOrNot grew quickly when it was founded in 2009, all the while wearing four deceptively straightforward faces. “Consumers press one of the four buttons on the HappyOrNot terminals,” Väänänen explains. “We collect all the data and provide a reporting service for our clients by email. We get so much feedback from consumers that we can create statistics that companies have never received before.” The scale of the company’s development means that Väänänen has not been handling everything just by himself. Far from it: he is joined by a growing group of 35 employees. “Many of us have a mobile gaming background,” Väänänen explains. “We learned that mobile games have to be fun to play. Basically it’s the same idea with Happy Or Not: everything has to be easy and simple for the client.” And it’s not just employee numbers that are on the up. HappyOrNot currently operates in 70 countries and some of the world’s largest international companies are among its 2 000 customers. “These include huge corporations like Carrefour, Ikea, the Kennedy Space Centre, Microsoft and so on,” Väänänen lists. “Also we have some really small clients, such as a single restaurant using our service, or a hospital. We are providing this service for many industries.” Whilst a majority of its customers are known, there are some that seek to remain undisclosed to the public in order to maintain their newly acquired competitive advantage. Väänänen hints at a number of significant agreements that have been signed, which will be revealed in due course. This ongoing international growth is all in keeping with the original plan that Väänänen forged all those years ago. “Our target for 2016 is roughly 10 million euros in sales,” he outlines. “Right now we are operating in Europe and the US, and we are starting operations in Asia as well.” HappyOrNot is also set to expand its portfolio. “We are doing some licensing in future,” Väänänen states. “We are also looking for technology partners and are really happy to discuss this with companies during the next 12 months.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/french-vc-firm-ventech-targets-nordics-with-finnish-expansion/,French VC firm Ventech targets Nordics with Finnish expansion,"In recent years the Nordic region has gained a veritable reputation as a hotbed for innovative startups. This reputation has now attracted also the first international venture capital (VC) company to set up office in Finland. Despite a vibrant startup scene boosted by global success stories such as Supercell, Rovio and Slush, Finland had missed the formal presence of a major international VC company. This changed in late 2015 as French investor   decided to expand its Sino-European operations into the Nordics with a dedicated Helsinki office. “If you look at the past few years, entrepreneurship and dynamism of tech startups have grown relatively more in Finland than any other Nordic country. That is one of the reasons why we chose Helsinki,” says  , a Finnish tech industry veteran who has been appointed as Ventech’s Nordic leader. “The idea is to cover the whole Nordic region from here.” Ventech also brings a major differentiator to the region. While Finnish investors mainly target early stage ventures, Ventech focuses particularly on high-growth startups looking for later stage (so called A and B round) funding. This means the company’s typical investment is between two and five million euros which can be increased to ten million euros over the lifetime of a venture. “There have not really been later stage investors in Finland,” explains Mennander. “In VC terms we talk about an ‘equity gap’. There is quite a lot of funding available for very early stage, especially seed stage, ventures…but then after the first investment it is fairly hard to find local investors to put in larger amounts into A or B rounds.” This is the gap Ventech plans to fill across the region. At the start its focus is mainly in Finland and Sweden while Denmark, Norway and the Baltics will be added gradually as the company’s Nordic operations grow. “There is plenty of technical and business know-how in Finland…but where the bottlenecks sometimes exist are [larger] funding and the small size of the home market,” says Tero Mennander. “Ventech wants to support fast internationalisation.” “We only invest in technology companies, but on a very wide scale from basic infrastructure and components to online marketplaces, web and mobile applications,” says Mennander. “These are all areas where the Nordics particularly have plenty of interesting things to offer.” In Finland Mennander highlights digital health, software, mobile and cloud expertise as strong sectors. He believes Finns easily match their American counterparts in technical and business skills and believes the local startup scene has benefitted from former Nokia employees pouring their know-how into new ventures. “There are plenty of potential investment targets in Finland,” Mennander explains. “The success of mobile gaming companies has been very visible in the news, but there is a lot more than that.” Ventech is not the only investor to spot this. While the VC firm prefers control over funding rounds, it does not rule out partnering with other local investors when they add value into a round. While Ventech’s Helsinki office is currently a one man operation, Mennander is far from alone in scouting potential investment targets. With a 25-year career in the tech sector (previously as the CEO of Finnish fitness tech company Pulse On) Mennander’s extensive contact network is being put to good use. “Ventech also does a lot of research and its analysts examine a variety of interesting sectors where there could be new business opportunities,” Mennander explains. “We then proactively look for companies which fit that bill.” Still being in the right sector is not enough to capture the interest of a major VC. Ventech also stresses the importance of scalability in its potential targets. A competitive product must have the ability to become a global brand backed by a strong core team and customer base. “Of course we look at the management team, that they have a suitable track record and expertise from that industry and market,” Mennander adds. “The third thing is a clear business plan and vision for how to proceed during the next two to three years. We will hone the business plan together, but the management needs to have their own strong vision on how the business should grow.” Follow these tips and you might just find yourself talking serious business with Mennander."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gold-green-foods-makes-vegetarianism-easily-digestible/,Gold&Green Foods makes vegetarianism easily digestible,"Finnish oats and beans combine to create an innovative and nutritious alternative to meat. Broccoli. Brussels sprouts. Peas. Why is the colour green associated with so many foods that youngsters refuse to eat? When   was a child she had a different approach: the food on her plate was quite often very green indeed. In fact, she struggles to remember a time in her life when she has ever consumed meat. “I don’t think I have been a vegetarian in the usual sense,” she recalls. “I just never had a reason to eat meat; I didn’t want to. I was 11 when I first heard there was a word for this, ‘vegetarian’.” Whilst this label was once something of a novelty, these days more than 50 per cent of people in Western countries consider themselves at least to be flexitarian: only occasionally enjoying animal-based products. The growing number of products in stores reflects this widespread enthusiasm for plant consumption. But, as shelves and freezers fill with new meat substitutes, all the while Itkonen has waited patiently for the arrival of an easy-to-prepare, flavoursome and nutritious option. “One meal saves you 2 000 litres of water – five bathtubs,” Maija Itkonen, CEO of Gold&Green enthuses. “Every meal matters.” And waited. So, as the old adage goes: if you want something done properly – do it yourself. Drawing on her background in consumer electronics innovation, Itkonen connected with her friend, food scientist PhD  , who in turn brought a team of scientists and researchers onboard from the University of Helsinki. The fruit of their collective labour can be playfully referred to as ‘pulled oats’. “To put it really simply, you could say that we have invented a new soy,” Itkonen states. “It’s a perfect protein based on Nordic ingredients.” Combining locally grown oats, fava beans and pea protein under the company name  , the pulled oats represent “the perfect nutritional composition.” Whilst large quantities of protein are difficult to digest, when combined with fibre the body is able to make short work of processing it. With any new product on the market it helps to have a hint of familiarity for cautious consumers. Alongside a plain-flavoured option, pre-seasonings of kaffir lime, sesame and ginger, or tomato, smoked pepper and coriander are available. The response has been very positive. In-store trials sold out in a few hours and production is being ramped up for widespread release in Finland as Q1 draws to a close. The remaining Nordic countries, along with the German and UK markets, are next in line. These pulled oats are merely the tip of the iceberg. Itkonen hints at a forthcoming range of energy bars, alongside plans for expanding their scope. “Our idea is not that we would just be a food factory, but more that we have the platform and technology,” she states. “We will produce some items ourselves and at the same time make it possible for our partners to start creating their own products.” Last year the World Health Organisation underlined the carcinogenic risk of consuming red meat and processed meat. Meanwhile, the environmental benefits of ‘going veg’ continue mounting up. Itkonen points out that six kilos of plant protein are used to produce one kilogram of animal protein, and “the seven gigatonnes of CO  produced by factory farming per year is higher than all transportation, even planes.” Abstaining from meat also significantly reduces the amount of water consumed during food production. “One meal saves you 2 000 litres of water – five bathtubs,” Itkonen enthuses. “Every meal matters.” Pulled oats are merely the tip of the iceberg. Gold&Green hints at a forthcoming range of energy bars, alongside plans for expanding their scope."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/persistence-pays-off-for-seepia-games/,Persistence pays off for Seepia Games,"After its first three games clocked up millions of downloads, this games studio aims to duplicate its success. Besides Helsinki, which Finnish cities would you say are most frequented by tourists? Turku? Tampere? Rovaniemi? Well, kudos to you if your list also contains Lappeenranta. Situated some 30 kilometres from the Russian border, this south-eastern city is a popular destination for visiting shoppers stocking up on a range of tax-free items. Given its geographical location approximately halfway between Helsinki and St Petersburg, Lappeenranta is sometimes referred to as the meeting place between the East and the West. Yet, for  , CEO of local mobile games company  , the city also represents a place where like-minded people come together. “There is a university here with a focus on international business and marketing,” he observes. “It is a big influence to have the right kind of people around to really start a company.” A software designer by trade, in 2012 Tietäväinen found himself surrounded by four others who shared his desire to make games. After some time spent tinkering with the concept, Seepia Games was born. “We have three things that we focus on: free-to-play multiplayer mobile games,” he states. “We love to create these products.” Seepia Games has since released three games on seven different platforms, with a combined total of 2.5 million downloads. Now, the studio is priming itself for the next level of gamesmanship, building on the success of its most innovative title, 2013’s  . Set in an original fantasy world, the first instalment of its turn-based collectible card game blended “mechanics from   with rock-paper-scissors elements”. Adding to the eclectic mix were archers, swordsmen, dinosaurs and dragons. What we showed to the world is only the tip of the iceberg. “We wanted to create something that is different from the typical ‘dwarves and elves’,” Tietäväinen states. “We are not strict with the usual stereotypes.” Their detailed work certainly did not go unnoticed. “It’s always a privilege to be able to play a game when it’s clear that the developers have put a lot of care and effort into it,” observed a review from tradingcardgames.com. Meanwhile, top ratings flooded in from everywhere from China to Brazil, the USA, Europe and Russia. “What we showed to the world is only the tip of the iceberg,” Tietäväinen admits. “Now, with    , we are trying to unleash the potential of the game. Almost everything changes. The one thing that will stay the same is the core gameplay.” Whilst no release date has been locked in, Tietäväinen assures fans chomping at the bit that a second helping of   will be available at some stage this year. Whatever the date, the one thing that remains unchanged for players is Seepia Games’ core philosophy. “We want to be a games studio that our customers can rely on with the content we provide,” he states. “What is common with our games is they are always a little different than other products on the market. We are not producing a direct copy of trending games.” Offering something new doesn’t extend to altering their free-to-play approach – the Seepia Games crew still refuses to create any financial restrictions to players’ initial enjoyment. “We are trying to find different kinds of ways for people to interact with the game,” Tietäväinen states. “They should not have to pay because they want to play, but only if they want to make the experience richer, or they want to progress quickly. It should be possible to play as much as they want.” Seepia Games is priming itself for the next level of gamesmanship, building on the success of its most innovative title, 2013’s Permia – Duels.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-zyptonite-brings-privacy-to-video-calls/,Finnish startup Zyptonite brings privacy to video calls,"Born out of frustration with unreliable, insecure video calling services, Zyptonite believes it has found a better way. Keeping touch with family and friends abroad has never been easier. Unfortunately it also often goes hand-in-hand with pixelated video image and muffled sound. These are exactly the issues new technology startup Zyptonite promises to put to rest. “  is the first real-time communications app that connects parties directly,” says  , co-founder and CEO of Zyptonite. “People need a simple, reliable and free video call and messenger service that works on different devices and operating systems without problems.” On the surface Zyptonite offers the same features as many similar internet-based services, but it is what is under the hood which sets the app apart. Typically, Internet calls travel through servers in a data centre before reaching the recipient in the other end, but Zyptonite has simplified this process. The startup cut out the server and built its service on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, which is more familiar to most from file sharing services. “There is no server or anything between [those who are talking]. The data comes straight from my device to your device and if we both use a computer, it comes from my browser to your browser and we do not need to install any software,” explains Uusiheimala. According to Uusiheimala and his fellow Zyptonite co-founder, Finnish security expert  , this makes the connection not only more reliable but also improves quality and security even in areas of weaker networks. In fact Zyptonite will automatically resume a call even if the internet connection drops, removing the need to redial. Zyptonite uses peer-to-peer technology where data is not stored. The startup believes this will appeal not only to anyone worried about their own privacy, but to professionals dealing with sensitive information. It might sound risky to go against global tech giants such as the Microsoft-owned Skype and Google Hangouts, but Zyptonite is confident it has the right aces up its sleeve. In addition to improved connectivity, video and sound quality the startup also promises to offer greater levels of privacy. Since the data only moves between the sender and the receiver, it is not saved anywhere. In practice this means there is no risk of someone being able to access or steal the data. “It is the same thing as we would experience talking face to face. After the words have been said, they do not exist anywhere else,” says Uusiheimala. “I do not have to trust a service provider to keep my data secure or not to share it with anyone, because it is not saved anywhere.” Consequently Zyptonite is not only targeted at consumers looking for better quality for their video calls, but at anyone concerned about their privacy. Uusiheimala particularly highlights companies and professionals handling sensitive information, including doctors, lawyers and journalists. This lack of data collection also means Zyptonite cannot charge for its service on a usage basis or sell targeted advertising. Therefore the basic service is free and the startup is working on introducing premium features, such as instant transfer of large files, which could be unlocked for a fee. Zyptonite has grown quickly. A year ago the service was barely an idea, but now it has hit public beta with a browser client and Android app while an iOS app is due to follow shortly. Meanwhile Zyptonite has expanded its team to 12 members split between Helsinki and New York.  I do not have to trust a service provider to keep my data secure or not to share it with anyone, because it is not saved anywhere. “We have four people in Finland who are in charge of development. We are hiring at least one more developer there, maybe more,” says Uusiheimala who has split his time between Finland and the US for the last 15 years. Zyptonite has also raised nearly 400 000 euros of private funding to support its launch in the US and other English language markets. Plans for other language versions are in the pipeline, but for now the company’s focus remains on making a service people like and want to use. In a world where major data breaches, government snooping and cyber attacks have become everyday news, Zyptonite certainly has the potential to catch the imagination. “We aim to bring back people’s trust on privacy, it is still possible,” Uusiheimala concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/valossa-takes-video-search-to-the-next-level-with-ai/,Valossa takes video search to the next level with AI,"Looking for that movie where Sean Connery wears red trousers? Or romantic comedies set in Hawaii? Finnish startup Valossa offers a new way to find video content with a combination of voice control and deep content analysis. Talking to a device is no longer a sign of frustration. Voice control first appeared on our smartphones and now is increasingly used to search for movie and TV content on our Smart TVs and set-top boxes. However it is not a tech industry giant but a 10-person startup from Finland,  , that claims to have taken voice-operated video searches to a whole new level. The company’s flagship product, video search engine titled ‘Valossa Search’, enables users to find video content using complex, descriptive natural language queries. “A person can use their own natural language when talking to a device,” explains  , chief commercial officer at Valossa. “If you say ‘find me a movie where a boy learns he is a wizard’, our technology can process this and find the specific results. In this case the first   movie, not the second or third one.” Behind this search prowess is Valossa’s artificial intelligence (AI) powered technology. It analyses the contents of a video file or a live stream using a combination of language and pattern recognition. The service can identify over one thousand concepts, including places, people, emotions and objects, and turn them into searchable data. Welcome news to anyone who struggles to remember movie titles. “Video search engines traditionally rely on metadata [such as keywords and names] that has been manually added by people. Our technology can automatically find descriptive terms, the metadata, from video content without any kind of human interaction,” Hulkko says. According to Valossa’s tests, its search engine can be as much as 10 times more effective in finding movies based on people’s descriptions than current commercial movie services, including the likes of Youtube Movies and Amazon Prime Instant Video. While Valossa was officially founded only in October, it is built on strong roots. The technology is based on years of research by company CEO  at the University of Oulu in Northern Finland. This work culminated in a successful analysis of over 300 000 live digital TV broadcasts for Finnish national broadcaster Yle. Valossa’s voice-controlled video search supports not only descriptive, but continuous queries. A question like ‘show me nonviolent movies with animals’ can be followed by saying ‘only the ones with elephants’. Now Valossa believes the time is right to take its search engine into commercial use. The startup has its sights set on video content providers, on-demand services and device manufacturers – especially in the US. “It is a cold fact in our industry that you have to be in the US. The markets and all the players are there,” says Hulkko who himself moved to San Francisco in August to build local presence for Valossa. “If you are not present in the US market, they have hard time to think of you as a worthwhile player.“ The startup says it is currently in discussions with a few major companies regarding the implementation of Valossa Search, but cannot yet reveal any names. As Hulkko puts it, entering a new market is a dance where the big players lead and a small company has to choose its steps carefully. It seems Valossa has chosen its steps well. The company started its US-expansion by winning the Silicon Valley based Start Pitch competition in October and in December secured 650 000 US dollars in seed funding from Butterfly Ventures and Finnish angel investors. Although voice-controlled video search is Valossa’s main product, it is not the only card in the company’s pocket. Namely Valossa is working on real-time content analysis and cooperation with advertising technology companies for contextual advertising. “What we are planning now is analysis of live TV broadcasts where we automatically recognise key terms from the live feed. This means we can link relevant ads into the video content or we can produce descriptive metadata for interested parties,” Hulkko explains. Constant development of new features is key for Valossa. Hulkko believes the need for innovative voice-powered technologies will only grow as augmented reality and smart glasses, which lack traditional touch interfaces, slowly become part of our everyday lives. “We want our technology to become an industry standard for voice-controlled video searches,” Hulkko says. “As AI keeps developing we would like to see all video analysis have a piece of our AI technology in it.” In the future according to Valossa, there will be nothing strange about speaking to the devices around us. And if they work as well as the company promises, we will believe that."

Finns seem to love everything related to winter and snow and this is taken to the extremes at the ‘coolest startup competition in the world’. The aptly named   sees startup entrepreneurs take turns to jump in an ice hole and sell their business idea to a jury of industry experts and investors. This year 20 pre-selected finalists took on the challenge of freezing water in Oulu, Northern Finland, where the event took place last week. The Polar Bear Pitching competition was opened by both the US and Canadian ambassadors to Finland taking a dip in the icy water. Canadian ambassador Andrée Noëlle Cooligan pictured. “I was thinking this is your moment, better do it well. There was almost one blackout moment [of not remembering what to say], but you just have remember to breathe calmly,“ laughs  , who was the first finalist to brave the hole cut in the sea ice. Kauppinen kept her cool and spent over two minutes in the water presenting her company  , that is tapping into the superfood trend with a series of gel shots for energy, endurance and improving resistance to colds. All products are made out of Arctic berries and herbs, such as nettle and roseroot, without any artificial ingredients. While the shots are already sold by 300 retailers in Finland, Arctic Warriors is now starting to look at international markets which attracted Kauppinen to Polar Bear Pitching. In addition to networking opportunities at the event itself, the competition was live streamed to international audiences and event studios organised by startup communities in 11 countries, including Cambodia and Gambia. Now in its third year, Polar Bear Pitching has expanded to a two day event with Arctic team races (such as husky rides and skiing) and workshops in addition to the pitching competition. The event is targeted at early stage startups ranging from new concepts to companies looking for their first seed funding round. CEO Miia Liesegang braved the elements to present Belightful’s designer butterfly feeder. A case in example is Oulu-based  . The startup was founded a year ago on the realisation of the growing need for affordable temporary housing, not only in ever expanding cities but in crises areas. Cube 3.3’s answer has been to design a modular, movable microhouse made out of seamless composites and a durable, safe emergency shelter with an elevated floor. “We have the prototypes ready and are testing them in outdoor use,” says  , CEO at Cube 3.3. “Now we are looking for funding and partners.” Both the startup’s products are cost-efficient and easy to transport. Potential usages include building sites and refugee camps, basically anywhere barracks or tents are now used. At a similar stage is another Finnish finalist looking to solve a topical problem,  . It is building a hybrid generator which offers a sustainable and reliable power supply aimed primarily at developing countries where lack of electricity is a frequent problem. The generator will have an inbuilt energy storage system, a plugin possibility for multiple energy sources and a controller which enables power usage optimisation. “At the moment we have the software and we have the controllers which are the brains of the whole machine, but not the components yet,” explains   from Fineria. The startup, which was founded by a team of university students, saw Polar Bear Pitching as a great opportunity to find partners to help finalise and internationalise the product. Fineria will initially target Nigeria, where three of its founders were born. But Polar Bear Pitching isn’t only for Finnish companies. In fact, the furthest startup application came for Kenya while the winning pitch was by Norwegian Flowmotion Technologies. The startup took home a 10 000 euro cash prize and a professional services package of the same value. Flowmotion impressed the jury not only with a backflip into the icy water, performed by its VP of Marketing  but by promising to get rid of shaky videos. Behind this is Flowstick, a robust motorised stabiliser for Go Pro cameras for which the startup will soon launch a crowdfunding campaign. “Flowmotion’s pitch was very successful both in its content and the performance. It convinced from the first seconds and immediately captured the attention of the jury,“ says  , chairman of the competition jury and founder of the Catapult incubator. “All twenty pitches showed amazing attitude.” With plans already in place for next year’s event it is time to start practising that attitude. Leirimaa is happy to share the secret to his own training: “[The pitching] was actually easier than I thought. I practiced by filling my bathtub with water and snow which was much worse than this.” Norwegian Flowmotion Technologies took home the first prize at this year’s Polar Polar Bear Pitching competition.The startup has developed a stabilising device for Go Pro cameras."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/agras-distillery-finds-inspiration-from-fiskars-flavours/,Ägräs Distillery finds inspiration from Fiskars’ flavours,"Finland’s iconic hub of creativity is flush with a growing number of finely crafted beverages. For those who came in late, the mention of Fiskars may conjure up images of its most well known export: the distinctive orange-handled scissors that bear the name of this village of 600 inhabitants. In fact plenty has been happening here, some 100 kilometres west of Helsinki, since this phenomenon went global. “There actually hasn’t been a scissors industry here since the ‘70s,” informs  , Fiskars Villager of the Year 2015 and partner at  . “Now Fiskars is mostly known for artisans and handcrafts; lots of cabinetmakers and carpenters.” This change of focus is all part and parcel of the town’s rich, undulating history; one that continues to evolve. “Fiskars was actually one of the biggest mining industries in the area over 300 years ago,” Kankare explains. “Nowadays our target is to be the biggest handcrafted alcohol village in Finland.” Things are certainly in place for this future success. Whilst much has changed for Fiskars over the centuries, the one constant has been the keenly felt presence of the woods surrounding the village. Here a wide palate of pure, innovative flavours can be found among the close-knit trunks of birch and pine trees. “The biggest thing for us is the local wild herbs, which we hand-pick,” observes Ägräs Distillery COO and co-founder  . “These are perfect ingredients for distilling beverages.” In fact, such are their importance to the village’s first ever distillery, that Ägräs actually takes its name from the ancient Finnish god of nature and abundance. Scotsman Kenneth McMaster tracks down the best flavours of the Fiskars region. Ägräs Distillery represents a natural continuation of Leinonen’s flavoursome work with beverage creation, after establishing Fiskars’s Rekola Brewery four years ago. “From the start of the brewery my partners and I thought about putting up the distillery,” Leinonen explains. “Then we found  , the wild herb collector, who gathered some herbs and hops for our wild beer collection.” Certainly, given the fact that Scotland is the undisputed whisky capital of the world, it mustn’t hurt to now have this expat Scot involved when operating a distillery, right? McMaster’s importance to the enterprise is even proudly stated on their website: his “natural talent for finding and utilising nature’s best flavours is Ägräs’ proprietary secret we are holding on to with both hands.” Yet, interestingly, McMaster’s herbalist skills have actually enabled a somewhat unexpected focus for the enterprise. “Because we are heading globally straight away, we thought we would have aquavit on the frontline, not whiskey,” Leinonen outlines. Tipped to be the next big trend worldwide, this northern gin gains its distinct flavour from an infusion of herbs and spices. Those licking their lips in anticipation can start counting down the days on their calendar. Ägräs’ first drop is scheduled to be uncorked around Christmas this year. By then, the collaborative nature of the project will have extended beyond the distillery’s five-person team. Fiskars’ glassblowers are being called on to create Ägräs’ bottles and glasses, and local carpenters the furniture of its tasting room. Yet, for all of the joint effort among the villagers, it will be that other thing that comes naturally to Fiskars that truly defines the beverages created by Ägräs. “The biggest thing for the distillery is to present some new flavour combinations to the people,” Leinonen outlines. “These flavours come from Finnish nature. It is the thing that drives me towards succeeding in the big time.” Fiskars village’s distillery, Ägräs has taken its name from the ancient Finnish god of nature and abundance."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/learning-is-the-game-plan-for-keeduu/,Learning is the game plan for Keeduu,"This new Finnish learning solution is bringing primary school education into the digital age of game play. Around four years ago teacher and vice principal  was faced with a challenge: showing her fellow educators how to use tablets in the classroom. With students in grades three to six far more comfortable with the devices than their instructors, the digital age was increasingly leaving many in its wake. “There was a quite huge gap between teachers and children,” she recalls. “I also realised that if you want to have a good digital lesson, you need to have several teaching tools. This is where I got the idea for  .” Bringing together textbooks, videos, assignments, educational exercises and a game, Keeduu seeks to cover all bases in the one concise and convenient digital package. “Learning is based on two things,” explains Keeduu’s Mari Kilpeläinen. “You have to think and make something your own, then you have to repeat this if you want to gain some skills.” Based in the eastern city of Joensuu, Keeduu is the first offering from e-and mobile learning startup Kasauma Education Ltd. Developed by Kilpeläinen, the company’s founder and CEO, and a growing team, Keeduu draws on Finnish educational expertise in order to meet pupils’ needs. So, what does this involve, exactly? After being introduced to the theory relevant for each lesson via a textbook page, students sit back and enjoy an educational video on the same topic. Then it’s time to embark upon a range of related assignments that actively engage students and require them to produce their own content. Keeduu’s metaphorical cherry on top is a game set in a virtual island milieu. In fact it is more like an ongoing series of dangling carrots, each of which encouraging the progression of children’s learning. “If they want to advance in the game, students have to complete exercises,” Kilpeläinen states. “Problem-solving tasks include fishing and collecting algae, and trading these for other tools and equipment. You need money for this, which you get by doing exercises.” According to Kilpeläinen, Keeduu successfully addresses the fallacy that learning games should merely involve children repeating something  . “Learning is based on two things,” she explains. “You have to think and make something your own, then you have to repeat this if you want to gain some skills.” Keeduu’s metaphorical cherry on top is a game set in a virtual island milieu. She illustrates this more succinctly by using one of life’s most common early challenges. “If you want to learn how to ride a bike, first you have to think how to do it and then you just have to practise.” In the years leading up to its recent launch, Keeduu was tested in 20 schools around Finland. “The response has been really good,” Kilpeläinen says. “Teachers like it; it’s easy for them to use. They don’t need separate clouds, for example, as there is everything in the one app. Children love it; they find it easy to learn.” Now, with Keeduu bridging the digital gap between generations, there is plenty of room left on the shelf for expanding the gamification of the education system in future. “We think it is very useful for other markets too,” Kilpeläinen says. “In the future we will make more games and more modules around it. But now we are looking for partners to go international.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/eevia-provides-arctic-bounty-to-the-world/,Eevia provides Arctic bounty to the world,"Foods, nutritional supplements and even cosmetics are enriched by the far north’s unique natural resources. A century ago the Sami writer   published details of the Arctic region’s traditional medicine. He described the use of pine bark, lichen and fungi, among many other natural ingredients. The Sami knew what they were doing: modern science has proven the efficacy of many of these plants. Now the Finnish company   is providing this natural bounty to the world. Eevia is based in Seinäjoki, Finland and specialises in the extraction of bioactive compounds from berries and plants. Some of their raw materials include young pine bark and the chaga fungus commonly found on birch trees. Eevia also has expertise in berries, such as the lingonberry, cloudberry, bilberry (Nordic wild blueberry) and black currant. “Most of our clients are in the nutritional supplement, cosmetic and food industries,” says  , head of Eevia’s R&D. “We do a lot of business domestically but we are also aggressively expanding internationally. We have distributor agreements in South Africa, South Korea, Germany, France, the UK and other countries. We aim to have 80-90 per cent of our business to be exports within two or three years.” Some of Eevia’s raw materials include young pine bark that can be used for nutritional supplements or liquid extracts for health drinks. Some Arctic plants have already been studied extensively. Bilberries are popularly called a superfood and studies have examined if they can lower the risk of heart attacks, combat high blood pressure, improve memory, lower cancer risks and even improve eyesight. Less well-known Arctic plants are also being studied. “We call it bioprospecting,” Lackman continues. “We get raw materials and screen for active ingredients. We analyse them to see what compounds work. If it looks good it goes into product development. Right now we have teamed up with the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes to research key ideas and we are in the process of filing patent applications. I’m quite excited about what we have coming.” Eevia processes the plants to extract the active compounds and create powders or liquids. They might be put into capsules and tablets for nutritional supplements, or creams for cosmetics, or liquid extracts for health drinks. “Finland’s northern regions are much better for our business than other Arctic areas around the world,” says Lackman. “We have the infrastructure such as roads and we also have the northern population. We have people there with the local knowledge, people who know where to find these plants and how to pick them. In some places in Canada, for instance, you have few people and few roads.” Eevia is one of a growing number of Finnish firms focusing on the new bioeconomy. This utilises biological resources in food, energy and other products. The Finnish forestry industry has developed wood pellets for fuels and new wood-based materials to replace plastics created with petroleum. Eevia works closely with the forestry industry – particularly for their pine bark products – and Lackman is excited at what he is seeing. “I’m very happy with the interest in this new industry,” he says. “We have Finnish universities doing great science on our natural resources. The government understands how important the bioeconomy will be and is supporting its development. And we at Eevia have something new coming soon which I’m sure will be a big hit.” Finland’s northern regions are suitable for business due to developed infrastructure such as wide road network."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/investoreye-adds-social-dimension-to-investor-communications/,InvestorEye adds social dimension to investor communications,"For many companies, managing investor relations means unilateral communications, which may turn into a strategic pitfall. On the other hand, small-scale investors often find it difficult to locate easily understandable investment information on companies. Investoreye offers a tool that solves both of these problems.  Different-sized companies are faced with different challenges when it comes to investor communications. Not nearly all major listed companies gain media visibility, which means that there are many companies on the Helsinki stock exchange whose shares are hardly traded at all. Startup companies are not faced with the issue of investor communications until they are in desperate need of money. “The companies then frantically visit all sorts of events, selling their idea. Investor communications should be much longer term and ongoing: basically, companies should never stop pitching to keep investors’ interest alive. In the end, it’s about marketing; only, rather than a product, the item marketed is ownership in the company,” says  . Kuittinen knows exactly what she is talking about. She is the CEO of a FinTech startup named  . The service developed by InvestorEye is targeted at bringing together companies and small-scale investors. “InvestorEye is a tool that allows companies to target investment information at private investors,” Kuittinen explains. “As far as listed companies go, small-scale investors are in a fairly unfavourable position when it comes to receiving information and reacting to it. We want to improve the situation for the average consumer.” InvestorEye is a browser or mobile based app that investors can use free of charge when searching for information on companies as investees. The service encompasses both listed companies and growth companies, for example. The service allows companies to handle their investor communications proactively and quickly, for example, by answering the direct questions of investors. Laura Kuittinen points out that investor communications should be a much more long-term and ongoing process for unlisted companies as well. The companies joining the service are charged a small fee which is determined by the number of investors that they reach with their message. If no one listens, there is no need to pay. Real-timeness and socialness are two of InvestorEye’s important attributes. Despite the fact that social media has gained popularity in almost all of the other areas of corporate communications, its opportunities are still largely underutilised in investor communications. That is why InvestorEye’s goal is to add a social dimension also to investor relations. The tool, launched in 2015, is unique in the world, according to Kuittinen. Of course, there are services that assist institutional investors in making investments. However, these services are a far cry from the reality of small-scale investors and offer little help to small-sized listed companies. “Those listed companies that do not gain visibility are also unattractive to large-scale investors, who find them to be too small as investees,” Kuittinen explains. The service has already attracted users – both companies and investors. According to the market survey conducted by InvestorEye, 65 per cent of Nordic companies welcome this type of service with open arms. Some would be ready to jump in right away, while others prefer to wait and see what happens to those who were the first to join. Investoreye has never perceived Finland as a single market; it has had its sights set on the Nordic countries from the get-go. This spring, the company is heading for Central Europe. Kuittinen has a background in the banking sector. Currently she works full-time at InvestorEye. “I worked for 13 years in a bank, largely dealing with matters that had already been prepared by others and using processes that had been specified in great detail. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of being an entrepreneur has been the freedom of choice – quite often you have to make decisions based on incomplete information and common sense. On the other and, freedom is also the best aspect of entrepreneurship,” Kuittinen says. Evidently, she has made the right choices. Headquartered in the small town of Riihimäki in Southern Finland, InvestorEye today employs six people full time. The company’s future is planned out: “We want to be the world’s number one in investor relations communications tools. We do see that there is also room for other players on the markets, but we intend to be the market leader and the top-of-mind company in this sector,” Kuittinen says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/five-finnish-bioeconomy-innovations-set-to-change-the-future/,Five Finnish bioeconomy innovations set to change the future,"It has been calculated that, as a result of population growth, the Earth will require 50 per cent more food, 45 per cent more energy and 30 per cent more water by the year 2030. Solutions to future challenges are thus being sought in the bioeconomy. Finland has turned towards a low-carbon and energy-efficient society that is based on the use of renewable natural resources and recyclable materials. A country that has access to a large supply of renewable natural resources and technology expertise has what it takes to become a model country for the bioeconomy. Below, we present five Finnish bioeconomy innovations that are harbingers of the future. The plastic bags that are currently used as shopping bags originated in the 1960s and today 100 billion plastic bags are used annually in Europe alone. A plastic bag can take up to 500 years to decompose. All of the plastic manufactured to date is thus still part of the cycle, burdening our oceans and nature. The wood fibre material with plastic-like characteristics, developed by the Finnish startup company Paptic, aims to make plastic bags a thing of the past. Paptic’s wood-based technology, developed with VTT’s help over the course of seven years, can be used to replace plastic films in bags and packages. So far, the company has succeeded in creating a bag that is up to 70 per cent renewable and biodegradable and 100 per cent recyclable. The startup raised a total of 1.1 million euros in its first investment round last year. Population growth also means a future increase in mobility and the reliance of the traffic network on fossil fuels is not sustainable. In order to become sustainable, road traffic needs renewable energy solutions. What if, instead of drilling for oil, fuel could be produced from trees? This is no longer a vision of the future: the raw material for   is tall oil manufactured from a pulp production residue. Made in Finland from mainly domestic raw material, the renewable diesel can be used in all diesel engines. UPM Bioverno is manufactured from crude tall oil, which is obtained mainly from fir trees as a residue of pulp production. UPM’s renewable diesel can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional fossil diesel. Wood is a versatile material, which can even be used to cast a broken arm. The Finnish company Onbone has developed the Woodcast, which is manufactured from wood and biodegradable plastic. It is non-toxic and easily moldable without water or rubber gloves. The Woodcast is suitable for all types of casting and for the manufacture of braces for sprains, strains and various types of osteoarthritis. The cast was launched in 2010 and is now used in all Finnish hospitals and around the world. Last year,   for the global launch of the Woodcast casting and splinting products. Currently, the clothing industry uses as its raw materials mainly oil-based artificial fibres and cotton, which consumes large volumes of water. Finding alternatives to the fibre-based material used in textile processes is essential as the production volumes of cotton cannot continue growing due to the volumes of water and cultivation area it demands. Cotton and viscose can soon be forgotten because Aalto University, the University of Helsinki and   a new type of process that turns wood cellulose into textile fibre. The Ioncell fibre is an ecological alternative to cotton and its manufacture is free of the toxic chemicals used in, for example, traditional viscose production. The research results also show that particularly birch wood yields a cellulose fibre that exceeds even cotton and viscose in terms of material strength. Ioncell may be seen in industrial use within a few years. The fibre innovation received an award  , which seek ideas to support sustainable development in the textile industry. The chemical industry plays a key role in developing the bioeconomy. Industry companies are involved throughout the biomass process cycle from the manufacture of fertilisers needed for biomass cultivation all the way through to refining biowaste. Kemira is a good example of bioeconomy research. The company’s research centre has long been focused on developing water chemistry, which has resulted in the FennoClean PFA compound. It keeps paper machines clear of microbes but the end-product non-toxic and safe. FennoClean PFA does not contain any chlorine, which is commonly used in ensuring microbiological process cleanliness and runnability in tissue manufacture. Instead of chlorine, FennoClean PFA’s effectiveness is based on a natural combination of formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. As a chlorine-fee compound, the biodegradable PFA quickly kills bacteria and then decomposes into carbon dioxide and water. PFA is also a compound that improves corrosion safety, reducing paper machine repair costs and web breaks, which improves the productivity of mills and simultaneously reduces their ecological footprint."

In 2013 it topped Deloitte’s list as the fastest growing technology company in Finland and today Iloq employs 60 people in Finland and its main growth markets of the Nordics, Germany and Holland. Most of Aava’s clients come from the US, Europe and Japan which include systems providers and some of the world’s largest tablet manufacturers. Not many recognise the name Aava Mobile, although the company’s tablets and handheld devices can be found in stores and factories around the world. Founded in 2009, Aava develops rugged mobile devices which can be easily modified with different modules, such as payment terminals, for a whole variety of enterprise use. “We make enterprise class devices which can handle water, dust and being dropped” says  , COO of Aava. “They are similar to consumer products, but can be used in point-of-sales, warehouses or when climbing a utility pole.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/apped-transforms-working-culture-with-fun-business-apps/,Apped transforms working culture with fun business apps,"Finnish startup Apped bypasses IT integrations to make business applications enjoyable and effective. Gaming graphics, cute characters and funny animations are not typically associated with business applications. But these are exactly what Helsinki-based startup Apped believes corporations need today to break needless routines and increase work wellbeing and productivity. “Our apps do not look anything like Excel or other traditional business software,” says  , co-founder and CEO of  , with a laugh. “Our idea is to produce mobile services in a new way. We bypass the typical [IT] headaches related to business apps and bring a truly consumer-like mobile experience to them.” In practice this means using game-like visual elements, swipe and tap functionality and placing extra focus on ease-of-use. Where business apps typically require heavy technical integration with existing systems, anyone can download Apped’s apps from public app stores. Type in your work email and the app directly and securely connects with corporate systems and is ready for use. “There are tonnes of business applications available. According to some reports, every week 45 human resources [HR] applications alone are published in the Apple App Store,” says Lindberg. “What truly sets us apart is the ease of implementation. You don’t need to do a single call to the IT department to start using our apps.” Lindberg is not alone in trusting the potential of Apped’s unique approach. The 12-month-old startup has raised over one million euros in funding and attracted Finnish IT heavyweights, including former Microsoft Finland CEO  , to its board of directors. Apped’s first mobile application practices what the startup preaches. Published in late 2015, Apped Pulse is a real-time employee ‘mood’ and wellbeing monitoring tool. Instead of the traditional way of filling in annual surveys, anyone can use the app to rate their day, share their feelings on a particular topic or ask their colleagues to share their thoughts. CEO Peter Lindberg promises that you don’t need to do a single call to the IT department to start using Apped’s apps. “We wanted to create a real-time pulse monitor where the employees themselves, not only the management, can start surveys when they want to know, for instance, what others think about a certain issue,” Lindberg explains. Lindberg says Pulse, which was piloted with media corporation Sanoma before the official launch, has been well received. Furthermore, while Apped mainly targets large corporations, Pulse has also attracted users from medium-size companies and public sector organisations, such as municipalities and universities. “Operational effectiveness and work wellbeing seem to be very topical issues in this sectors,” Lindberg comments. But Pulse is just the start for Apped. The startup wants to create a portfolio of apps that help companies kill time-consuming routines and become more productive. Next in the pipeline are apps for personal time management and improving meeting culture. The latter, called Apped Meetz, makes it easy to schedule and set goals for short five-minute meetings. Like Apped’s other apps, Meetz also provides benchmarking information to see how things stand in the user’s organisation. While Apped is currently focused on the Finnish market, its ambitions are global. Apped has set up a dormant company in the US ready for the startup to cross the Atlantic once its user base grows large enough. “Our goal is to reach 10 000 users this spring and have at least a few big Finnish corporations to adopt the service, then target New York,” Lindberg explains. “The logical reason is that when you look at Europe, Finland is the most developed market for cloud services and New York is a similar area within the US.” Apped is not planning to take on the global markets alone. It is building a partner strategy around its mobile platform which it hopes in future will grow into a wider ecosystem. Lindberg says several major software companies and operators are already interested in adding Apped’s services into their own customer offering. “There is our technological side, which is revolutionary in its own way, but then there is our vision on how work life is being disrupted and people increasingly want to use mobile devices to support their work,” Lindberg says. “This is where I would like to see us lead the market already in a few years’ time.” With Apped’s Pulse application employees and directors can start surveys about issues important for them."

The idea to form the association came about in 2012 when the founders, all entrepreneurs, noticed that there were no grass roots driven initiatives for startups to connect with the rest of the health ecosystem. HealthSPA was also born on the premise that it could “bring forward the industry as a whole, connect investors, media, large corporates and industry experts,” Salonius describes. The association is funded by private and public means and runs on a non-profit basis. “We want to see Finland as the hotspot for health-tech and during the last four years we have really seen that taking place,” Salonius explains and adds that, “four years ago nobody talked about the health industry from an entrepreneur’s perspective”. HealthSPA seeks to provide the means to give every health startup the best chance of succeeding in Finland by connecting all the different areas of the health industry. By facilitating investment in health tech, Healthspa is ensuring that healthcare throughout the world will ultimately improve. Upgraded Life Festival is a yearly event organised by HealthSPA. It aims to provide a place for the whole health ecosystem, from startups to investors, to meet on a large scale. Netmedi was founded in 2012 by a group of software developers, including Henri Virtanen (left), Otto Seiskari, Kaarlo Haikonen, Lauri Sippola and Joel Lehikoinen. With over 950 in attendance in 2015,  , the main organiser of the event expects over 1 000 people to the festival this year. The event is organised for startups, medical professionals, corporations, researchers and other forerunners in heath. Ultimately the target of the event is to gather all the different sectors of the health ecosystem to learn and build together. International investment is something that HealthSPA is eager to get on board. “That’s what Upgraded Life Festival is for: to attract international companies to see what health innovations are growing in Finland and what a developed ecosystem we have,” says Vartia. According to Salonius, it can be difficult for Finnish companies to get recognition on international markets until they have reference customers. This is something that HealthSPA aims to improve by being able to connect the industry. Developed by Netmedi,  , which means ‘echo’ in Finnish, connects patients and healthcare workers in the area of oncology. Netmedi has benefited greatly from the services that HealthSPA provides by swiftly becoming a European leader in health-related digital communication. Kaiku has been created with the help of patients and professionals, and hopes to break down the barriers of communication between cancer patients and their doctors. The online platform guides a cancer patient through treatment and recovery, while helping their care team improve the treatment process by getting up-to-date data about the patient’s wellbeing. “There are many things that need to be monitored from the patients during and after the treatment,” describes  , Netmedi’s head of operations. “It is very important to follow any possible adverse effects and the quality of life of a patient. Patients also have many other questions during their treatments.” Kaiku aims to reduce the time and resources needed to check in on patients. In the traditional follow-up, when all communication is done on the phone or in person, there will always be a period of time in-between where the patient is not being monitored. Kaiku is being used by both private and public hospitals around Finland, Sweden and also in four of the top oncology units in Europe, based in Switzerland. “As cancer treatments evolve and are being tested it’s very important that there are quicker follow-ups between the patient and the medical staff,” Virtanen explains. “It is important that hospitals can target their resources for the patients whose situation requires it the most.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/epic-owl-flies-high-in-mobile-gaming/,Epic Owl flies high in mobile gaming,"Over the last few years, Finland has been making waves in the mobile gaming industry with Rovio and Supercell leading the way.  Now a new company has joined the fold in continuing that tradition, with its debut game Starside Arena.  was founded in 2014 by a group of Rovio employees who followed their own agenda, as CEO   explains: “There were some strategy decisions made in Rovio back in 2014 that we didn’t fully agree on and there were some cancellations of our game projects within the company.” The company has a saying that “The Game comes First”, which means that the gameplay is developed upon before any characters or worlds are created. The group is small and agile meaning that important decisions are made right away and the company has a particular niche audience that they want to focus on creating games for. “There are lots of small mobile gaming companies and there will always be a centre of mobile gaming here in Finland,” says Epic Owl CEO Juha Vainio. The idea for  has been there since the foundations of the company. “We wanted to make a space themed builder battler,” Vainio recalls. “The basic design was a concept that we started prototyping and it turned out quite nice.” The company was able to attract funding in the early stages of the game’s development from Sisu Game Ventures as well as providing their own money to the company. However there is currently no other outside funding for the company to obtain on the horizon, “We’ve been trying to find extra funding for about six months,” he admits, “but it hasn’t been very easy. Finland’s gaming industry has been on the rise since the successes of Rovio’s   and Supercell’s  , but the roots of the gaming industry lay in the early ’90s demo scene. “Lots of kids started making demos and that’s where it’s speculated that the Finnish gaming scene started,” says Vainio. Also Nokia had its share in developing Finland’s gaming market: “Nokia put lots of money in games and that’s when many of the small gaming companies got started.” Recently, there has been a movement of Finnish gaming companies wanting to develop virtual reality gaming for devices such as the Oculus Rift and the PlayStation 4’s VR headset, but the move might not be ruled out for Epic Owl. “We are very enthusiastic but I think we want to see the first wave being done by other gaming companies,” Vainio says and adds, “Our strengths are in mobile gaming development, so we are concentrating on that at the moment.” As for Epic Owl’s future, Vainio once again refers back to one key word: agile. “We adjust our direction very often so while we are in mobile gaming now, it doesn’t mean that we’ll still be there in five years’ time.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-leads-the-way-for-business-angel-networks/,Finland leads the way for business angel networks,"FiBAN (Finnish Business Angels Network) has been making waves in European angel investing for some time now and has given rise to the creation of NordicBAN (Nordic Business Angels Network). Established in 2010,   is Europe’s largest angel network and has been twice recognised as its best by the European Business Angels Network. The company provides education, training and networking to angel investors interested in startups. It is also the national lobbying authority for angel investing in Finland. The idea behind   was devised in order to develop a one-market region in the Nordic and Baltic countries to allow for cross border investment.  , network manager for FiBAN, describes NordicBAN as being “a network of networks”. NordicBAN connects angel networks from around the Nordic region and allows them to network with each other. This opens doors for both investors and startups, and allows more variety among where investments are made and who is making them. A strong startup culture plays an important role in turning around the fortunes of the current economic climate. Receiving funding to grow is essential. “We don’t have a choice, we really have to have new innovations to be able to establish new jobs,” Nilsen points out. Matchmaking events that connect its investors with startup companies are organised by FiBAN. Nilsen explains that this is because it takes a certain investor and a certain startup to work together: “The connection between angel investors and startups is very personal”. Claes Mikko Nilsen (left), Helleke Heikkinen and Jan D. Oker-Blom of FiBAN. Angel investing might seem risky to some, as around 50 per cent of startups fail, but FiBAN recommends to its network that they should have several small investments. Because of this angel investors must work together and share the benefits of their investments. “It’s a channel of investment that is better than what most countries have because it’s national,” says  , managing director of FiBAN, adding, “you get a better deal flow that is relevant as you get to look at many companies.” It’s not easy for a startup to receive capital in its early stages and angel funding is not an exception to this. Just 34 per cent of pitching startups receive an investment from FiBAN networkers. But Oker Blom explains that Finland is a good place to do business: “It’s a relatively safe place to invest in. We are happy to have foreign investors investing in Finland.” When it comes to angel investing, variety is not only the spice of life, it is essential to achieving success. “We are eager to have foreign investors; in a way you could say they have a small advantage,” Oker Blom explains. “If you get an option to have a foreign investor on board with your startup, you are perhaps more interested in taking him/her as it is a different point of view and it’s also opening some doors for internationalisation”. It takes time to get to know investors and investors to get to know the team behind the startup, Nilsen explains. A process of setting goals and being able to achieve them is more important to investors than the product being provided. He recommends to startups that they should have an excellent team that can deliver, as this is what angel investors will be looking for. Investors will evaluate the startups for a period of time before an investment is made and it is essential that the companies deliver on any promises that are made in that time. “Startups must build trust with investors before an investment is made,” Nilsen explains."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-paves-the-way-for-robotic-vehicles/,Finland paves the way for robotic vehicles,"The perfect test environment for Amazon’s delivery drones and Google’s self-driving cars may soon be found in Finland. Especially when challenging Arctic conditions enter the picture. Unmanned aircrafts, driverless cars and roads that sense their environment are the future of transport, but for now they are concepts in need of extensive testing. This is where Finland steps in by offering a strong digital infrastructure, plenty of ICT and robotics expertise, challenging winter conditions and permissive legislation for transport testing. These elements form the backbone of Finland’s new strategic plan to become a pioneering development and test environment for intelligent transport automation. The plan covers all transportation modes – road, rail, water and air – as long as a robotic system or a device increasingly capable of independent action, learning and decision-making is involved. “Automation will bring many benefits. Traffic will become more fluent and safety will drastically improve. 90 per cent of traffic accidents today are caused by a human error,” says  , robotics specialist at the  , which is behind the strategy. “But for automation to advance as rapidly and safely as possible, it needs to be tested in different kinds of conditions.” Consequently Finland has set its focus on building suitable digital traffic infrastructure, deep public-private collaboration and the right legislative environment for real-world pilots and experiments. Finland is already among the forerunners in allowing testing on public roads and is currently reviewing other legislative areas. For example, while every car on Finnish roads needs to have a driver, the driver doesn’t have to be inside the car which allows for remotely controlled testing. The Finnish Transport Safety Agency Trafi has even created ‘a one stop shop’ concept for all testing related services. “As far as we know there isn’t any other country in the world where practically the whole road network is open for experimentation,” Miettinen says. “Furthermore Trafi announced in September the world’s most permissive regulation for [the testing of] remotely piloted aircraft systems.” Finland’s plans are still in their early stages, but they are already taking advantage of the country’s Northern location: a unique Arctic test ecosystem for intelligent transport systems and automated driving is currently being built in Lapland. 90 per cent of traffic accidents are caused by a human error. Automation is believed to turn the traffic more fluent and improve road safety. “There is a global need for this. At the moment no test ecosystems exist anywhere in the world where automated driving could be tested in challenging conditions,” says  , managing director at Fell Lapland Business Services, and coordinator of the project. “Currently testing is mostly done in summer conditions, but to commercialise and advance these solutions automated driving has to also work in winter conditions.” The project, called ‘ ’, includes both closed and public test roads and is open for any company looking to participate. The only requirement is they contribute to the development of connected vehicles, automated route management, digital transport infrastructure or innovative mobility services. In practice these categories can include anything from a real-time warning system of reindeers on a road to robotic cars communicating with one another. The first tests are scheduled to start late this year after a suitable stretch of public road is equipped with all the necessary sensors and monitoring tools. Current participants in Aurora include traffic authorities, Finnish Meteorological Institute, National Land Survey of Finland as well as mapping company Here, private test area Lapland Proving Ground and traffic infrastructure condition monitoring specialist Roadscanners. The project has also raised plenty of international interest. “We want to create new kinds of business opportunities both for Finnish and international companies,” says Viinanen. “The goal is to make [Fell Lapland] the Silicon Valley of intelligent transportation – and that is entirely possible.” Aurora is currently the flagship project in Finland, but the long term goal is to create a test ecosystem with several globally significant intelligent transport automation hubs set up in the country by 2020. In fact, Finland is already involved in several pan-Nordic and European projects developing intelligent transport systems. These include Nordic Way where current mobile networks are used to advance communication between vehicles and between a vehicle and traffic infrastructure. Miettinen envisions a future where automation has seamlessly intertwined with everyday transport by air, land and water. With its legislation, innovation and Arctic testing climate Finland hopes to become a major part of this. As the slogan for the Finnish plan goes: “If it works in Finland, it works anywhere.” The world’s first Arctic test ecosystem for intelligent transport systems and automated driving is being built in Finnish Lapland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/binderholz-spruces-up-production-with-finnish-expansion/,Binderholz spruces up production with Finnish expansion,"A major Finnish acquisition boosts the global plans of wood processing specialist Binderholz. During its 60 years of operation   has grown into one of Europe’s largest manufacturers of solid wood products. Now the Austrian family company has further expanded its production capabilities with a new Nordic facility. In January, Binderholz finalised the acquisition of Finnish sawmill operator Vapo Timber which has two sites in Eastern Finland. “[This acquisition] is of great importance for Binderholz,” says company owner  . “It opens up new dimensions in terms of the quality of our machined products [and] enables us to enter new markets and reach new milestones.” The Finnish sawmills, located in Lieksa and Nurmes, will operate under the name ‘Binderholz Nordic’ and act as the group’s Nordic headquarters. They will serve Binderholz customers worldwide, with a particular focus on the joinery and construction industries in Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia and the UK. The Finnish facilities will also provide timber to Binderholz’s sites in Central Europe where it will be processed into solid edge-glued wood products. As part of the acquisition Binderholz took over all 147 employees at the Finnish sawmills and plans to quickly grow operations by recruiting 40 to 80 additional staff in the next few years. Currently Binderholz employs 1350 people across its five Austrian, two German and two new Finnish sites. Binderholz Group has built a strong reputation as a developer of versatile products and high-technology production methods. The company manufactures a variety of wood products, from lumber and profiled timber to single-layer and multi-layer solid wood panels and glued laminated timber. Binderholz plans to grow its Finnish operations by recruiting new employees and investing to increase production and processing capabilities. Pictured (left to right) Ludwig Foidl, Hans Binder, Matteo Binder, Suvi Kupiainen (CFO Vapo), Anne Liukkonen (Business Controller Vapo), Juhani Ylä-Sahra (Managing Director Vapo Timber), Tomi Yli-Kyyny (CEO Vapo) These products rely heavily on their raw materials and the high quality and availability of spruce and pine particularly attracted Binderholz to Finland. Binder also highlights Finland’s legal stability and the significant status of the forest industry in the country as important to the investment decision. In addition Finland has a long tradition of sustainable and future-oriented forest management which aligns with Binderholz’s key values. The company operates with a no-waste principle and all of its waste timber (a production by-product) is processed into biofuels and green electricity. This same approach will be applied in Finland. Binderholz has already started technical improvements at the two sawmills which will include the expansion of their combined cutting capacity from 1.75 million to 2.55 million cubic meters per year. The turnover of the Binderholz Group will increase by approximately 100 million euros as a result of the acquisition and will now total up to 500 million euros in 2016. Binderholz spent a long time identifying the right opportunity to enter the Nordics prior to the Vapo Timber acquisition and an important part of the process has been its collaboration with government agency Invest in Finland (IIF). “It helps a lot to have a partner on your side who knows the market and has access to authorities and necessary key stakeholders,” Binder stresses. But the acquisition is only the first step for Binderholz in Finland. The company plans further investments in production and processing capabilities and has a long term goal of building a high-level competence centre of solid wood production in the country. “We see the extraordinarily high quality of the sawn timber produced in these two sawmills as an excellent starting material for all further value-added stages, which we plan to establish over the next few years,” Binder summarises. Binderholz is also looking to use its Finnish operations to target new opportunities in Asia, North Africa and the Middle East. The Lieksa and Nurmes sawmills have a lot to sink their teeth into. The Finnish sawmills, located in Lieksa and Nurmes, will operate under the name ‘Binderholz Nordic’ and act as the group’s Nordic headquarters. Pictured Lieksa’s sawmill."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-makes-iot-connection/,Finland makes the IoT connection,"The Internet of Things is driving a number of Finnish companies and startups to create exceptional experiences in the field of connectivity. When British entrepreneur   first coined the term Internet of Things (IoT) back in 1999, it was difficult to fathom that one day all products would be online and connected. Now, according to the most recent predictions, this reality is only a matter of years away. Here are three Finnish companies leading the change to create fresh IoT possibilities. Based in the city of Vaasa, software company  has been supplying IoT-based systems for close to 16 years. “Our service includes all expertise needed in designing electronics, embedded software, tool level software, mobile software and business level software,” explains managing director  . “We have over 300 experts working for us.” Wapice offers mass tailored IoT services without any kind of programming. Taking the first three letters of its company name from the mobile Internet, Wapice’s IoT products are known as IoT Ticket and Summium. The recently released sixth version of IoT Ticket consists of hardware, a cloud service that includes a Big Data database, reporting and user interfaces. “It is one of the most intuitive and fastest ways to build an IoT-environment,” Tuominen explains. “Now we have also been connecting a mass tailored CPQ-environment – our Summium product – to the IoT platform, so we are able to offer mass tailored services without any kind of programming.” Wapice’s customers can be found across the energy sector, operating with moving machines and also within the manufacturing industry. “We are growing fast,” Tuominen observes. “We recruited 60 new experts last year and we are going to recruit 100 more in 2016. “IoT will change the world.” Did you know that the hourly cost of cargo damage worldwide is 5.7 million euros? Jyväskylä’s  tackles this problem by collecting essential data from sea containers. “We are a cleantech company with the technology and vision to make logistics greatly more efficient,” explains business development officer  . “We are able to reduce cargo losses and optimise shipping like never before.” Conexbird tackles daily cargo damage problems by collecting essential data from sea containers. Conexbird’s offering is spread across three patented services. First up, Conexbird Wave manages the controlling of cargo, monitoring its exact condition during the entire handling process, especially at the crucial loading stage. As the container remains unopened for the duration of its journey, ensuring everything is in its correct place from the get-go, it has a positive effect on companies’ profits in the long run. Secondly, Conexbird Wind handles container flow optimisation. The service can be integrated into any container-handling device such as cranes and stackers to remove process bottlenecks. Finally, Conexbird Analytics boosts efficiency, algorithms and new lines of products by providing access to relevant data. “Every day more and more shipping containers are being filled with smartphones, t-shirts and products to satisfy demanding consumers,” Polvinen states. “Everything is depending on global logistics. Conexbird has the opportunity to change logistics forever and make it more efficient to allow for better profits, while making it much more sustainable for the whole globe.” is a global IoT operator enabling the transformation from physical products to intelligent services in any industry. It is also positioning itself to become the primary platform for spimes in the Industrial Internet and IoT. “IoT and Big Data alone are not worth much, but when you combine that with spime, you actually have an evolving algorhythmic system on top of Big Data and the network,” explains president and CEO  . BaseN transforms physical products to intelligent services in any industry. Continuously developing over the past 14 years as a Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, Basen offers an extremely scalable, fully distributed, resilient and secure real-time monitoring and control platform for ICT, M2M, and IoT combined. Recently, BaseN has boosted its cloud storage capabilities to meet projected growth by buying raw telecom and computing capacity in a form of physical servers. “We are currently looking for customers that have a scalability challenge,” Hurri continues. “Sometimes they have to build internal database solutions and launch ERP products or projects, and have realised in order to go to production scale, the architecture and design have not been scalable.” Customers already onboard with the company represent the energy, manufacturing and other heavy, mission-critical industries. “We aim to find large industrial customers that have the capability of launching totally disruptive products,” Hurri says, “but also the startups that need to ensure they can scale up if the business kicks and they have an ‘iPhone moment’.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/startup-refugees-turns-reception-centres-into-startup-hubs/,Startup Refugees turns reception centres into startup hubs,"Cooperation project Startup Refugees, set up by Finnish journalists and entrepreneurs Riku Rantala and Tunna Milonoff, gives refugees the skills to enter the workforce and set up businesses. Rantala and Milonoff got the idea for the project while doing their series  , a popular combination of political documentary films and talk show. The adventurous pair felt they needed to stimulate people’s thinking rather than just allowing them to stare meaninglessly at a screen. Riku Rantala (left) and Tunna Milonoff founded the Startup Refugees programme to create positive impact. Rantala describes his motivation behind the Startup Refugees as wanting to make a positive impact: “In our case we believe in karma,” he says. The reception centres in Finland provide the basic needs for refugees – food, shelter and water – but   as an organisation aims to provide a sense of hope for people who have left behind war torn countries. Rantala feels that not enough is being done to help refugees integrate into Finnish society. “We need to help refugees to settle,” he states. “If nobody is helping them to make business then it’s going to be a lot harder to do that.” Startup Refugees believes that the work should start in the reception centres. As days in the centres can be long and boring, the programme aims to make this time more constructive by giving the people the means to start their own micro businesses in the centre, or working towards getting their hygiene passport to work in the centre’s kitchen. Essentially the programme is designed to give refugees the essential tools to allow them to work towards bigger goals. “They want to do something meaningful and at the same time make their days in the centre more comfortable,” Rantala observes. Startup Refugees receive the necessary resources by getting sponsorship from companies and people who want to help. Already 350 different companies, organisations and individuals have signed up, including Finnish gaming giant  ,  , the  , and the  , as well as several communications and PR agencies, universities and research institutes. The companies and people all help in different ways: the large companies donate money, the small businesses training and equipment, and experienced business coaches their time. Startup Refugees brings together public sector, refugees, companies and investors. Companies might have many reasons to get involved: perhaps they might be looking for someone who speaks a particular language and may be able to make that initial contact from the centre. The organisation is able to deliver hope by providing mentoring from businesses and entrepreneurs. This aims to improve refugees’ chances of employment and also to initiate a thinking process that may allow the refugees to form their own companies. When it comes to applying funding for refugee startups the organisation acts as a networking group. Startup Refugees is able to connect people in the centre with investors as well as mentors to train the aspiring refugee entrepreneurs and give them the foundation to succeed. Rantala explains that although the focus is on startups, employment is the main target. “We’re not making any limits for people; if somebody gets a job then it’s always good.” Due the unique nature of the Startup Refugees program, Rantala believes that someday it will spread outside of the country although the focus remains in Finland for the time being. “Right now [the goal] is to make this work really well here but it would be really interesting to copy the concept,” Rantala says. New startups that are born in reception centres would create diversity among the business landscape in Finland and promote exports to the Middle East via their founders’ established contacts in the region. “If there is nobody in Finland who knows how to handle the culture or how to meet the people’s needs, how will we ever do good business there?” Rantala ponders. The project also sets out to change the public perception of refugees in the media. “Sometimes they receive abuse and are spoken about like animals; people tend to forget that they’re a really diverse group of people.” Startup Refugees helps people to create business, for example in reception centers. Pictured a reception centre laundry, established by the refugees themselves."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/feedbackly-changes-the-game-for-customer-feedback/,Feedbackly changes the game for customer feedback,"The best products and services fill a real need. In the case of Finnish tech startup Feedbackly this has meant creating an all-in-one software tool for measuring and analysing customer feedback. Knowing what your customers think can be worth its weight in gold. Which is why today customer feedback is collected through numerous channels, from physical stores and online shops to emails and mobile apps. But as the avenues grow, so does the challenge of managing the vast amounts of data they produce. This is the issue Helsinki-based  has set out to solve. “In the traditional model, customer feedback from different channels is gathered by a separate app, service or device specific to that channel,” says  , CEO and co-founder of the company. “We make it possible to gather all that feedback into one place.” Feedbackly’s all-in-one platform can be used to collect, manage and analyse customer feedback across different channels, whether it is a website survey or an in-store device on the other side of the globe. It can also integrate with a client’s existing devices and services and all data is available in real-time through a unified dashboard. According to Männistö, the whole package runs in the cloud and can be deployed anywhere without deep technical experience. “This is a comprehensive feedback tool, you cannot find it on the same scale anywhere else,” Männistö explains. “You might be able to buy something like this for a lot of money, but there is no other scalable, cloud-based solution which is also targeted at smaller companies.” The platform was launched for international markets in early May. Expectation are high as the market entry is boosted by 500 000 euros of fresh funding Feedbackly raised from a group of Finnish investors in April. Behind Feedbackly is the ambition of three students. Today the startup employs seven people, but the story starts from late 2012 when Männistö,  and   began building an easy-to-use feedback device for retail while finishing their university studies. Feedbackly’s international ambitions have been boosted by a 500 000-euro funding round the startup closed in April. The tablet-based device attracted some big customers in Finland, but the trio soon realised one feedback channel was not enough to help companies improve customer experience and boost sales. Now the device is part of Feedbackly’s multi-channel platform. “The feedback device is still an important part of our offering, but it is not the main thing anymore,” Männistö explains. “We have also changed our name [formerly Tapin Feedback] and completely revamped our brand to cater for the new focus and international growth.” Feedbackly believes its all-in-one approach appeals particularly to retail companies and the service industry from banks to health care, where customer experience plays a crucial role. The new service also enables Feedbackly to tap into a completely new sector: employee wellbeing. The cloud platform offers large corporations an easy survey tool to gauge employee satisfaction and get real-time feedback. “The happier employees are, the better they do their work and create better customers experiences,” says Männistö. “This is why it is important to advance employee satisfaction and wellbeing and collect feedback from this side of the business.” With the revamp behind it, Feedbackly’s focus is now on international markets. The company is building a reseller and partner network starting in Sweden and expanding to Germany, France and the UK later this year. “Our international go-to-market model is to do our own sales and work with resellers directly,” Männistö says. “Where we expand depends on where we can find good resellers. There is no point to try build up sales entirely on our own.” Feedbackly has timed its launch well. Consumers are growing increasingly powerful thanks to online reviews and social media, while global e-commerce players turn up the heat on the retail industry. The tougher the competition gets, the more companies have to invest in new ways to better serve their customers – and they will find Feedbackly waiting. “The companies which offer the best customer experience will always win [in the market],” Männistö summarises. “We want to help companies to achieve that position.” Feedbackly says its cloud platform is the first customer feedback tool to enable companies to use a single dashboard to manage and collect data from all feedback channels."

A unique piano scaler tool is also in the works: giving an abundance of info just by rolling it over the keys, the concept was recently patented in the US. “There are backing tracks built into the app, then we have scales that fit those backing tracks,” Pölönen states. “Browse your favourite genre, then choose the scales. It tells you the notes. You can start playing them and it will sound good right from the start.” In keeping with the theme of young talent, Pölönen himself is also a prodigy of sorts. First coming up with the idea of MusiClock as a 15-year-old frustrated music student, he won a national innovation contest with the concept, before coming up trumps at an EU competition for young scientists in Prague in 2013. On the back of such momentum, Pölönen then teamed up with his brother,  , to establish MusiClock in 2014. The fruit of their labour took the stage last year and became the App Store’s number one paid music app in nine countries. The next step sees the duo making music even more tangible for youngsters, with an   of the concept. “Basically there is a plate and a wheel that you can rotate,” Pölönen states. “It’s for music theory classes. Teachers have said that shapes and colours, stuff like this, make the learning process more effective for children getting started.” The analogue embodiment of the app also digs a little deeper than its digital cousin. “With the wooden version we have even more theory behind it,” Pölönen states. “You can solve scales, chords, intervals, modes, keys, accidentals. It’s more like an educational tool.” Rest assured that the houselights aren’t going on for MusiClock’s innovations after this. Not by a long shot – the brothers have a series of encores in store. First up, those who favour a twinkle on the ivories rejoice that a unique piano scaler tool is also in the works. Giving an abundance of info just by rolling it over the keys, the concept was recently patented in the US. This is a timely development for MusiClock. With a forthcoming funding round beckoning, the company is set to go global this year. “The best thing to see in the future is that schools, music universities and conservatories use this method to actually educate their students,” Pölönen states. “That is one of our main goals.” The international language of music also means that the market potential has no borders. “Whenever somebody wants to jam with their friends in Africa, Asia or Australia – wherever – you can actually use these tools,” Pölönen observes. “Music is universal.” “With the wooden version [of MusiClock] we have even more theory behind it. You can solve scales, chords, intervals, modes, keys, accidentals. It’s more like an educational tool,” Pölönen says."

During their 15 years of combined corporate experience in Finland,  and   had become acutely aware that enterprise and learning management software lacked the ease of use and simplicity enjoyed by most consumer-facing technologies. Earlier this decade they set out to remedy this, pooling together their knowledge of building open source-based phones and apps. First they launched a service to help elderly people embrace modern technology. However, this proved too much of an ask and the idea struggled to gain traction. Having returned to the drawing board, the duo sought out a sector that could be well served by their expertise. Their gaze fell upon educational platforms. Now, here was a lot of potential indeed. Established in 2013,  allows educators and students around the world to create, share and manage online courses online for free. “Access to education really should be our basic right, but it is true only for portion of humanity,” Gerasimenko explains. “We want to be a one-size-fits-all platform that doesn’t force you how to teach your course. Instead it just gives you enough flexibility and essential tools for teaching.” The rest is history for this Helsinki-based company. In 2014 Ed Tech named Eliademy among Europe’s 20 fastest growing and most innovative e-learning companies. Not to be outdone, a prestigious Edison Gold Award arrived the following year. Finland-based Eliademy allows educators and students around the world to create, share and manage online courses online for free. Eliademy’s user base now represents 160 countries, who together can choose between around 25 000 different courses in numerous languages. Topics range from how to build mobile apps, to pitching tips and an introduction to marketing, along with clinical pharmacology and the works of  . Yet, where Eliademy’s story differs from many upstarts is that it has yet to fully capitalise on its popularity. In fact, around 95 per cent of the online platform’s courses are still without charge – both for users and instructors. “It would also be easy to slap on Google advertising and be swimming in money,” Gerasimenko states. “But we don’t want students to be influenced in any way; we want it to be a simple, safe environment where they come and learn.” Eliademy has been able to stay afloat by offering a premium service, which caters to organisations that wish to charge for their courses, as well as others seeking to disseminate information away from the public eye. “We have over 2 000 different organisations that use our platform,” Gerasimenko says, listing various higher learning institutes, governmental organisations and prominent NGOs. “On top of that we have a lot of small companies under 100 people who are into delivering confidential material to their client or customers.” This approach to sharing knowledge also extends offline for Gerasimenko. Drawing on his experiences with Eliademy, he is currently a board member of non-profit PMI Chapter Finland, providing local project workers with ongoing learning, networking and community support. Recently he also started Nordic Founders, a focal point for anyone interested in practical tips for running a startup or small business in Finland. Over 400 members have already attended its monthly meetup at the Aalto Entrepreneurship Society. Unsurprisingly, both of these are offered for free. “Living in Finland makes you think that education should not be sold, to anyone,” he states. “We want Eliademy to be a simple, affordable platform. It’s made in Finland, run from Finland; everything is done in Finland. “Go and give it a try.” Eliademy celebrated its first anniversary in February 2014.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-virtual-frontline/,Finland at the virtual frontline,"With virtual reality the next frontier for digital innovation, a growing number of Finnish companies are offering a pioneering look at things to come. Science fiction has always offered far-fetched future imaginings of various shapes and sizes. Sometimes, however, this crystal ball gazing also comes true. A self-driving car? Google now has the answer. Video conferencing? Thanks Skype. How about virtual reality, then? Well, the virtual and augmented reality industry is tipped to reach 120 billion US dollars in the next four years. Given Finland’s status as a global player in IT, it’s no surprise then that it’s also home to a hive of VR development. Alongside individual companies increasingly attracting funding, the local VR community Fivr also received a 250 000-euro capital boost in April from the Technology Industries of Finland Centennial Foundation. In light of VR’s healthy forecast in Finland, here are three local companies at the forefront. “VR headsets have a chance to change the world by providing a completely new platform for games and other content in a totally unprecedented way,” says Ville Kivistö, CEO and co-founder of Mindfield Games. Focusing on VR games, independent Finnish developer   recently released its first title, sci-fi explorer  . “We are one of those smaller indie studios who are very proud of what we do,” explains  , CEO and co-founder. “Not many developers can brag about having more than 2.5 years of experience in VR development.” During this time, the 15-person company has seen VR’s user base gradually widen from hardcore gamers to a more casual audience. “VR headsets have a chance to change the world by providing a completely new platform for games and other content in a totally unprecedented way,” Kivistö explains. “The immersive experience is so different from any other media that our biggest problem has been how to explain the feeling to someone who has never tried virtual reality before.” Nonetheless, there are many in close proximity to give them a hand. Similar to its games industry, the Finnish VR community is extremely open and supportive. “We have lots of talented and focused people who know how to create great content and will make sure the end product is polished and plays good,” Kivistö states. “We share knowledge among ourselves. The future seems very bright.” Helsinki-based company   enables users to easily create their own VR experiences with a web browser. “We see VR and 360 as just another media format; just like pictures and video,” explains CEO  . “What we are doing is just going to live in social media, in Twitter and Facebook. It’s a link; you click on it and get the VR experience.” Vizor enables users to easily create their own VR experiences with a web browser. Vizor is compatible with different VR headsets, including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Google Cardboard. Interestingly, it also works without a VR headset. Having landed 350 000 euros in seed funding in September last year, Vizor is busily attracting various user groups, such as people using 360 cameras. “We are also seeing lots of educators coming to Vizor,” Jäderholm states. “Schools all around the world are using it to introduce virtual reality to students. A lot of schools see Vizor as an easy starting point because it’s all on the web. Their teachers don’t have to install anything on their workstations.” Nonetheless, Vizor’s biggest user group is made up of professionals from marketing agencies and media houses. “We are working on making our service a lot easier to use,” Jäderholm says. “Vizor is going to be in beta testing for the foreseeable future. It’s already completely usable; anybody can come and check it out. The editor is all open source and it’s free to use.” Having made a name for itself developing interactive image and video annotation software,   raised 1.2 million euros in funding back in February from private investors. This capital boost has helped spawn its new VR editor. “Our new VR editor lets users also add background audio to 360 images, such as the sound of the wind, birds singing, a narrating voice or their own music,” says Thinglink’s CEO Ulla Engeström. “People use Thinglink to annotate images and videos,” explains CEO  . “Supporting 360 images and videos seemed like a natural extension to our existing product.” The company has flung open the virtual doors to various sectors that are harnessing this new media format as a publishing platform, headed by education. “In our new app  , we take students to visit different kinds of ecosystems, and they can learn by looking around, spotting details and unlocking additional information about plants and animals in a narrated virtual reality tour,” Engeström explains. “Our new VR editor lets users also add background audio to 360 images, such as the sound of the wind, birds singing, a narrating voice or their own music.” Elsewhere, alongside advertising, Engeström lists interactive real estate tours, magazines, music videos or documentaries, shoppable spaces and art galleries as other potential segments of use. “Many of our larger publisher users believe mobile VR is the new Internet,” she enthuses. “In four years, six billion people will have a smartphone in their hands, and every smartphone user is a potential VR consumer. Thinglink will continue to build innovative solutions for making all our visual environments ‘clickable’, engaging and more meaningful.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/easyanticheat-squares-off-game-cheats/,EasyAntiCheat squares off against game cheats,"Wondering what a bear, a sauna and an impromptu camping trip to Stockholm have in common? The answer is ‘Easy’. Childhood friends can be many things: a reminder of humble roots, a thorn in the side or, in the case of  and  , a springboard for success. Entrepreneurial at heart, Kiviniemi founded his first company when he was 16 years old, renting game servers for   matches. All was running smoothly for the budding businessman, until he bumped into his pal’s mischievous intent. “Aarni was a black hat cheater back in the day,” he recalls, with a smile. “He threatened to destroy my servers. But then I said, what if he would use his skills to make an anti-cheat – it is more challenging.” Thankfully, Rautava was up to the task. With his skills harnessed for the common good, such was his enthusiasm for his new role that he eventually went on to found his own company, focusing on a third party e-sports anti-cheat. So, that should be the end of the story, right? Well, not quite. Now, it’s often said that Finnish women are some of the country’s most prolific importers, with many a lovestruck foreigner upping stumps and moving to this chilly corner of the world after meeting the girl of their dreams. EasyAntiCheat’s bear mascot, Teddy. You can add Belgian   to this long list. But where he joins this particular tale is that his lady in question just happens to be Rautava’s cousin. And, given that this is Finland, it didn’t take long before he, Rautava and Kiviniemi were seated together in a sauna, pondering life’s conundrums. “All three of us started talking about anti-cheat,” Allaeys says. “Aarni was complaining how his market was going down. We thought, let’s just team up and make a company. We would shift the focus to an integrated cutting-edge anti-cheat, for games like   and .” Two months later the trio found themselves inside another sauna – Aalto University’s Startup Sauna accelerator, to be precise – and the rest, as they say, is history. Except that it wasn’t. Not yet. After a frustrating couple of weeks of unanswered emails and dead ends, the trio grew increasingly desperate. The solution came from their mentor at Startup Sauna: go and pitch a tent in front of the company they most want to speak to until they secure some face time. With nothing to lose, a couple of days later they boarded a plane, unaware of just how dramatically their fortunes were about to change. “Monday morning we went to one of the top game development companies in Stockholm,” Allaeys enthuses. “It turned out to be great timing. At 9 am we were in a meeting and presenting what we do. We got introductions to other studios, signed three games and built the company from there.” Nowadays,  ’s all-around service counters hacking and cheating in PC online games. Under the watchful gaze of its bear mascot, Teddy (“Don’t bear with the cheaters”), the preventative measures of the company encapsulate the game process in a safe environment. “We protect games against the likes of code injections, external access and reverse engineering,” Kiviniemi says. “The idea is that the game publisher can fully focus on developing their game without worrying about hackers ruining the game experience for others.” EasyAntiCheat offers same day integration worldwide and the solution remains independent of the game development cycle. Many have flocked to the service, with the company’s revenue growth rate tripling annually. In fact, things have been moving so quickly for the bootstrapped trio over the past couple of years that they have had to change offices frequently, to make room for their growing ranks of employees. Even now, although their current working space enjoys a gob-smacking panorama over Helsinki, and neighbours such as F-Secure, it seems they probably shouldn’t be throwing away their packing boxes any time soon. “I only found this office in November,” Kiviniemi laments with a shrug. “I thought it was going to be too big, too expensive. But now it’s getting to be too small.” EasyAntiCheat’s all-around service counters hacking and cheating in PC online games."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/artist-exchange-wants-transform-live-music-markets/,Artist Exchange wants to transform live music markets,"The Finnish startup Artist Exchange describes itself as the ‘Airbnb for live music’. Its digital platform brings ease and efficiency to buying and selling live gigs.  Booking an artist to perform at an event may sound like a straightforward task, but the reality can be very different. It includes tracking down different music agencies, managing several quotes manually and in some cases waiting days for replies. “It is a very fragmented market,” says  , founder of Artist Exchange and a former event organiser. “In Finland alone there are 30 major music agencies that represent different artists. If you want to book a gig, you first have to find out which agency to contact. But if all artists are in one service, you can go there directly and get quotes for multiple artists no matter which agencies represent them.” This is exactly what  has set out to do. Born out of Keränen’s frustration with the inefficiency of buying live music, the startup has developed an online platform of the same name  to handle every step of the process digitally. “We have built process management tools for the sellers of live gigs and a marketplace for the buyers, where they can easily find and book interesting artists,” Keränen explains. In practice both professional and occasional buyers can use the platform to search for bands, request quotes from several artists simultaneously and manage and document the entire negotiation process in one place. Furthermore in the future music agencies can automatically notify their artists of new confirmed gigs and inform them of related arrangements through the platform. Artist Exchange’s platform was launched in Finland in March and has already proven demand. Over 500 Finnish bands are on its roster and it lists some of the country’s biggest music agencies and professional buyers among its customers. “Many have tried to make different kinds of marketplaces for bands, but they have acted as digital music agencies,” explains Hannu Keränen. This is a promising start for a company which was only founded in early 2015 by Keränen,   and  Now Artist Exchange employs nine people in Helsinki and continuously works to build new features for the platform. A key upcoming addition will be the ability to check which artists are available on a certain date, such as next New Year, and compare prices or ask for quotes. Keränen stresses this kind of calendar information about major artists has not been available on any other service before. The startup is also planning to introduce elements familiar to peer-to-peer services, such as rating sellers and publishing their average response time. “These kinds of models work well in many services,” Keränen says. “I believe they will improve the buyers’ experience and the efficiency of the whole market.” These ideas have not come from Artist Exchange alone. The platform has been built in close collaboration with its users, from music agencies to event organisers, as Keränen believes this is the only way to succeed in a new market: “The people we work with have been in the industry for decades,” Keränen says. “How could we build a service to improve their efficiency without working very closely with them? We have received lots of support. There has even been a slightly patriotic approach, that together we can build something amazing which can change the music industry globally. “ Advice is not the only support Artist Exchange has received. To date the startup has raised a total of 400 000 euros in funding from Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation) and private investors, including  , the lead singer of internationally successful Finnish music band  . Now Artist Exchange is preparing to close its second funding round within the next few months and start its international expansion in late 2016. “Live music markets are quite local, you need to go through them market by market”, Keränen says. ”Germany and Sweden are our next target countries. Germany is the biggest live music market in Europe.” Keränen believes the market for live concerts will only grow as music streaming services increasingly replace album sales. This also means more demand for efficient booking processes and easy ways to connect music buyers and sellers across country borders – exactly the role Artist Exchange aims to play. “We hope to act as a bridge to international live music sales in future,” Keränen summarises. “Our big vision is that one day  world tour will be booked through Artist Exchange.” Artist Exchange already has over 500 bands on its roster and caters not only to professionals, but to people who have no previous experience in booking live performance."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/leading-and-feeding-employment-2/,Leading and feeding employment,"With many people coming from abroad to work in Finland, companies have to adapt to suit this new international workforce. One of these companies is Leadfeeder, whose employees come from Finland and other parts of Europe. , a company that has created a sales lead generation tool for B2B businesses that shows which companies visit your website and what they do there, has 80 per cent of its customers outside Finland.  At the moment the company has an international team of nine in Helsinki but it is looking to triple its workforce in the next year. In terms of the job market in Finland, neither Leadfeeder’s co-founder and Software Engineer   nor Communications and Customer Support Expert   had encountered any problems in finding employment outside of their home countries. Things are looking up for Leadfeeder: the company has just secured 530 000 euro seed funding from Finnish VC Superhero Capital. “I just did one interview and they hired me,” says Llongo, who moved to Finland from Spain. Although not all foreigners looking for employment in Finland are as lucky as Llongo and Seenan, who both came to Finland through Erasmus exchange programme. “I know lots of foreigners here and I really feel that they’ve struggled actually,” admits Seenan. “If you apply the model that we were taught in the UK, which is sit down, write a polite application, email it and wait, jobs don’t really come to you.” The company has also recruited employees abroad when they have not found the right person for the job from Finland. Due to the international nature of the company, the office’s daily communication between the colleagues is conducted in English. “Things function perfectly well with English as an office language,” says Seenan. Seenan notes that even though Finns speak fluent English, there is a language barrier with many foreigners who don’t learn Finnish language – very few opportunities are available for them. Moving workforce, working nomads, remote work and flexible working hours have changed the traditional working culture and the companies are adapting. Leadfeeder sees remote work as a business opportunity. “It broadens your horizons with the opportunity of finding people,” states Llongo. “The quality of applicants is much better.” However, remote work requires new working methods: “We have to change how we work. We have some processes that wouldn’t suit remote working,” says Llongo. The Finnish close-knit startup ecosystem has helped Leadfeeder to grow. “Very early on we were accepted into  , which trains the best of Northern European startups,” says Seenan. “The startup ecosystem contributed to early learning for us which was beneficial.” Things are definitely looking up for Leadfeeder; the company is backed by The Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation Tekes, and they have snatched their first major VC investment through Vendep. “We’ve just secured 530 000 euro seed funding from one of the new Finnish VC funds on the block – Superhero Capital – and the whole thing has kind of been tied together by our participation in the Finnish startup accelerator, Startup Sauna,” Seenan says. When it comes to setting up your own business, Seenan has three words: “Just do it.” Peter Seenan talking about Startup Sauna accelerator programme that has helped Leadfeeder to grow."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sxsw-recap-a-finn-in-a-whirl-of-tech-and-rubber-ducks/,SXSW recap: A Finn in a whirl of tech and rubber ducks,"What’s the hype around South by Southwest (SXSW)? Juha Rippi from the Finnish company Vincit took part in the festival and unveils the highlights of the 2016 SXSW: the biggest trends in tech, how to cut the queues for RSVP parties and how the Nordic Lighthouse concept shed light on the Nordic startup scene. For a first timer Texas-based   can be overwhelming. The event is more like a festival than a traditional expo and consists of three parts: Interactive, Music and Film. The pure amount of events and exhibitors is incredible and a ton of time goes into research on what sessions to attend to. Interactive consisted of tons of presentations about technology and design and a huge trade show, where exhibitors presented their products and services. This year the registered attendance at the event was a whopping 72 000, not counting the thousands of people attending just the side events without an official badge. Along with the main trade show, there were side exhibitions that each would have been a decent sized expo all by themselves in Finland. These were SXCreate, SXHealth&MedTech, Job Market, VR/AR showcase, Music Gear and Gaming Expo. This year’s biggest trends in the trade show seemed to be different kinds of wearables, drones and augmented reality and virtual reality. I attended about 10 different talks. My highlight was  ’s live coding and Q&A session. He and his team are doing cool stuff with the new Wolfram language. But overall, based on the ones I attended, the talks and presentations are not the reason why to come to SXSW, at least if you’re a programmer. How to share your music with several people? A party wig full of earphones solves your problem. The biggest trends in the trade show seemed to be different kinds of wearables, drones and augmented reality and virtual reality. It seemed like almost every other booth had a VR headset. There was even a separate exhibition after the trade show dedicated to AR and VR. I checked out quite a few demos and the most promising ones seemed to be related to gaming and a more interactive way of storytelling. Maybe for gaming, this could mean a return of the arcades? Our booth was located within the Scandinavian section, which had a large group of Nordic companies. I was happy to notice, that  . We had over 200 rubber ducks to give out to the participants  . I suppose our idea appealed to the attendees as we ran out of ducks already during the second day of trade show. Better bring bigger suitcases for the ducks next year! The trade show’s Asian section was a whole another story. They had come up with all kinds of crazy ideas and it was great fun taking a walk through their booths. My favourite was a party wig full of earphones. The idea is that you can share your music in a party to all your friends and maybe even sneakily attract the opposite sex closer to you. If Nordic countries were well represented in the trade show, the official Nordic SXSW venue made it even greater! Waller Creek Boathouse was turned into   and it was used for a lot of events and workshops including VC startup meetups, music presentations by Nordic bands and film presentations from Nordic filmmakers. It was a great place to make new connections and talk to people. Nordic Light House was a cooperation project between several organisations, companies and people from Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Norway. During SXSW the entire city of Austin is full of tech events, gigs and film screenings. It’s a wonderful combination of festival and tech. The city also boasts multiple RSVP parties hosted by different companies, so if you plan your schedule well beforehand, you shouldn’t have to pay for many meals or drinks during your SXSW experience. Getting in to RSVP events usually requires a pre-registration, but there’s an app for that!   signs you into all the parties and events, so you don’t have worry about registrations. Even though being slightly overwhelmed by just the magnitude of everything that was going on around us, we still managed to pull off a really successful trip. We got a bunch of new leads and contacts, learned new things from the presentations, were introduced to a lot of new companies at the trade show and most importantly solved hundreds of people’s problems by handing them a rubber duck.

It currently employs 17 people altogether and the number is growing. According to Mäkinen, no other business in Finland or abroad offers the same service as they do. However that’s not to say they don’t have anyone to compete with. Technology company Umbra, which started as a research project, was the brainchild of the CEO and company founder Otso Mäkinen. “The biggest competition comes from the customer’s team, as there is someone in house who is working on a similar problem.” Umbra’s main client base consists of US-based video game companies ranging from CD Project Red to Activision. One of the latest games to benefit from Umbra’s 3D processing and rendering optimisation is  , from game developer Eidos-Montréal “I’m a big fan of the   games,” Mäkinen admits. “Eidos-Montréal is a typical client for us – a game development studio that has a really ambitious project. We can make the content creation much easier for them.” Mäkinen sees close co-operation with the gaming companies as being beneficial for both parties: “We worked very closely with Bungie on  and they know exactly what they want. The collaboration also helped us to develop our product better.” Since virtual reality gaming has hit the market, it’s a natural venture for Umbra to undertake 3D processing and rendering games that are more immersive for the player. “Virtual reality is a big case for us,” Mäkinen says. “In virtual reality it’s even more important to have high frame rates, so that all virtual reality applications will need us in the future.” Mäkinen is confident that within five years Umbra will be at the forefront of providing 3D rendering, not only video games but for everyday life too, as 3D scanning is bringing 3D graphics into other uses. The company is also certain that demand for 3D rendering for games will not subside anytime soon. “Since we’ve already been working on it [VR] for the last 15 years, it hasn’t shown signs of dying out,” Mäkinen says. “Also, there is more and more content all the time, and we are about to optimise all of that.” Umbra is confident that within five years the company will be at the forefront of providing 3D rendering, not just for video games, but everyday life too."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-future-is-all-about-change-for-reaktor/,The future is all about change for Reaktor,"Revenue of 42 million euros last year saw this innovative company turning a tidy profit. Now it is settling in for the long haul. The neoclassical Helsinki Cathedral has dominated the cityscape of Finland’s capital since 1852. Imposing. Impressive. Iconic. Now, whilst admiring it from a window in  ’s downtown office, one could be excused for scrambling to find an appropriate adjective. Reaktor’s COO  is also momentarily at a loss for words, yet not for the same reason. He is trying to briefly summarise what his company does. “We started off as a software company and we have been expanding our horizons ever since,” he begins, after a thoughtful pause. “We began looking at the user experience, interfaces and design, followed by the business side of the solutions.” A glance at the company’s portfolio and it’s apparent why Reaktor resists easy classification. Herein lie projects across the financial, retail, media and airlines sectors, with brands including Michael Kors, HBO, Nasdaq and Finnair. “We are growing as a company by looking for new, interesting and cool stuff all the time; things that interest our customers and us,” Ruotto explains. “The common thing these companies have is that they are shifting their business in a more digital way.” Reaktor had eight people on its books when it was established in 2000. Subsequent years have seen ranks swell to 400, and the company also recognised as Europe’s best place to work. Half of its yearly growth now comes from outside Finland, specifically the US and Japan where it has established local offices. “We are growing as a company by looking for new, interesting and cool stuff all the time; things that interest our customers and us,” Reaktor’s COO Tuomas Routto says. Whether it’s revamping Finnair’s entertainment system, developing a smart space concept for Nasdaq or funnelling every Finnish radio station into your pocket, the exciting success stories keep mounting up. Alongside software development and design, and building large systems, “there are also 30 portfolio companies that we have invested in,” Ruotto outlines, “and we have a satellite project.” Ah yes, for some the sky is the limit. For others: infinite space. The Reaktor Hello World Satellite project is Finland’s first commercial satellite. Set to launch this autumn, the technology is being tapped to assist the European Space Agency with 3D printing production of a base structure on the dark side of the moon, amongst other space-related innovations. “It started as a crazy idea, like most things here,” the COO admits, with a smile. “We saw an interesting business side and then an interesting tech side. Space is a huge market and it will grow even bigger.” Meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, it’s not all about getting down to business for Reaktor. The company has also organised free coding workshops for kids since 2014. IT companies, public libraries and hundreds of enthusiastic children have all been involved – so too the President of Finland,  . “We believe coding is ‘Reading and Writing 2.0’ for small kids,” Routto says. “It is important for them to understand the world of programming and how the world works. All the children love it.” This ongoing search to push the boundaries of achievement is fuelling the company’s longevity. “I want Reaktor to still be around in 200 years,” Ruotto declares. “It is evolving all the time. We are not hanging on to any specific technology. I see us more as a launch pad for new interesting things and technologies. “We have only taken a few steps now as a company. But we are taking them in the right direction.” Half of Reaktor’s yearly growth comes from outside Finland, specifically the US and Japan where it has established local offices."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/collaboration-a-fitting-trend-for-vejits/,Collaboration a fitting trend for Vejits,"This Finnish fashion label has quickly found itself in vogue on the international stage. How could up-and-coming fashion house   have possibly known the dramatic change of fortunes awaiting it when the phone rang back in January? At the other end of the line was a representative from Oxford Fashion Studio. The fledging label received an invitation to present its wares at New York Fashion Week. “It was a total surprise that somebody knew that we exist,” recalls designer  , showing little sign of fatigue even though he returned from the Big Apple merely 24 hours earlier. “Oxford Fashion Studio was searching for new talent. They invited different brands and we were the only one from Finland.” This step up to the big-time was a considerable leap forward for the Helsinki-based team. Once there they rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest names in the industry. They staged a catwalk lined with blockers and buyers. They gave interviews, made contacts and drummed up publicity. In short: it was a raging success. Not bad at all for a company that was only founded a year ago. Vejits’ New York appearance has set the ball rolling for its forthcoming spring and summer range. Filling racks from April, the collection boasts patterns and designs that are emboldened by bright Asian colours intertwined with Nordic minimalism. Vejits was the only Finnish label invited by Oxford Fashion Studio to display its range at New York Fashion Week. Olli Turunen is pictured third from left. This unique cultural flavouring is seasoned by the origins of its core trio. Alongside Helsinki native Turunen are Russian   and   from Thailand. “We are trying to find something new – angles, cuttings, silhouettes,” Turunen states. “Our ideas come from the colour of nature and the seasons; from leaves, snow, seas and so on.” Taking its name from a Thai word meaning ‘fine art’ and ‘elegance’, Vejits’ fabric designs are created in-house, with laser printing then carried out in Thailand. Seeking to clothe people in the 25-45-age bracket, Turunen concedes that Vejits’ colourful modes of expression are not for everyone. And that’s just fine with him. “We are looking at a certain target group that likes to wear something different to the norm,” he elaborates. “With men we have put a little bit of courage into the colours and prints. The ladies’ styles are more European, more international.” Sitting in a small studio located in Helsinki’s hip suburb of Kallio, it seems fitting that while Turunen is here giving an interview, both Volodchenkov and Chuasomboon are currently attending the world’s largest fabric fair in Paris. This collaborative, outward-looking approach also extends beyond Vejits’ own members. Rather than keep its ideas and creativity buttoned up, the fashion house shares its studio space with fellow labels   by   and   by  . “We are all professionals in the textile industry with different backgrounds,” Turunen explains. “We are sharing our skills and rent, putting things together. So, this setup is possible – even with different brands. I would like to do this in an even wider way.” Achieving such a dream is well on the way to becoming a reality. One particularly promising outcome of Vejits’ New York visit was being asked to organise a Finnish-themed popup there in future, showcasing what’s going on in the local scene. “We have a lot of skilful people in Finland; together we have very strong and different collections,” Turunen enthuses. “But more courage and cooperation is needed with our designers. This is the key thing if we’d like to do it on an international level. “Let’s go and do this together!”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/walkbase-takes-stock-of-physical-retail/,Walkbase takes stock of physical retail,"Making offline sales as smart as online is merely a matter of harnessing these innovative analytics. Staff cutbacks. Stores shuttered. Stock declining. E-commerce has seemingly had a profound impact on the fortunes of brick and mortar retailers. Given this cloud of negative publicity, one could be forgiven for assuming that the statistics would tell a bleak story. Not so, according to Finnish retail analytics provider  . “Statistics still show that 80 per cent of all purchases are made in physical stores,” reveals the company’s CMO . “It’s only a certain type of shopping that you can really do online. There are many categories where you want to have the physical experience: a conversation with somebody, or touch and feel the products immediately.” Walkbase is an Internet of Things platform that provides “Google Analytics for physical retail stores”. Using signals emitted by individuals’ smartphones, customer movement is monitored easily, unobtrusively and, most importantly, securely. “We can analyse how many people come in to a store, where they go, what are the flow times at different locations and the aggregate paths they are taking,” Mattsson explains. “Then we combine these into statistical analysis.” According to Mattsson, Walkbase has proven to be most useful when optimising store layouts, customer service, merchandising and the store concept in general. By observing people’s behavioural reactions to such modifications, retailers can be agile to select and repeat those improvements that work best to create even better shopping experiences. “We can analyse how many people come in to a store, where they go, what are the flow times at different locations and the aggregate paths they are taking,” says Walkbase’s CMO Juha Mattsson. In store advertising has also become an emerging focus for the Espoo-based company. Late last year Walkbase partnered with Samsung in the UK to commence selling an augmented advertising solution to British retailers. Here Walkbase’s technology analyses customer behaviour to create shopper profiles. This data is then used to sell advertising for Samsung’s dynamic screens, as well as determine their optimal placement around the store. Doing away with the posters and banners of yore, these advertising hotspots ensure maximum exposure for the content onscreen. Elsewhere, the reach of Walkbase’s technology is not confined to the retail sector. In fact, the first time you may have heard of the company was when it announced its collaboration with Finnish airport operator Finavia in 2014. Nowadays, Helsinki Airport’s 16.4 million annual passengers can be dynamically tracked throughout the entire complex thanks to Walkbase. “We are looking at how to optimise the passenger flows, including queue management,” Mattsson explains. “Then there’s the retail side. And finally the personalised passenger information, which is a mobile application using location-based services.” Back when Walkbase was established in 2010, retail analytics was a relatively unexplored entity. Now, with the rest of the world having finally caught up, the company finds itself positioned most favourably. Thus, when asked what lies ahead for 2016, it’s somewhat unsurprising that Mattsson divulges an exciting forecast. “We are planning to make some investments into entering the North American market,” he reveals. “We are likely to publish a significant partnership later this year in regard to this.” Walkbase is also pushing the envelope once again in future, facilitating innovative engagement with customers. “This kind of digital technology enables retailers to potentially send personalised offers as people enter stores and move through them,” Mattsson says. “My hunch is that this will be the standard mode of operation in two-three years from now.” And when this time finally arrives, no doubt Walkbase will already be busying itself with successfully anticipating the next cutting edge development for retail analytics. Walkbase’s heatmap feature gives retailers and site operators a toolset to analyse customer conversion, paths, loyalty, and other visit patterns."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-helps-farmers-to-prevent-fires-2/,Finnish startup helps farmers to prevent fires,"Finnish startup Haytech aims to prevent barn fires by providing sensors placed in hay barns. An application for IoT technology comes from one of the most traditional sectors in the world – farming. Most people outside of the farming world have no idea that hay is a major fire hazard. When hay is baled, it is at a risk of spontaneously combusting, leading to tremendous damage and costs for farmers. The sensors made by Haytech would measure the temperature and other qualities of each barn in order to predict if a barn is likely to start burning. This way, farmers will have continuous tracking of their entire inventory and be able to prevent fires before they start. Haytech measures the temperature in order to predict if a barn is likely to start burning. The solution was brought about by   – the founder of the company and a scientist at VTT  [Technical Research Centre of Finland] in Finland. She grew up in her family farm in France, and she experienced herself the process of taking care of the hay, the devastating effect a fire can have on a farm, and the huge loss and effort required by a farmer to take care of it. Years later Pesonen started studying and working in engineering and became an expert in technology that, as she figured out, can solve a lot of problems that farmers face. Switching her mindset from engineer to an entrepreneur was one of the big challenges in the beginning. Haytech’s technology has passed through a testing period and the team has already managed to prevent a farm fire. At the moment Haytech is looking for funding – the most important element in order to be able to start the production. The company already has a production partner so all that’s needed is to convince funds, private investors and angel investors to support the company. Pesonen’s ambition is to expand first in Europe and then to go globally. One of the interesting opportunities for the business is to bring in partnership with insurance companies."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-cyber-war-room-beats-hackers-at-their-own-game/,Finnish ‘Cyber War Room’ beats hackers at their own game,"As the world becomes increasingly digital, so do the threats it faces. A Finnish research laboratory has harnessed the powers of attack testing and public-private co-operation to stay one step ahead of cybercrime. There is a team of researchers in Finland who spend their days plotting complex cyber attacks. Instead of malicious purposes, these ethical hackers use their skills to detect security vulnerabilities and help companies prepare for numerous cyber threats. This is not the premise for a science fiction film, but how the   ‘Cyber War Room’ security laboratory operates. “Our cyberlab is a completely isolated space with its own mini-Internet. It is a test environment that is not connected to the outside world,” explains  , principal scientist at VTT. The Cyber War Room offers businesses and public organisations a safe environment to subject their devices and systems to highly realistic cyber attacks. Companies gain knowledge on their vulnerabilities, while VTT’s research team uses the data to develop new tools to tackle cyber threats ranging from malware to political espionage. Although Savola cannot name any of the lab’s customers for security reasons, its combination of collaborative approach and advanced technology is what makes the Cyber War Room unique. Any organisation can now have their security capabilities tested in the cyberlab instead of just relying on estimates. “Other research organisations do not have similar labs at their disposal,” says Savola. “Many security companies have their own test environments, but they focus on their own operations and enhancing their own products… There is more demand for the Cyber War Room than our capacity at the moment.” VTT represents the largest independent cybersecurity research team in Finland and a key part of its operations is international co-operation. In fact, the Cyber War Room opened a year ago as part of an EU-wide research programme ‘Safe and Secure European Routing’ (SASER). VTT led the programme’s network security-focused Finnish research group, which included industry partners   Second Nature Security, EXFO, MPY Palvelut and Intel Security. “For a malicious hacker it is enough to find one security hole, but ‘good hackers’ need to find all possible holes. It is a constant race,” says Mika Holmberg, CEO of security firm 2NS. In a project like SASER, companies both contribute to the programme’s wider goals and use the research for their own R&D. Savola believes VTT has an important role to play in supporting companies to create new business and innovations. “Small and medium size companies [SMEs] are our field. They don’t have the same research resources as big corporations and we act as their research centres,” explains Savola. “Typically we develop proof-of-concepts and prototypes in these projects and then the companies continue their commercialisation.” A prime example comes from SASER. The programme gave Helsinki-based company 2NS the tools it needed to develop its first software product, a security monitoring service called ‘Morpheus’. It alerts users to any security problems and vulnerabilities in their systems and even helps to predict upcoming cyber attacks, yet it takes only a few minutes to set up. Morpheus represents a big step for 2NS as the company previously focused solely on expert services for security testing and auditing. “We had the idea, but would we as an expert company have started to build Morpheus if we wouldn’t have received support from VTT and funding from Tekes [the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation]? Probably not,” says  , CEO of 2NS. “But now we have a globally scalable product which is unlike anything else on the market.” After its positive initial experience, 2NS is now participating in the follow-up phase of the SASER programme. This will focus on monitoring methods for next generation networks, such as 5G. Holmberg believes these kinds of programmes offer unique opportunities for SMEs. “VTT does a lot of great research in the cyber sector which we in the research programme can use for new ideas and products,” Holmberg says. “The next programme, for instance, will include adaptable, self-learning systems on which VTT has done plenty of work. We will be able to introduce these features into our new cybersecurity solutions.” Both Holmberg and Savola agree on the main strengths of the Finnish cybersecurity sector: high-level expertise and tight cooperation between companies and research organisations, all the way to governmental level. VTT’s Cyber War Room is a successful manifestation of these strengths and the plan is now to grow it into an internationally significant research resource. Demand will not be a problem: “The internet and networks are continuously expanding everywhere. Soon everything will start to communicate via the Internet – fridges, saunas, cars, buildings,” Holmberg describes. “Cybersecurity investments are needed so any security holes can be blocked from the start.” The Finnish Cyber War Room tests the capabilities of companies and public organisations to withstand various cyber attacks and cyber war scenarios."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arctic-play-is-a-game-changer-for-the-mobile-gaming-industry/,Arctic Play is a game changer for the mobile gaming industry,"Finnish game development startup Arctic Play has created a unique business model for mobile gaming that allows users to win physical rewards. ’s first game,  , was released last month in partnership with skateboarding companies Transworld Skateboarding and Skate Delux who provide physical rewards such as skateboards for players who achieve well in the game. In Hoodrip players can purchase items they see in the game, as well as win skateboarding items in different competitions or challenges. Hoodrip is a user-friendly arcade styled game, consisting of a story mode and a challenges mode where users can earn credits. These credits can be used to get discounts on items from Arctic Play’s partners. “You can skate on the skateboards in the game but you can also buy it in real life,” explains  , partner at Arctic Play. “The things you see in the game can also be shipped to your home.” In addition to being able to purchase items, users can also win different skateboarding items in competitions or challenges. The company calls this IAC (In App Contests). Companies are also able to buy media slots in   that allow their products to be placed within the game. This model allows the users to play for free, which Nyberg says will always be the case: “The game is free to play and it will be forever, we don’t have any hidden charges.” Even though Hoodrip is strictly a skateboarding game, its ability to transfer the business model to other genres makes it unique. Arctic Play aims to integrate the physical retail aspect of the game into other sports game genres. “Basically what we have done can be done in all different ways,” Nyberg explains. As skateboarding is not a mainstream sport, Arctic Play confronted some challenges while designing and launching their business model. But as challenging the launch was, most importantly the company was able to show what they were capable of. “In the future we can do other things which might even be easier to build by using our platform that is already in place,” says Nyberg. Aside from its unique business model, Arctic Play also analyses its data in a very different way to most mobile gaming companies. Data is analysed with reference to kilometres skated by users, with the amount of time users spent off the ground on their board and different aspects within the game. This allows the company to analyse both market research and the loyalty of their users. Since its launch,  ’s users have travelled a total of 60 000 kilometres and have spent a total of 31 days in the air. These statistics indicate that the game has already developed a loyal user base. This is an attractive piece of information to advertisers, which counts more than the download rate. “They [the players] stick to the game, which was one thing we noticed – not a lot of people are leaving the game,” Nyberg concludes happily. Arctic Play’s first game, Hoodrip, was released last month in partnership with skateboarding companies Transworld Skateboarding and Skate Delux."

The company thrives on establishing already successful business models and importing them around Eastern and Northern Europe. Finternet was established a year ago and focusses on digitalisation for media companies. In essence Finternet is a startup studio but without the risk of trying out completely new ideas. “Finternet takes existing and performing business models, replicates the technology in Finland, tests it and then incubates these businesses and distributes them through a series of media partnerships throughout Eastern Europe,” explains  , Finternet’s head of international business. Finternet hopes to provide media companies, who have been taking major losses in the past 10 years, new digital revenue streams. The company develops partnerships with international media companies and gives them a share in revenue of Finternet startups. In return the media companies give marketing support to the startups. “Through the marketing support we get nice online campaigns”, says Cooper. “We strongly believe that TV does work: it’s great for brand recognition and people like familiar brands.” For its startups Finternet provides the resources that are needed to accelerate growth. For example the startups are receiving support from all the departments within Finternet, which allows the startups to run with low levels of staff. “What we’re trying to do is to establish a runway for startups,” describes  , Finternet’s founder and head of operations. “What we want is to have a startup academy: you come into our company and start your own startup within Finternet.” Finternet believes that the most important aspect of a startup is having a good team. Running a startup is not an easy task and failure is sometimes held accountable to the team. “Teams run into blaming each other,” says da Costa. “Many times it ruins the relationship of the parties and this leads to the ultimate failure of the company.” According to da Costa the most important aspect of a startup is having a good team: “In the startups there is not much politics inside the company. The whole team takes the credits for the success and celebrates everyone’s achievements.” Finternet believes that timing, team and your idea are the most important elements of establishing a successful startup. “We’re still ahead of bigger and older companies because we are able to grow quicker than they are,” says  , partner and head of sales of Finternet. “We are able to react faster.” The company aims to perfect the services which it replicates and brings to market. It does this by promoting market research. Finterner is certain that by keeping up to date with the customers’ needs, the startups are able to establish a steady customer base. The company also believes in scaling the business and not overspending in areas before the market research is complete and a known customer base is targeted. “You could spend all your initial money building a concept with no customer development and then realise that you’ve done it wrong and you’ll have no money left,” Cooper stresses. Finternet wants to establish a runway for startups. Pictured (from left to right) Tommi Siro, Mikael da Costa and Giles Cooper at Finternet offices in Helsinki. Text: Ruairi O’Hehir"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/hellon-aims-for-the-top-in-service-design/,Hellon aims for the top in service design,"In the future, robotisation and artificial intelligence will replace a large proportion of service sector jobs, making service design all the more relevant. For this reason, more focus should be placed on well-functioning and solution-driven service design. This is what the international award-winning Finnish service design company Hellon believes. “If you think about robotisation and the increase in artificial intelligence, we are up against a huge shift that will create unprecedented mass unemployment predicts ,  ’s CEO and co-founder. “In the future, we will need people with creative problem-solving capacity, empathy and who can solve complex challenges.” A service designer is precisely someone who has these abilities. In service design the services of a company, or any other organisation, are designed so that the customer is as happy as possible with the service. “Processes and structures are designed around the customer, not the organisation,” explains Wäänänen. Demand for service design and its significance are continuing to grow globally. An indication of this is, for example, that an increasing number of executive groups now have a design director. Large consulting companies have also begun to buy service design companies in order to strengthen their expertise in the sector. Focusing on the customer is important in a tough competitive environment. “Today, Chinese products are equal in quality to Finnish products, so we need to find new ways to stand out from the competition. Service and, above all, customer experience are the way to stand out,” Wäänänen says. He points out that satisfied customers are likely to use a service again: “You can never stop investing in developing the customer experience. Otherwise your customers will look for another service.” Passengers were given the chance to participate in yoga and Pilates classes or practice yoga on their own at the Yoga Gate studio, which was established at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport as part of Hellon’s project improving the travel experience. Hellon believes that business in industry’s sometimes long production chains is conducted between people, not organisations. Human-centric thinking is at the core of service design. “The service design process seeks to find insight into what customers are like and how the service is connected to their everyday lives,” says Wäänänen. He illustrates the holistic customer experience using restaurant patrons: “We don’t just think about what happens when you step through the door and step out again – we consider the whole experience. When you hear about the restaurant for the first time, what happens when you consider different options, when you go to a restaurant and enjoy a meal there and how you could be a customer of the restaurant again.” Many types of teams with commercial, technological and human-centric insight are required for mapping out this understanding. Hellon’s 20-person team includes designers, ethnographers, graphical and spatial design professionals as well as engineers and commercial experts. One of Hellon’s projects was the transformation of a pharmacy chain from an illness-centred approach to a wellbeing-centred one. According to Wäänänen, the background of Finns can boost the global success of their service design expertise because the ideas of equality inherent in Nordic culture and the welfare society model are the same values and ideas that are required to achieve smooth service. “Our cultural background helps us understand what is key to providing good service,” he explains. “In a more hierarchical culture the tendency is to develop things so that they benefit yourself and few services can succeed based on that model.” Relevant expertise can attract investments, as well as the offices of international companies. Last autumn, Hellon won two of the four Global Service Design Awards up for grabs at the service design sector’s one and only annual global conference. One of the awards was presented to the company for its TravelLab project, which was aimed at making the transfer time between flights more pleasant for passengers at the Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. Passengers were able to participate in airport yoga and a Midsummer festival including dancing, birch trees and a maypole. A bicycle-powered mobile café, floor stickers showing the way to the children’s play area, information screens on the airport buses and a Finnish-themed photo backdrop were featured at the airport. Hellon’s success is boosted by its continuous research and passion to develop the field. In seven years’ time, Hellon plans to be among the seven largest service design companies in the world. Last summer, the company opened an office in London and is looking for opportunities in Asia and the US. “We have a lot of insight into what direction this sector is taking,” Wäänänen sums up. Passengers at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport could participate in Hellon’s service design project through traditional Finnish Midsummer dancing and a flower head wreath workshop. They also got to sample some Finnish superfoods."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/gamerefinery-develops-successful-formula/,Gamerefinery develops a successful formula,"Ascertaining a game’s potential is now easier than ever thanks to the use of Finnish mobile game analytics. To realise the impact that the games industry has made on the general public, one needs only to look at the figures: global revenue is predicted to top 113 billion US dollars by 2018. Amidst the deluge of new titles flooding onto the market, the number of potential hurdles and pitfalls impeding their success has increased concurrently. Nonetheless, no matter how much developers rely on testing their game for bugs throughout the production process, it is never exactly certain how things will eventuate. “There are no objective methods available to measure and optimise your game’s features and potential before you actually soft launch it,” explains  , CEO of mobile game analytics company  . “It is a huge downside of the business when companies need to spend hundreds of unnecessary hours on developing games blindfolded.” Established in 2014, GameRefinery offers foresight – a crystal ball scenario if you will – that reveals how well the mechanics of each game stack up against the App Store’s Top Grossing rankings. “We help our customers already in the design phase and continue throughout the lifecycle,” Råmark continues. “It’s like testing and optimising the commercial potential for a movie, even before you start filming it.” GameRefinery encourages developers to focus on the right things at the right time, saving both time and money. Its extensive analysis looks at more than 140 variables, taking into account new trends and feature level data. Eventually each product is assigned a Game Power Score out of 100 indicating its future prospects. The competitive heat mapping of the US App Store. The warmer the color, the more there are games in that area. The grey dots represent the top grossing 50 games. “We not only look at what kind of features the game actually has, but also at the synergies,” Råmark explains. “This means how well the different features in the games have been balanced and how well they work together. With that we can, for example, detect if you are trying to over-monetise the game, or if you are missing some social features, or some price points.” The company’s growing global client base attests to their high success rate, with the likes of  , Netease, Tilting Point and Dena listed among them. Now, having well and truly found its feet as a consultancy company, it’s time for GameRefinery’s next phase. “We are introducing a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform to the market,” Råmark states. “This enables us to scale up the business and companies of all sizes can enjoy our service.” The idea for GameRefinery originally came from brothers   and  , who developed the methodology together after earlier using similar methods in more mature industries. Having added Råmark as company CEO in 2014, the trio is already looking to the horizon beyond the SaaS launch. “There are opportunities in the PC games and console games industries,” Råmark states. “And, if we look at the bigger picture, there are also possibilities to expand outside the games industry.” Råmark is quick to point out that while Gamerefinery is still in its infancy, its lofty ambitions aren’t too far out of reach. “We are at the start of our journey,” he reflects. “Our goal is that we will be able to make Game Power Score the industry standard for the measuring the mobile game industry. There is currently no such thing on the market. The possibilities are very big.” GameRefinery’s extensive analysis looks at more than 140 variables, taking into account new trends and feature level data."

It’s a rare breed of person who doesn’t succumb to the Monday morning blues.  , it must be said, is one such individual. For him this much-derided day is met much like any other of the week: tinged with excitement. Pohjala has felt this way ever since getting behind the wheel of emerging startup  a couple of years ago, leaving a seasoned career at Nokia in his dust. “Every day is different – that’s why Monday mornings are not such a bad thing,” the company’s CEO and partner enthuses down the line from his Tampere office, on a typically chilly start to the Finnish working week. “It’s an exciting future ahead.” Certainly it is – Eximap is strategically parked in a space that’s set to take off for the automotive industry. Based in Finland’s third-largest city, Eximap focuses on cloud services and smartphone applications. Targeting those who seek immediate and personal car-related services on their smartphones, its   enables users to find the nearest service stations, repair workshops and spare parts. “The whole automotive industry is undergoing its biggest change in its 130-year history,” says Eximap’s CEO Pasi Pohjala. “Digitalisation is now impacting on car aftermarket services, big time,” Pohjala states. “The whole automotive industry is undergoing its biggest change in its 130-year history.” Pohjala compares this shift to that experienced by the travel industry, with customers now expecting to find the best service provider easily and quickly online. “It’s a good time business-wise to bring this onto the market,” he says. Automopus sets out to benefit both drivers and service providers alike, as the driving experience becomes increasingly digitalised. “We have a lot of data in our cloud about cars that have been registered with Automopus,” Pohjala states. “We know when your car needs a service, and can enable service providers to get in touch with you proactively at the right time with the right offer. This ease is the key thing.” The flip side of this of course means that service providers also have a personalised targeted marketing channel with which to reach driving consumers. Eximap is also exploring other options for its free service that tap into the app’s potential, including keeping a diary of fuel consumption. “We have a long list of features that we will test and see how end users react and accept them,” Pohjala says. “That’s the only way how we can make Automopus better.” Eximap has secured 350 000 euros in funding since firing up the ignition three years ago. Now, the company is staring at the open road, with international growth beckoning on the horizon. “Markets like Germany are already big; the car is central part of your life there,” Pohjala observes. “We are looking at a new round of investment later this year to enter Germany.” And how do they hope to stand out in the crowded rush hour that is Central Europe’s business environment? “Our Nordic flavour should help us,” Pohjala admits. “Also, if you can’t show you aren’t changing things and adding value in your own market, then it is difficult to get German consumers and businesses interested.” This shouldn’t be a problem, a point that Pohjala is keen to drive home. Eximap’s ranks have now swollen to 11 employees, directly reflecting customer enthusiasm for its ideas. “We try to be innovative in everything we do.” Eximap has secured 350 000 euros in funding since firing up the ignition three years ago.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/kisko-labs-benefits-remote-work/,Kisko Labs benefits from remote work,"In the startup community remote working has become a widespread phenomenon. But what are the things that should be taken into account with remote collaboration? Setting up a remote working team, raises many questions: is it really possible to work together without physically being in the same location? And how can you work effectively with only little face-to-face interaction? Finnish digital business consulting company   tells how they have solved the communications problems that remote work can cause. “At the outset, there are founders or co-founders who come up with a business idea, a vision, and assemble a team to execute the idea,” says  , founder of Kisko Labs. “The new startup company needs to clearly define and share the common purpose and goals with all team members. In other words, companies must ensure that everybody is in the same boat, rowing together towards the same destination.” “The new startup company needs to clearly define and share the common purpose and goals with all team members,” says Antti Akonniemi. In the past, companies would often frame a printed mission statement and hang it in a place easily visible for all team members. People felt engaged when they were told why and how the company’s purpose and goals were in their own and the team’s best interest. But that’s all gone as the Generation X and the Millennials want something more from their work: “Much ink has been spilled about Generation X and the Millennials search for “meaningful work”; to them, this means a pay check is not enough,” explains Akonniemi. “Mission matters and they want to be engaged in its definition and its fulfilment. In our rapidly evolving digital age, a formal, top-down approach no longer fits the bill. A more interactive approach must be instituted.” Startup company CEOs and team leaders, usually with limited capital and resources, must encourage the development and contribution of each team member’s unique talents and personal strengths. One team member can often see opportunities or threats that fellow team members cannot. Encouraging involvement also means that team members should each understand their individual responsibility for their role in the whole team’s success. And they must be empowered to make real, actionable suggestions and contributions. What comes to internal communications, Kisko Labs has given up email and Skype and they are using the phone as little as possible. For everyday communications and ‘water cooler talk’ Kisko’s team is using Flowdock, which is similar to Slack. “We mainly need the office simply to have workshops with our clients,” Akonniemi says. “One of the biggest advantages that we see is that we have reduced the need for meetings and there is much less info noise because all the important data is kept in written form” “Actually what has happened is that there is rather a significant increase of the quality of info. Nobody’s interested in creating noise in the team chat room as they are only focused on one thing: their work.” Even when no one is required to come to the Kisko Lab office every day, most people still show up just to be around colleagues or to have a quick game of table hockey."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/blooming-s-mindfulness-app-aims-prevent-burnouts/,Blooming’s mindfulness app aims to prevent burnout,"Finnish startup Blooming is only a few months old, but it is aiming high. The company wants mindfulness meditation to become as popular as doing physical exercise.  sleeps better, stresses out less, and generally has more confidence in life than earlier. His working memory and concentration skills function well, seeking perspective comes more naturally than before, and walking in other people’s shoes – figuratively – is easier than it used to be. The changes started occurring a few years ago as a result of daily meditating. Ranta started to contemplate that the so-called mindfulness meditation could help others like him, who in their busy daily lives do not have time to stop. “A relatively small number of people know what mindfulness is about, and an even smaller group is devoted to doing it regularly,” says Ranta. “However, meditation is a bit like exercise in the sense that it is beneficial mainly if practised regularly.” When founding  , Ranta and co-founders   and   were trying to figure out ways to both concretise the effects of meditation and make it a part of people’s daily routines.  , came up with an idea of monitoring the measurable changes in the human body, coaching, and a mobile application that offers support and reminds people about meditation even when they are too busy to remember it. “We wondered how things are communicated to people in this day and age. Having measurable components included makes the message less abstract.” Blooming focuses on companies. Ranta says that the goal is to offer an easy tool to increase employees’ wellbeing. “We want to help companies support their employees and prevent things like burnout.” Blooming’s service consists of personal mindfulness meditation coaching, a social component which refers to a peer group, and an application that gives each user a weekly meditation programme comprising different types of exercises. The user’s stress levels will be measured at the beginning and the end of every programme to show the progress. Initially the users wore a headband that was used for measuring how meditation affected the electrical activity of the brain. However, tests proved that the headband did not work well enough, so it is no longer included in the package. “Unfortunately technology is just not ready for it yet,” says Ranta. The eight-week programme helps users fit meditation into their daily routines. The first test users started using the service at the end of last year, and their feedback is now used in developing the product further. The process is supported by a 300 000-euro seed investment from Lifeline Ventures and Reaktor Ventures. Ranta believes that the investors were convinced by not only the experienced team, but also the fact that in the US – and to some extent in Finland – meditation has become almost a movement. Blooming founders from left to right: Riku Lindholm, Kristian Ranta and Albert Nazander. The modern human does not lack in stimuli. Ranta mentions that when done properly, mindfulness meditation can bring up things that have previously been hidden in mind’s corners. “If one is living on autopilot, work is really busy and free time packed with activities, there is not time to stop and think about feelings. Through meditation it is possible to stop and get to know what is going on inside.” Ranta has heard of cases in which, for example, someone working in an investment bank is meditating, realises that they are working in the wrong field – and resigns. In that sense, mindfulness meditation might not be a risk-free employee benefit. “Meditation can bring about psychologically challenging situations, but in the long run the effects are positive, at least to the individual.” In today’s office jobs, things like smartphones cause constant distraction. According to Ranta, meditation can help strike a balance in the middle of the flow of disruptions. He believes that soon seeking for the calm and quiet will be a mainstream hobby. “We extend from just training the body to training the mind as well,” he explains. Ranta says that in the US, particularly in the IT-focused state of California, mindfulness is a lot better known and more popular than in Finland. The parent company of Blooming is in the US, and sales efforts are already gathering speed. The parent company of Blooming is in the US, and sales efforts are already ongoing. Blooming is currently recruiting a mindfulness coach for the US market. The company is eyeing Europe and particularly the Nordic countries. However, first the team wants to finish the product properly and let it out for the inaugural pilot customers to use. ”We are strictly focusing on making the product as ready as possible. First we want to get the show on the road and then plan potential directions for growth.” Blooming’s eight-week programme helps users fit meditation into their daily routines."

Designed as a stepping stone for new businesses in particular, Helsinki’s newest startup space is the world’s first successor to the US version. “We are not merely a workspace and we did not want to create yet another accelerator,” says   one of the two developers of the Microsoft Flux community in Helsinki. “We are somewhere between a playground and a café equipped with a 3D printer.” Jakamo, which improves information sharing between companies, values Flux’s open culture. Pictured here are the co-founders, Anssi Uitto and Jarl Matti Anttila. The vision was to make Flux an inspiring and flexible space that is open for everyone. It is a good place for new entrepreneurs to start playing around with their ideas and meet other entrepreneurs struggling with similar problems. “We want people to utilise open spaces,” says  , the other man behind Flux. “The most dangerous thing startups can do is lock themselves in a boardroom to hone their idea.” In the startup space, two permanent employees provide technical support and advice on how to transform an idea into business. Flux’s broad technology offer ranges from 3D printers to laser cutters. Startups can test or borrow different technological gadgets to see if they suit their needs. The space also serves as a venue for various events and training sessions. More than 40 events have already been booked before midsummer. In addition, Flux offers meeting facilities for its users: for example, an entirely yellow boardroom can be booked for a 30-minute meeting. , a company developing social mobile games whose Last Planets game runs on a Microsoft platform, has found its way to Flux. According to Toni Nylund from a mobile game company Vulpine Games, it is easy to book a boardroom for meetings at Flux. “We want gamers to be able to form a gaming community and have social interaction also when playing mobile games,” says CEO  . “To date, this has only been possible with PC games.” Last Planets has been soft launched in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Iceland and South Africa. “We have received a lot of good and constructive feedback,” Nylund says. “I dare to say that we will have a global launch by the end of 2016.” Another company using Flux and its meeting rooms is  . The company has developed a day-to-day tool for industrial companies to share information in an easy way. “We do have our own office, but here we can ask others for their opinion,” says  , Jakamo CMO and co-founder. “This place fosters a culture of sharing and we can also bring our customers here.” Jakamo also engages in technology collaboration with Microsoft. However, those who do not use Microsoft technology are also welcome to Flux. “This space is really meant for everyone,” says Dodik. “A busload of retirees provides an excellent opportunity to test one’s pitches!” The idea for Flux comes from San Francisco, where Microsoft designed and launched its new startup concept, Reactor. “We looked into how we could best support the local developer communities,” says Microsoft’s  , who was involved in developing Reactor. “We wanted to create a space that is open to everyone free of charge and to be as flexible as possible. Because technology develops quickly, the needs of startups also change all the time.” Microsoft plans to open up similar spaces around the world and create collaboration between the companies using them. Microsoft was attracted by Finland’s vibrant startup ecosystem. ”Finland has fantastic engineering skills, fantastic education, and it has advanced technologies,” sums up  , Global Partnerships Director of the Microsof Acceleratos programme. Flux has been designed to offer high flexibility and can host events for up to a hundred people. Two Flux employees guide the entrepreneurs using the space. Mohammad Bakharzy provides technical support and Annie Talvasto, who knows the Finnish startup scene inside and out, provides support on the business side of things."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lifa-air-s-technology-freshens-air-chinese-homes/,Lifa Air’s technology freshens up air in Chinese homes,"Finnish company Lifa Air is helping the Chinese people breathe amidst the country’s massive problem with pollution. Co-operation with China’s leading sound system manufacturer Edifier takes Lifa Air’s air purifiers into the biggest market in the world. While in Finland citizens can feel a little coughy because of street dust, in Shanghai, China people might not see further than a few metres ahead of them. There are dozens of cities in the rapidly growing country that have more inhabitants than the whole of Finland. “You can really feel the smog in your lungs,” says  , the CEO of  . ”The problem is serious and people talk about it daily.” Lifa Air, founded in Finland in 1988, heard the Chinese consumers’ call for air purifiers, but alone the company would not have had the resources to conquer a whole new market. Chinese Edifier joined along through Golden Bridge programme by Finpro. Brandt explains that the multimedia audio manufacturer had been looking for a new business segment in the hope of further growth, and they had acknowledged the potential of air cleaning. After their first date things proceeded quickly. In August last year a joint venture called Lifa Air (Dongguan) Air Purification System Co Ltd was founded, the ownership of which is divided 30 per cent and 70 per cent between Lifa Air and Edifier respectively. The first products were presented to the press in October, and consumers have been able to buy them from January onwards. The company targets the Chinese middle and upper middle class. “The customers are city people who worry about the quality of the air they breathe and who have the purchase price, about a thousand dollars, to spare,” Brandt describes. The air purifier system that has landed on the Chinese consumer market consists of an air purifier and a measurement and control unit called Lifa Smart. Lifa Smart constantly measures, for example, the amount of particulates and carbon dioxide in the air, and it controls the air purifier according to these parameters. The indoor air quality can be monitored with a mobile app. Lifa Air’s air purifier’s minimalistic design is distinctively Scandinavian in style. Lifa Air’s own business revolves around professional devices. Brandt points out that one of the essential differences between professional and consumer markets lies in their volume. “Edifier has the skills and resources for mass production; Lifa Air provides the knowhow.” In addition to the joint venture in China, LIfa Air has offices in Dubai, Hong Kong, and New York City. Approximately three quarters of the revenue comes from abroad. The professional solutions have been sold in more than 50 countries, and Lifa Air has a network of distributors in 30 countries. Brandt says that once the Chinese need has been met, consumer products will hit the markets elsewhere. The most promising areas are Europe and the Middle East: not only do they need air purification, but they also have a suitable legislation and infrastructure. “For example, in Dubai the conditions are challenging with plenty of skyscrapers and sand flying around. The air simply has to be cleaned.” Brandt sees immense opportunities for expansion. Also India and Pakistan are countries with plenty of people and big metropolises – and bad air quality. Latin America boasts an abundance of similar cities, but Brandt thinks that finding customers in the area might be a different story. Brandt says that the biggest competitor of Lifa Air’s professional solutions is simply doing duct cleaning mechanically. In terms of devices, the intensity of competition varies product by product. The competition is harsher outside of Finland. Making successful business in Finland was one of the prerequisites of Lifa Air believing the same could happen abroad. “If the carrots do not sell in your local market, they will not sell elsewhere either,” says Brandt. Lifa Air was founded in 1988 by two brothers,  and  . The company continues to be full-on Finnish: the professional products are designed and manufactured in Finland, and all subcontractors are Finnish too. The minimalistic design is distinctively Scandinavian in style. Nowadays Lifa Air has nearly thousand employees, and growth is happening both in Finland and abroad. New team members are currently being recruited. Brandt himself joined the company a little over a year ago, and the founding brothers are both still involved, Pentti Mäkipää on the board of directors and Vesa Mäkipää as the president of the Asian region. There are plenty of plans for the future, but Brandt is not yet willing to go into detail. He does say that new devices and solutions to help decrease workload are being developed all the time. “IoT, the internet of things, will change a lot of things. Currently we are looking into different ways of making use of it in air purification.” Finnish air purifier company Lifa Air is helping the Chinese people breathe amidst the country’s massive problem with pollution."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/zemeho-music-ears-gamers/,Zemeho is music to the ears of gamers,"Sustaining a youthful mix is all about creating choices for this Oulu startup. It seems that truly iconic musical themes are few and far between these days in the games world. Sure, the catchy beeps of  . and   are lodged firmly in the memory banks for many, so too the rousing grandeur of  . But if one were to be perfectly honest, the volume of truly compelling tunes produced recently has been a little low frequency. According to Oulu-based startup  there might just be a very good reason for some games studios not investing too heavily in their latest soundtracks. “We observed youth playing their mobile games and noticed they all had their earphones in,” explains company CEO  . “The majority of them tend to listen to their own music.” Valinta is Zemeho’s music streaming plug-in service for casual mobile gamers, doing away with the need for leap-frogging between apps in order to cue up their favourite tunes. All users need do is click on the embedded V icon whilst playing and swiftly choose from a range of genre specific playlists. And then return their focus to the game at hand. Taking its name from the Finnish word for ‘choice’, not only is Valinta made with under 21s in mind, it has also been designed by youth. In fact, the lion’s share of Zemeho’s innovations come from its 17-year-old concept designer and global pitcher. “Zemeho mixes today’s youth with senior business professionals such as myself and other cofounders,” says Zemeho’s CEO River Boche. “Zemeho mixes today’s youth with senior business professionals such as myself and other cofounders,” Boche explains. “Youth have always come up with the ideas. They were the first to use Snapchat, WhatsApp and Viber, for example.” Zemeho first revealed this youthful approach at startup hub Slush in 2014. “We took the conceptual idea and pitched it to major gaming execs,” Boche recalls. “They understood that the youth prefer their own music and that it’s expensive for indie developers to acquire music for their games, and also that it’s a disruptive business model.” The subsequent road to success has been swift. When the plug-in service was launched in Fingersoft Games’  back in January, the response was unprecedented. “We had 15 to 18 000 genre selections on the first day, and nearly 150 000 songs played,” Boche states. “It was really compelling. This really showed that the end users would play their own music if given the opportunity.” A month later the number of songs selected had already topped three million. Unsurprisingly, these huge numbers have had the desired effect. “It has really opened up the eyes of the streaming music industry and record labels themselves,” Boche states. “We are in discussions with some of them. They would really like to penetrate the gaming industry, because there are one billion gamers out there.” With Valinta now well and truly up and running, Boche emphasises that the service will remain free for gaming studios and also the end users. Monetisation is set to come from ads and promotions, along with revenue sharing with record labels and the streaming industry. All of this suggests that Zemeho is just a few songs in to what promises to be a memorable playlist – if one may use such an analogy. “This is just the beginning; our future is also in normal apps too,” Boche states. “We are in talks with major sports and social media apps to provide the plug-in service. There is a big future in combining music with gaming and mobile apps.” Facing the music is (l to r) Zemeho’s Ossi Juusola, River Boche, Dean Boche and Kimmo Kuusipalo."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-art-of-the-start-a-survival-guide-to-set-up-a-startup/,The art of the start: A survival guide for setting up a startup,"Miika Perä has seen the first steps and battles of three different startups. For him entrepreneurship is a natural way of working with things he deems important. The hardest part is to begin. And in a startup everything is about, well, starting. “There’s always a jump to make, but once it’s down, entrepreneurship becomes a part of life. It is important to reach that point.”  speaks from experience. The drinkable supermeal company  took its first steps in Perä’s kitchen, and he is one of the founders of   a company that produces designer smoke alarms. Now those companies are led by others, and Perä focuses his efforts on   in London, UK. Together with his co-founder  , whom Perä met through an accelerator program, Perä aims at making Cambrian Intelligence one of the frontrunners of robotics. The main idea behind the company is to bring an almost science fiction sounding solution to decommission old nuclear reactors. Simultaneously Perä and Zaheri are developing technology and solutions that can be taken advantage of outside of nuclear plants, including everyday life and things like remote work. “At some point things will develop all the way to the level that was seen in the movie Avatar, but we are not there yet. Still, technology already enables transformational things.” Perä’s background is in finance and bioinformation technology, both of which he holds a degree in. His first fellow entrepreneurs were found through studies. He deems two people an ideal team size for the founding period. “Of course there are people who soldier on their own, and three is possible as well. The best thing would be to have both genders presented. The differences in the ways of thinking brutally increase the IQ of the team.” Perä points out that getting into a company with a friend might, at worst, mean the end of friendship. Hence it is essential to agree on the vision in as much detail as possible. “Obviously at first the friendship seems unbreakable, yet still drama is not uncommon in the world of entrepreneurship.” Perä describes Jalo Helsinki as a good learning curve that prepared him for hardship, too. For example, he begun to understand that whilst the company is battling its way to the next goal, the world will change. That opens new opportunities that did not even exist earlier. “Really small details can be in control of large things, both in the good and the bad. It is almost beautiful how the tiniest idea or a contact to someone can open a big door that changes everything.” Miika Perä deems two people an ideal team size for the founding period of a startup. Perä also thinks that it would be good to have both genders presented as the differences in the ways of thinking brutally increase the IQ of the team. The ability to keep going when times are hard is fundamental for entrepreneurs. Perä has noticed that a lot of people give up too easily. It can also be dangerous to fall too much in love with one’s own ideas, as that compromises flexibility. Knowing one’s own monsters is important, too. By monster, Perä means the bottleneck that needs to be cleared in order for things to go forward – say, convincing the conservative nuclear industry to give new technologies a go. “My personal weakness is that suddenly I get another idea I start to ponder over. It is easy to do something completely irrelevant that feels like it is pushing things further, but in reality it is meaningless unless the monster is defeated. Investors will take notice if the road is not clear.” It is beneficial for just about anyone to examine the limits of one’s own prejudices. Perä mentions that all things will, with time and effort, be easy – if only you give yourself a chance to learn them. The current generation of entrepreneurs has grown up in a working life very different to that of their predecessors. Perä has noted that when before hitting foreign markets was deemed cumbersome, today’s startups tend to think globally by default. Money is the first worry for many. Perä points out that it is possible to go pretty far just by making use of pre-existing resources. Of course soon there needs to be someone willing to pay for what the company is providing. “If not, it turns into a project, a hobby.” Miika encourages all budding entrepreneurs to ask themselves, whether or not the idea is something that would be motivating enough without pay. If the answer is yes, you know you are in the right direction. Speaking of which – what would Perä do if money was no issue? Without a hint of hesitation he responds: “Exactly this. The work has a meaning, because it can be used for common good.” “Giving someone that “wow!” experience – that feels incredible.” Cambrian Intelligence’s goal is to bring elements known from science fiction to everyday life."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/armada-interactive-grabs-gaming-industry-attention-with-usd-3m-funding/,Armada Interactive grabs gaming industry attention with USD 3 million funding,"There is a new rising star on the Finnish mobile gaming map. Armada Interactive is barely nine-months old, but has already raised three million dollars in seed financing to finalise its secretive gaming project. “We will bring a user experience [UX] innovation to mobile gaming,” says  , co-founder of  . “It is in a game we are working on, but it can be used in many game types and genres. This has never been seen before on any game or platform.” They sound like big claims, but Armada has attracted notable backing. The startup’s funding round was led by London-based Initial Capital and joined by a group of European and US gaming funds including Index Ventures, Profounders Capital, Backed, Reaktor Ventures, Sisu Game Ventures as well as angel investors   and  . Syvähuoko believes this could be the largest initial investment ever secured by a Finnish gaming company. It is a laudable feat considering Armada has yet to announce its first game and the whole round was closed just three months after the company was formed in September 2015. “This is a new venture with its first project so we will use the funding to create everything the company needs, starting with office infrastructure,” Syvähuoko explains. “We also have recruitment open all the time, particularly for game developers.” Armada is already well set up with a diverse team (Syvähuoko counts seven nationalities) of 20 employees based in Helsinki, many of whom are gaming industry veterans. Notably Syvähuoko and co-founders  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   previously worked on such gaming successes as  ,  ,   and  . Sharing information brings huge benefits to everyone. Whether it is on game design, marketing or funding, we all share experiences with each other. I have not seen anything similar in another country. But when asked about Armada’s gaming innovation Syvähuoko goes quiet. He says all will be revealed with the company’s first mobile game which will be flexible enough to appeal to both casual and core gamers. “Our innovation is our competitive advantage, but it is not something that is impossible to copy,” Syvähuoko mysteriously explains. “We want to be very close to publishing our first game before we show anything. This way we will hit the market first, even if someone tries to copy us.” In fact all Syvähuoko will say is that the new UX makes it possible to bring the look and (most importantly) feel of high quality PC games to mobile. The focus is on standout visuals, a transparent free-to-play model and engaging real-time multi-player experience. “Our games will be easy to access and play while waiting for a bus, but their worlds and narratives will be more immersive and slightly more tailored to adult taste than is typical in mobile games,” Syvähuoko outlines. “Our innovation makes it possible for the first time to bring these gaming experiences to mobile devices in a seamless way.” “If the game we are working on was built with traditional methods, it would not be suitable for mobile devices,” says Samuli Syvähuoko. Syvähuoko has long roots in the Finnish gaming industry. He co-founded one of the country’s first international gaming success, Remedy Entertainment, back in 1995, and believes the subsequent successes of Supercell and Rovio in Finland are no coincidence. “I truly believe this is the mecca of mobile gaming,” Syvähuoko says. “We have many top quality founding teams, I would argue more than in any other country per capita. There is about the same number of well-funded, high class mobile games studios in the UK as in Finland – but the countries have very different population sizes.” So what is Finland’s secret sauce? Syvähuoko cites the strong demo scene, Nokia’s early investments in mobile gaming and the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes) which has helped many startups through their financially challenging early days.  But the most weight he puts on the gaming industry’s community spirit: “Sharing information brings huge benefits to everyone,” Syvähuoko explains. “Whether it is on game design, marketing or funding, we all share experiences with each other. I have not seen anything similar in another country.” Collaboration has also become increasingly crucial as the gaming market has become more crowded. A good game is no longer enough to stand out from competition so Armada comes prepared: “This is why we have built a solid team and funding early on,” Syvähuoko says. “We want to maximise the probability of reaching the top and not just rely on luck. If everything goes as we hope, we will lead a major disruption in mobile gaming.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jungle-juice-bar-slays-dragons-as-it-eyes-global-success/,Jungle Juice Bar slays dragons as it eyes global success,"‘Freshness, wellbeing and social responsibility’ are the three pillars of Finnish smoothie bar firm Jungle Juice Bar. Now the company has made the first steps to take its refreshing approach abroad. ‘Travel broadens your horizons’ the saying goes. But for   founder  it ignited a completely new career running Finland’s largest chain of juice and smoothie bars. At Jungle Juice Bar fast food means fresh juices and smoothies with superfoods and no added sugar. “We used to travel a lot with my husband and run into all kinds of juice places abroad and wondered why these haven’t landed in Finland,” Fagerström recalls. “I wanted to bring here the idea that you can add protein and various superfoods into drinks.” Inexperience in the industry did not slow Fagerström down. On the contrary, she enrolled to study entrepreneurship, created the business concept together with husband   and opened the very first Jungle Juice Bar in early 2011. It has been a fast ride ever since. Today the company has 15 locations across Finland, employs 110 people and opened its first international juice bar in Spain at the start of the year. The concept behind Jungle Juice Bar is simple, but effective: bring healthy fast food to busy locations. Customers are offered drinks with fresh ingredients, no added sugar and a wide menu with wild sounding names such as Green Hornet and Berry Baboon. While fresh juices have become a diet staple for health conscious consumers, the market was very different when Jungle Juice Bar launched: “At the start we were warned that no one drinks this kind of stuff,” Fagerstöm laughs. “It took time and effort to build our brand, but now people recognise us very well. The awareness of healthy foods has increased and people are much more interested in it than five years ago.” Jungle Juice Bar’s next focus is Europe. Spain is just the first step for the company which plans to introduce its toucan logo to the other side of the Atlantic. With hindsight Jungle Juice Bar has had good timing, but the company’s success has also been driven by plenty of sweat and ‘can do’ attitude. In 2012, the company’s rapid expansion led to increasing financial strain and its founders started to look for investors to support their growth plans. Fagerström even participated in the Finnish version of   to pitch the business idea to investors on national TV. It was a success. Jungle Juice Bar raised 60 000 euros and gained two new investors to join its three existing backers. While the funding has been crucial for the company, Fagerström values the expertise an investor can bring to the table high above a large wallet: “When you run a company yourself, and have never done it before, it is a long road to take,” Fagerström says. “Some lessons you learn the hard way. But when the right investors have come into the picture, there has been a very professional touch. You make fewer missteps.” Fagerström is not one for sitting still. As Jungle Juice Bar has grown, so has Fagerström’s family and her third child was born in April. This has seen the whole family return to Helsinki after moving to Malaga to open the company’s first juice bar outside Finland. Madrid is next up on the expansion list, but Fagerstrom is staying put this time. International expansion was on the cards for Jungle Juice Bar from day one, hence the English name and brand. Fagerström’s advice to anyone starting their own business is to invest time and effort into creating their brand: “A concept, brand and visual image are all very important,” Fagerström stresses. “Many people just take a name and a logo without really thinking about it, but this can become a stumbling block later. It is hard to create a brand afterwards.” Another key lesson for Fagerström has been the crucial role locations play in the retail industry. Jungle Juice Bar learnt this the expensive way when it had to close down its shop at the Helsinki airport. “We were eager to go to any good location and thought people at a busy airport would want to take healthy drinks with them,” Fagerström explains. “But we were on the wrong side of the security check [where liquids aren’t allowed]. It is worth it to really focus and spend time on researching the right locations.” Jungle Juice Bar’s next focus is Europe. Spain is just the first step for the company which plans to introduce its toucan logo to the other side of the Atlantic. “In the future I see us in many countries across Europe and even in the US. I don’t know the exact timeframe for this to happen, but this is the goal we aim to achieve,” Fagerström concludes. Every year Jungle Juice Bar introduces several charity smoothies in collaboration with Finnish celebrities and donates majority of the proceeds to different causes.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nixu-makes-internet-secure-proposition/,Nixu makes the Internet a secure proposition,"The growing variety of threats to IT security represents an expansive future for this Finnish company. Overlooking the sea in the Espoo suburb of Keilaniemi, it seems somehow fitting that a world globe is situated inside the meeting room at  ’s office. “Our strategy is to be the trusted go-to partner for cyber security services in Northern Europe, which we define by the area north of the Alps,” explains company CEO  . “Our mission is to keep the digital society running, making sure that everything is built in a secure and resilient manner.” After spending close to three decades nurturing a local client base that includes 60 of the top 100 Finnish companies, Nixu began fixing its gaze abroad at the end of last year. “Holland was a nice place to start,” Kairinen explains. “It is an English-speaking market, so we can provide support with the Finnish experts that we have here. Also it’s quite competitive, so it provides a nice benchmark on how we do against the competition.” Now, after gaining traction in Holland, the next stage of Nixu’s growth strategy has seen it acquire Swedish specialised IT security firm Europoint Networking AB. Rest assured this probably won’t be last time we hear about the company’s expansion strategy in 2016. Such growth is nothing new for Nixu. Back when Kairinen commenced working at the company in 2006, there were a mere 15 information security people on the books. A decade later there are 170 ‘Nixuans’ and annual revenue has topped 18 million euros. Nixu’s favourable positioning is heightened by a new EU privacy regulation: big sanctions wait for companies that lose EU citizen’s privacy data. “We are one of the largest teams in this area,” Kairinen says. “Building up trust in this field is really important. Once you work with someone you get a good reputation, which helps going forward with other companies.” Nixu has done so across three main target segments: corporate IT, digital business and the Industrial Internet. “Corporate IT needs to protect corporate secrets, keep emails secure and the corporate network protected,” Kairinen explains. “Then, with e-commerce transactions, how do you provide extranet portals for your partners and how do you integrate everything together in a safe and secure manner?” Finally, Nixu’s Industrial Internet protection portfolio relates to “industrial control systems, factory automation and all the critical infrastructure you have, and how to protect that.” Kairinen points out that one of the most problematic areas for cyber security across the board is the increasingly skilled and aggressive tactics of hackers. “If a client gets hacked, or has a data breach, we start looking at the digital tracks left and help them recover, and try and find out what happened and if something was stolen,” Kairinen explains. “We also monitor the client network. We have these watch post technology sensors and notice if something is happening.” Such pre-emptive surveillance is becoming the norm for companies. Simply building a firewall around their network and hoping for the best is not enough protection any more. “You need to watch over and react quickly,” Kairinen states. “Companies will invest more in real time monitoring in the future. We are in a good spot.” Nixu’s favourable positioning is also heightened by a new EU privacy regulation that was approved last year. “There are quite big sanctions for companies that lose EU citizen’s privacy data,” Kairinen explains. “If there’s a leak you face big consequences. Companies need to be aware of what is happening – that’s business for us.” Nixu’s strategy is to be the trusted go-to partner for cyber security services in Northern Europe."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arcusys-offers-digital-tools-to-solve-the-inhabitation-of-mars/,Arcusys offers digital tools to help inhabit Mars,"The transformation of digital learning seems to be the next success story for Finnish education and technology company Arcusys is already making it happen.  knows what a learning curve is. In 13 years the company has transformed from an idea by four unemployed friends to one of the fastest growing tech companies in Finland with 110 employees and a collaboration with US space agency NASA. A big part of the credit goes to Arcusys’ focus on the digitalisation of learning. “Previously digital learning meant taking traditional classroom teaching and moving it online,” says  , Arcusys CEO and co-founder. “However the ‘digitalisation of learning’ means getting measurable data from every single learning experience. Teachers get real-time information on what people have learnt.” Consequently deep analytics form the core of Arcusys’ digital learning platform Valamis. The platform, launched in 2010, offers a social learning environment where analytics tools monitor everything from content creation and interactive lessons to peer reviews and digital exams. The data is used to create a personalised learning path for each student. “Previously you could see if someone has completed a course, now we can see whether a specific page has been read,” explains Hurskainen. “We can detect early if someone is not using the materials and offer help; and teachers can better support both those who risk falling behind and those who already know the topic well.” This approach can be tailored for various educational purposes across schools and universities as well as companies for professional certifications and sales training. In addition to analytics, Arcusys is also deeply committed to researching new pedagogical methods. In particular the company is advocating ‘phenomenon-based learning’, a method widely used in Finland, where teaching is built around real-life events instead of individual, disconnected subjects. The goal is to increase students’ learning motivation, effectiveness and problem solving skills. “For instance, in a vocational school the phenomenon could be buying a car. The material teaches how a car works and car ownership, but at the same time the student learns how loans and interest rates work,” Hurskainen says. “You learn many things simultaneously without thinking you are studying physics, mathematics and economics.” Arcusys employs 110 people in its headquarters in Joensuu, Eastern Finland, and other offices in Oulu, Lappeenranta, Helsinki, Petrozavodsk in Russia and Boston in the US. This method is also applied to something more extraterrestrial. A new door opened to Arcusys a year ago when contacts at the University of New York wanted to introduce the company to NASA. The meeting was a success and led to collaboration with the space agency to create a global learning and research environment for astronauts, academics and students interested in space science. The first step in the collaboration uses Valamis to digitalise and expand NASA’s ‘Epic Challenge’ education program. Traditionally the program was conducted in classrooms to encourage interest in space sciences by solving epic problems, such as sustainable habitation of Mars. “NASA has had good results, but it also wanted to try this online and involve people from different continents,” says Hurskainen. “We helped them find partners in Joensuu [Eastern Finland] and students, from high schools to university level, to research issues like growing plants on Mars and how virtual reality can support astronauts in space.” A group of Finnish students even got an opportunity of a lifetime to virtually meet astronaut  , who answered questions via a video stream straight from the International Space Station (ISS). Now Arcusys is working with NASA to digitally expand Epic Challenge programme firstly to universities across Finland and then internationally. The NASA partnership reflects the growth of Arcusys. While most of its current customers are Finnish companies, universities and public institutions, 80 per cent of new business comes from elsewhere in Europe and the US. Reflecting this Arcusys opened its first US office in March last year and has found interest in Finland’s well regarded education system to be a particular door opener. “In many countries people want to see if some of it can be implemented in their country,” Hurskainen confirms. Alongside its international plans Arcusys is working on the further development of Valamis. The company has already trialed augmented reality and Hurskainen believes the next big trend in education, for both school and enterprise environments, will be social (peer) learning. This will see the role of top-down information reduced as students are encouraged to discuss and research topics together. “We want to help to change how people are educated and bring phenomenon-based thinking and digitalisation to learning everywhere,” Hurskainen concludes. Valamis platform combines advanced analytics and new pedagogical methods from gamification to phenomenon-based learning."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/playmore-games-brings-mobile-technology-board-games/,Playmore Games brings mobile technology to board games,"The best thing about board games is playing them – not learning how to play them. Finnish Playmore Games solves the problem by bringing to the table a mobile application that functions as the friend who already knows the game and can teach others.  , the CEO of  , does not think that the rising popularity of board games means people are bored with the digital world. The different ways of playing are used for different things. “People who play video games mainly stare at the screen, whereas a board game is in the middle and people surround it sitting face–to-face,” says Jussila. “Board games are about spending time together, and that is a part of being human.” Jussila and co-founder   created the concept of the   in order to bring digital conveniences to board games. The first feature the mobile app will have is teaching the rules of the game whilst playing the game – without first having to spend an hour reading through the rulebook and only then actually getting started. In future Dized will turn into a treasure chest of digital content for board games. Jussila, who has played both board and video games from an early age, knows exactly what it feels like to know a game inside out and know the questions of   by heart. “Digital content can bring additional elements to the game, such as new questions to a quiz-based game like  , soundtracks for games, or extra players with artificial intelligence.” Jussila points out that Playmore Games is not about creating an online game service; instead focus is strictly on the time people spend together playing board games. The idea is to expand the dimensions of the familiar style of playing. “Smart devices are an incredible source that is still overlooked when it comes to board games.” Playmore Games was founded in the spring of 2014. Jussila remembers telling Vainikka how he had been thinking about developing his own board game. At that point Vainikka announced that he had been planning a game for months already, and the two friends decided to join forces. Vainikka and Jussila have a background in IT, but both have made careers in other fields. “People who play video games mainly stare at the screen, whereas a board game is in the middle and people surround it sitting face to face,” says Jouni Jussila, CEO of Playmore Games. “Board games are about spending time together, and that is a part of being human.” The first board game published by Playmore Games,  , will soon see its second edition of over 10 000 copies.   will be the first game the Dized application will be able to teach. In addition to Vainikka and Jussila, Playmore Games currently has three other full-time employees, who focus their efforts on Dized. There are over a dozen shareholders, and the prototype will be coded by one of the shareholder companies. Jussila describes the story of the company as a series of events where chance and “silly yet courageous jumps into situations” play the biggest role. For example, most of the investors were found through a chain reaction: they found one, who knew another one, and so on and so forth. “We have been throwing hooks into the water and figured there is not much to lose. Tomi and I have formed a habit: if either of us starts a sentence by asking if we should do something, we just go do it every time.” Playmore Games’ goal is to turn Dized into a standard tool in the board game industry. Within the field there is a lot of interest; this has been evident when the company visited expos around the world. Later this year the company will organise a crowdfunding campaign, which will test the consumer market and not only work as a way to find funding, but also to form a community around the product. According to Jussila, the biggest board game markets are in North America and Europe, where particularly in Germany board games are a big part of the culture. “If you glance at a German book shelf, it is almost a miracle if you cannot spot a board game. The games are also in active use; they are not just collecting dust.” South America and China are emerging markets. China is also important for board games because that is where a lot of production takes place due to its low manufacturing and postage costs. The world will not be conquered with a five-person team. Jussila believes that if everything goes as expected, Dized will be published in 2017 and the team will have 10 to 15 members. The recruitment of additional programmers will begin as soon as the prototype is out. Despite the focus being on Dized, Playmore Games has not forgotten where it all started: games themselves. “We are game designers after all, and we have a shelf full of prototypes. However, right now our mind is set on Dized.” The first board game published by Playmore Games, Race to the North Pole, will be the first game the Dized application will be able to teach."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-games-scene-work-play/,Finland’s games scene – all work and all play,"With a mere 2 700 employees, last year Finland’s games industry generated a turnover of almost 2.5 billion euros. So, what gives? Finland has always punched above its weight on the world stage. Whether it’s having world-renowned education, the globe’s densest forests or even the most heavy metal bands per capita, there is no shortage of international indexes that feature Finland at the top these days. However, when it comes to its games scene, Finland really comes into its own. Spearheaded by the successes of  ’s   and  ’s   and  , it has the fastest growing games industry in the world. The compound annual growth rate of the industry has been over 40 per cent year-on-year between 2004–2015, even ballooning to 260 per cent from 2012–2013. A rising tide lifts all boats, or so the saying goes. In the wake of the pioneering duo, the influx of interest around the local industry has spawned a wave of  including   and  , as foreign investors clambered onboard. In fact, some 1.3 billion euros in international funds was pumped into the industry through investments and acquisitions between 2013 and 2015 – a figure not included in the industry’s most recent annual turnover of 2.4 billion euros. “The Americans are really surprised at how much we share between different companies,” says Teemu Huuhtanen, CEO of Next Games. “But it helps a lot in so many different ways.” However, contrary to these recent dazzling numbers, the industry is far from being an overnight success. In fact, Finland’s deep roots in games development stretch back over 30 years. Add to this a pinch of tech saviness, along with support from the government’s innovation fund  , and this recipe for success starts to take shape. The final ingredient is perhaps its most unexpected: transparency. “We share information, knowledge and networks,” states  , director of local games hub  . “Since we don’t have a domestic market and all our companies get more revenue from export markets abroad, it makes sense for Finnish game developers to cooperate inside Finland.” To some outsiders, this openness and exchange can certainly seem unusual. “The Americans are really surprised at how much we share between different companies,” explains  , CEO of Next Games. “But it helps a lot in so many different ways. It’s smart for the investors as well. The more that these companies share, the more likely it is that they are not all going to make the same mistake.” Given his company’s success with mobile game rather than close ranks, Huuhtanen remains an active member of the local scene. An advisor on the boards of various games companies, he also attends monthly community meetups where open dialogue is encouraged between companies both big and small. With all this in mind, one could be forgiven for thinking that there is no room for improvement for the local scene. Yet, when asked what advice they would give to young upstarts, both Hiltunen and Huuhtanen emphasise the same thing: differentiation and having an overall strategy. With 600 new games arriving everyday, relying solely on being featured on the App Store is not enough. A unique angle is needed to break into the world’s most competitive industry. Also, in light of the recent   of  , creating opportunities for branching out across other industries is of growing importance. Having sound business acumen and a good marketing strategy from the get-go is proving to be more valuable than ever. So too, then, is the need for education and training in the industry. “Usually it’s graphic designers or programmers launching the company, so the business side might be missing,” explains  , business area director at Aalto University  Aalto EE). “The game doesn’t succeed if you don’t have that business part in there.” Currently, more than 20 educational institutions in Finland offer gaming-focused programmes. Aalto EE’s   is currently the only one of these with a business skills and leadership focus. And it’s not just local students that wish to learn a holistic approach to the industry. To meet growing international interest, Aalto EE recently restructured its programme and launched it under the Aalto ENT brand. “Apart from Finns, we have students applying from Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Guatemala, Japan and Russia,” explains programme manager  . “We are not only helping big companies, but also startups in the industry. Part of the programme is to meet people and build strong connections.” These networks also fuel a better collaborative environment within each individual game company – something that Next Games’ Huuhtanen emphasises as a key to success. “There’s a lot of talent in Helsinki, more and more as we go,” he observes. “People are moving here from other countries, getting educated and joining the gaming industry. There will be great success stories in Finland in future, for sure.” Neogames’ mission is to accelerate, coordinate, and support the development of the Finnish game cluster.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wood-bends-in-the-hands-of-finns/,Wood bends in the hands of Finns,"Wood has been used in construction and for everyday objects for centuries. The trend will continue in the future due to the increasing focus on the bioeconomy and eco-friendliness. Finland is among the forerunners in the diverse use of wood. We present some of the most innovative examples of how wood bends in the hands of Finns. The world’s population is growing and people are moving to the cities. More apartments need to be built and old apartments need to be renovated and expanded. People are furnishing their homes and needing everyday objects. Public buildings are being constructed. In Europe, construction consumes more raw materials than any another branch of industry. The used materials are mostly non-renewable cement and steel whose manufacture results in considerable climate and environmental problems. The residents in Finland’s largest wooden high-rise building block in Helsinki have been extremely happy with the buildings’ sound insulation, among others. Wood is a renewable and ecological option. When it grows, a tree uses the carbon dioxide in the air, which it then stores. A wooden house also acts as a carbon sink. At the end of their lifecycle, wood products can be recycled or turned into energy. Despite this, wood is used relatively little globally. The material could, undoubtedly, be used more. Finnish and European forests are also managed in a sustainable way. “It takes 29 seconds for a Finnish forest to grow enough wood for a wooden high-rise building,” says  , managing director of Puuinfo, an organisation promoting the use of wood in construction. Viikki’s suburb in Helsinki features one of Finland’s largest new wooden high-rise building areas. The buildings, built according to a method developed by the Finnish company  , are quiet and spacious. Based on Finnish studies, people living in wooden apartment buildings are more satisfied than average with their apartments’ sound insulation, indoor temperature and living costs. Wooden structures also improve indoor air quality. Studies show that wooden elements indoors reduce stress levels, among other things. Viljakainen says that wooden surfaces have even been noticed to enhance the recovery of hospital patients. The Liina transitional shelter, developed by the Wood Program students at Aalto University, is being tested in a wind tunnel to see how it will stand up to weather conditions in disaster areas. Wood, a light-weight and easily adaptable material, can be used cleverly in disaster areas. People who have lost their homes could be offered the  , developed by the Wood Program students at Aalto University’s Department of Architecture, that does not require any tools to set up. “There is often nothing left in earthquake areas,” says the head of the Wood Program  . “The Liina shelter can be assembled using nylon straps in just a few hours.” The ecological house is designed to withstand extreme conditions: according to Heikkinen, it will stay standing in storm winds and during quakes. Two house packages can fit in a container and be easily shipped to disaster areas. , who graduated from Aalto University as a furniture designer last year, has studied the use of raw wood in furniture and everyday objects. “Wood is fun to study. What happens to it and what you can do with it using as little processing as possible,” Hihnala says. “Wood can be processed and bent using only water: wetting, drying and steaming.” Wood that has been processed less is also more ecological. “When the object’s time has come, it can be turned into firewood or used to heat a sauna, for example,” the designer says. “Energy isn’t wasted in processing it.” Studying furniture design in Finland involves a lot of hands-on working methods in workshops. The students work on their models using methods that are not limited to just computer programmes. Hihnala creates her designs directly from raw wood. For her diploma work looking into the use of raw wood, she dragged a trailer-full of branches to the school’s workshop: “From them I then started to outline all kinds of crooked wooden objects.” Finnish furniture designer Sanelma Hihnala studies how wood can be used in everyday objects with as little processing as possible and designs her work directly from raw wood. Many young Finnish designers use wood: “In Finland we have a lot of wood and no shortage of places to process it,” says Hihnala. “Before industrial processing, people made their own furniture because they could find wood in their backyards.” The designer cannot think of any limits to using wood. “Maybe bathtubs. Although the old fashioned bathing tubs are made of wood.” Next, Hihnala plans to go to Padasjoki in Central Finland to fetch a pier log that has been underwater for 30 years. She doesn’t know yet what it will turn into. “But it will certainly have a very beautiful patina.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-fashion-fought-way-stars/,Finnish fashion fought its way to the stars,"Why does the international fashion world recognise more and more Finnish names? According to some in the field it is not about Finland previously lacking in good designers – of course there were plenty. The world did not find Finnish designers, but Finnish designers found the world. Many fashion world VIPs wear clothes designed by Hyères Fashion Festival 2013 winner Satu Maaranen. Hyères Fashion Festival gave a big push in fashion designer  ’s career. Now, three years after winning the renowned French festival with her collection for her degree at Aalto University in 2013, her designs have been seen in international fashion brands such as Petit Bateau and on fashion world VIPs. For a recent graduate Hyères was a huge step forward and Maaranen sees many of her achievements, such as the collaborations with French and Chinese fashion brands, as a result of the festival. “The award came with plenty of media attention and a big network of international contacts,” Maaranen ponders. “Sure, things could have gone forward without Hyères, but I think it would have been a lot slower and more difficult.” Maaranen is co-founder and creative director at Pre Helsinki, which helps Finnish fashion go international through support like marketing and export projects. In her opinion, the recent successes are based on the ability to hit the global markets on a different level. She gives special credit to Aalto University’s  , a professor in fashion design, and  , lecturer in the same field, for how they encourage and even push students abroad. She also deems the university’s facilities exceptional. Whilst doing her internships abroad Maaranen came to notice how Finnish students knew everything from computer programmes to planning and running a shop. “I wonder if there are facilities anywhere that could compare to Aalto’s design studios.” , this year’s Hyères attendee, sees the internationalisation of Finnish fashion as a fruit of the joint effort of the university, Hirvonen, and Laitinen. “You do not see other Finnish institutions win international awards,” Ekroth says. “Aalto’s teachers are the ones that make students give their best.” Ekroth describes the style of teaching professional and ”superinspiring”. For him Hyères was a chance to showcase the skills he had gathered after touching a sewing machine for the first time when he was 29 years old. The festival was a turning point in his career. The plan to do a Master’s degree at a university in London was buried under other ideas and opportunities. “I met all the most important headhunters, and now I have business cards for plenty of big companies in my pocket,” Ekroth says. “It is a humbling experience to have people from big fashion houses walk up to you and tell you they are your fans and love your collection.” Students of Finnish Aalto University praise Pirjo Hirvonen, the professor in fashion design. Hirvonen, the teacher praised by both Maaranen and Ekroth, is the one who encouraged Aalto students to send their work to Hyères in 2012. Maaranen’s prize gave a boost of energy to the whole student community. “Making it to the final and winning made people understand that despite the high level of the competition, it is worth a shot,” Hirvonen says. She admits that the success did not come easily. A lot of work has been done, but finally the ingredients are all there. Networking and developing education further into an international direction have taken a decade. “Finland has always had talented designers, but times have taken an international turn,” Hirvonen continues. “Previously there maybe was not enough motivation to keep pushing forward, but now there are no other options. Current generations are more willing and faster to fully embrace opportunities than their predecessors.” Hirvonen points out that existing talent should be used to benefit the Finnish society and its competitiveness in general. She deems the pace too slow. “Success always takes courage and risk-taking, but this is especially the case in fashion design as it is a very competitive field. Now we should start taking our very best out to the world to see and get other parties involved, too.” In addition to state support, Hirvonen thinks companies should have a crystal clear focus. The world cannot be taken over without something disruptive or surprising. Maaranen would love to see a flagship store of Finnish design in Helsinki, a city which a lot of Asians pass through due to flight connections. If brands can get out for people to see, the word will start spreading. What is also needed is, of course, money. “To make this success last and reach new levels, fashion needs continuous support from the state,” Maaranen says. Ekroth mentions that Finland is a difficult country to start from, as there simply is not enough money in the domestic market. He says that as building a business in fashion is a long-term project where patience is essential. Satu Maaranen’s designs to Hyères fashion festival in 2014."

According to the City of San Jose website, its residents “enjoy 300 days of sunshine each year and an average annual temperature of 70 degrees (21 degrees Celsius)”. Located some 80 kilometres south of San Francisco, this sun-drenched city is known primarily for one thing: being the main hub of Silicon Valley. Yet, for all of its fine weather and healthy Californian living, there is one thing that this neck of the woods has in short supply. “There are more than 15 000 open software development positions right now in Silicon Valley alone,” explains  , CMO of  . “These stretch across major corporations, midsize firms and startups. They are really suffering from trying to find the right talent. It has an impact on their product development and business success.” Meanwhile, over in Northern Europe, along with an abundance of trees and lakes, there is another commodity that Finland is in no danger of running low on in the near future: software engineers. “Last year Microsoft laid off more than 2 000 people in Finland,” Sipilä explains. “Out of these were about 400 software developers. Most of them were doing full-scale product development; they really know how to write software.” Swiftly connecting the dots, Crewstaffer focuses on outsourcing this talent to Silicon Valley. Currently, the company has over 100 members on its books, which together form a collective of experienced software development teams. Well established Silicon Valley companies looking for staff know the importance of quality candidates. We are offering them much more advanced developers than they would get otherwise. These are the best teams from Nokia and Microsoft. “Well established Silicon Valley companies looking for staff know the importance of quality candidates,” Sipilä explains. “We are offering them much more advanced developers than they would get otherwise. These are the best teams from Nokia and Microsoft.” Crewstaffer targets the numerous startups, corporations and companies that are ramping up product development in the segments of embedded, medical products, wearables, IoT, wireless, protocols, cloud, localisation and testing. But, all things considered, how does the company know which piece fits perfectly where? Well, its founding quartet draws on over 15 years’ experience in software subcontracting, software sourcing, startup product software development and business development. Meanwhile, CTO   has worked in Silicon Valley for 15 years and Sipilä recently celebrated his 14th anniversary of living and working there. The concept itself is also tried and tested, modelled on founding partner  ’s enterprise Saraware, which has specialised in outsourcing and software subcontracting for dozens of major European corporations over the past 15 years. Whilst most of Crewstaffer’s energy is channelled towards outsourcing Finnish expertise, the company’s original business idea of lowering the barrier for US companies to establish a site in Finland is still in play. Crewstaffer can arrange for Finnish teams to be trained Stateside, and then bring that knowledge back to Finland to set up shop. “According to the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report, Finland is number one in availability of scientists and engineers in the world, and in the availability of the latest technologies and IPF protection,” explains Crewstaffer’s COO  . “Plus the cost level is roughly 40 per cent below the US average. There are a lot of benefits to setting up in Finland.” Nonetheless, outsourcing remains Crewstaffer’s primary focus, with the company also expanding operations to other areas of the USA and Brazil. “Setting up the product development team is the fundamental thing that determines your success,” Sipilä emphasises. “Finns are stable and dedicated workers. This is demand meeting supply.” In Northern Europe, along with an abundance of trees and lakes, there is another commodity that Finland is in no danger of running low on in the near future: software engineers."

Too busy. Too tired. Too expensive. These days it’s all too easy to come up with an excuse not to find time to enjoy one’s hobbies. Here in Finland it would appear as if the locals have an even bigger obstacle to overcome than most, in the shape of the Arctic winter. But, in a surprising twist, weather conditions actually rarely deter Finns from getting out and about year-round. This even extends to local fishing enthusiasts, who aren’t put off by the annual coating of ice that forms between them and their prey. Armed with warm clothes, a seat and – most importantly – a drill, once a hole has been bored, one needs only drop their line to tempt the smorgasbord swimming below. So, if this sounds like the perfect way to spend your free time, what can you do if your local climate doesn’t facilitate perching atop of a frozen surface? “Fishing games are pretty popular everywhere, basically, on all platforms,” explains  , CEO of Tampere-based games developer  . “But there haven’t really been many ice fishing games around.” Until now, that is. The company’s   gives gamers the choice of dozens of locations to try their luck in. Upon settling on a suitable spot, it’s time to drill down, with the game switching to first-person mode. “You can select from almost 100 pieces of equipment, and take into account depths, weather conditions and time of day,” Liljedahl explains. “One important factor is also how you move the rod. It’s a complex system how each fish can be caught, as each species reacts differently.” Although at first glance   may seem to be something of a niche title, the game has managed to attract some widespread interest. In Ice Lakes players can select from almost 100 pieces of equipment, and take into account depths, weather conditions and time of day. “There have been lots of players from more exotic locations, like Japan, China, Spain and Brazil,” Liljedahl says. “We didn’t expect it would be so successful. It’s fun to see that some players know how to do ice fishing, even though there is no ice or snow in wintertime in their area.” This knowhow now looks like expanding even further, with Iceflake Studios recently launching a new North American-centred update. “We are adding fishing cabins where you can go inside and fish in warm conditions,” Liljedahl outlines. “There are also more fish species familiar to the US and Canada and new maps concentrated on that side of the globe.” The updates aren’t set to end there, with Liljedahl hinting that possibilities for summer ice fishing may also arrive in future. ’ recent popularity doesn’t mean that Iceflake Studios itself is an overnight success – far from it. In fact, the studio has created a total of 15 titles since 2007. Reaching over 25 million players worldwide already with mobile games such as   and  ,   is the studio’s first PC release. This doesn’t mean that the six-man team has now shifted focus solely to PC from now on, however. “Our first console title will be released in the near future,” Liljedahl says. “  is also coming on mobile, and you will be able to play a multiplayer game on mobile against PCs. [Snooker game]   was first released on Steam, and it’s actually now also on mobile; iOS and Android users can play against other devices.” Removing such restrictions between players is part of the company’s cross platform plan for each release. “This is something that not many companies are doing at moment,” Liljedahl outlines. “We are at the forefront of technology in the game business.” Ice Lakes is coming on mobile, and soon players will be able to play a multiplayer game on mobile against PCs."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/polkka-jam-prints-finnish-everyday-life-on-recycled-materials/,Polkka Jam prints Finnish everyday life on recycled materials,"Polkka Jam, a Finnish design agency, prints images inspired by Nordic nature and the everyday life of Finns on recycled materials, to the delight of people in both Finland and abroad. Unique images are what make a brand stand out. That is the credo of   and  , the founders of  , an agency specialising in the ecological manufacture of prints and in illustration design. Their illustrations have already found their way onto the products of a number of Finnish and foreign co-operation partners. Polkka Jam favours uses recycled materials in its paper products and prints its textiles using non-toxic water-based colours. Pictured is co-founder Kristiina Haapalainen. It was the year 1999. Textile design student Haapalainen and graphic design student Vähä-Aho met and started dating. The couple shared the desire to do creative work, and both felt that illustrating would be a natural way for them to express themselves. The young designer couple set out to follow their dream by printing gig posters for underground bands using silk screen printing. After designing their first prints together they established their own brand. In 2002, they created their first jointly designed pattern,  . Over the years, the offerings have varied: in addition to its flagship paper products, the company has manufactured, for example, quilted jackets, duvet covers and jigsaw puzzles. The couple design their prints themselves and give preference to local producers in everything they do. The company manufactures its ecological products from 100 per cent recycled paper in Finland so that it can tell its customers their origin. For Polkka Jam, it is all about the images – that is where the whole product design process starts. The illustrations are inspired by old Eastern European animations and poster art, Nordic graphic design and American applied graphic art from the 1950s. “Our illustrations feature coffee cups, gramophones, cats, books, kites, cherry trees and garden parties,” Haapalainen and Vähä-aho list. Inspiration can be found anywhere. “We constantly explore our environment and are often inspired by small everyday things and insights,” the designers say. Finnish concepts and objects are the themes that find their way into the illustrations of the couple who live on Kimito island. Nordic nature and the variations of the seasons have also left their mark on their designs. In addition to its own collection, Polkka Jam also designs illustrations for several Finnish and foreign companies. Polkka Jam has, for example, designed illustrations for the gift cards of the American retail giant Target. In addition, the Finnish design company’s products are sold in boutiques across Europe and they have distributors in Japan and South Korea. Alongside Europe, the company’s main market areas are the US and Japan. According to the company’s founders, distribution and co-operation agreements are often initiated at the foreign customers’ suggestion, and the agreements give rise to new work opportunities. The company’s objective going forward is to increase co-operation with international customers. And of course: “To do as many illustrations as possible.” Polkka Jam’s offering includes ecologically manufactured paper products from postcards to posters and notepads."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/classroom-boardroom-young-game-developers-impress-shadow-bug/,From classroom to boardroom: Young game developers impress with Shadow Bug,"Most students hope their work impresses their teachers. Three students at Aalto University impressed Apple Corporation. “Apple featured us on the App Store’s Best New Games section,” says  . “That was awesome.” The artist Ylimäki is one-third of a team of students who built a mobile game as their Master’s thesis. The others are programmer   and sound man  . The result is  , an action platformer where the player controls a ninja bug protecting his forest from monsters produced by an evil factory. The game is praised for its scenery of dark and mysterious silhouettes as well as its beautiful, oriental-style music. But what has attracted the most attention is how the game is played. “Shadow Bug has unique game-playing mechanics,” Ylimäki explains. “It is a platform game without a jump button. It’s perfect for mobile screens.” It can be played with just a single finger. You touch the left or right part of the screen to make the ninja bug walk in that direction. A tap on an enemy makes the bug leap and attack. This jump-attack is the way to cross barriers or get to new platforms. “Shadow Bug has unique game-playing mechanics,” Muro Studios’ Juha Ylimäki explains. “It is a platform game without a jump button. It’s perfect for mobile screens.” While most of their time has been taken up by work on Shadow Bug, they did make a brief detour to complete another game, Bro Fist Simulator. “How to explain Bro Fist Simulator?” Ylimäki laughs. “The idea came from somewhere.” Bro Fist Simulator is exactly what it sounds like: a simulation of two arms making hand signs and fist-bumping. If you don’t close your fist before the bump, you lose your fingers. It’s goofy, but humorous and compelling. The game even attracted the attention of Youtuber  , who has over 45 million subscribers. “It was great fun,” Ylimäki says. “We just wanted a funny game and only had 48 hours to complete it during the Global Game Jam event. The PC version got a lot of attention on the gaming platform Steam so we also released it on Apple’s iOS.” The trio began working on Shadow Bug in November 2014 and founded their company Muro Studios in April 2015. One of the monsters in the game is also called “Muro.” “In Finnish  means ‘cereal’,” Ylimäki explains. “We were joking that the monster had a face which looked like a piece of cereal.” Muro Studios has yet to approach venture capitalists. Their main funding so far has been through the Finnish Promotion Centre for Audiovisual Culture, known as Avek. But if Shadow Bug continues to gain attention VCs will soon be eager to talk to these talented students. “People tend to like the game. It is critically acclaimed and has been featured at many events,” Ylimäki concludes. “Shadow Bug is easy to get into but has a steep difficulty curve. We have some new levels coming with the next update that are ridiculously hard.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/startups-honed-perfection-finnish-schools/,Startups honed to perfection at Finnish schools,"The only education sector business accelerator in the Nordic countries, Xedu, combines the best of Finnish expertise, first-class education and the startup field’s inventive technology know-how. Xedu, an education sector accelerator based in Finland’s capital Helsinki has only been up and running for a little over six months but it is already on its way out into the world:  , one of Silicon Valley’s biggest business accelerators. The agreement will enable the accelerator giant’s startups to make use of Xedu’s services and vice versa. In addition to the Silicon Valley co-operation deals, the Finnish business accelerator has introduced to the world Mightifier that improves the self-esteem of school children and the Seppo tool that encourages students to set foot outdoors. The Mightifier app will be tested in US schools while Seppo has already a large body of users in the Middle East. According to the CEO of Xedu,  , and its programme director  , the internationalisation of education technology companies has been impeded by the lack of necessary references as the companies have found it difficult to gain access to schools in order to develop their products. Furthermore, newcomers have found it hard to gain entry to the school sector’s procurement process. xEdu is meeting this challenge with its model that brings schools and startups together. The accelerator is located alongside the University of Helsinki and its premises include training and workshop facilities, as well as designated workrooms for the startups selected for the semester-long accelerator programme. The co-owner of Lentävä Liitutaulu, Tero Kulha, believes that the company will experience considerable growth in the near future. According to Lindholm, the training focuses on a pedagogical approach, the development of business and on technology. “Their fusion is important,” he says. “We bring in top expertise from both the University of Helsinki and Aalto University, which is then handed over to these startups to use.” After the training, the companies’ products are tested in Finnish schools. “The products are really put through the wringer in Finnish schools,” says Lindholm. “Because Finnish teachers are pedagogically the best in the world, they are also the most critical.” According to Korhonen, Xedu has also brought sparring culture, an important element borrowed from the world of game companies, to the education sector. “In this training programme, after the lectures and workshops, we focus on mutual sparring,” he says. “It is part of the added value that we provide.” One of Xedu’s promising products is Seppo, developed by Lentävä Liitutaulu, a Finnish startup established in 2012. Seppo is a gamification platform that allows teachers to create games for students. The basis is often a map and the students play the game in teams using their mobile devices while moving around outdoors. “We think it’s kind of silly that schools purchase a whole bunch of mobile devices yet the students just sit with them in classrooms,” says the company’s co-owner  . The platform is used by around 300 schools in Finland. The company is heading abroad, first to the Netherlands and the Arab Emirates and Qatar, where they already have a foot in the door. The company has also gamified a fair in Dubai and the first agreements in the Arab Emirates were signed this year. The country also has several schools piloting the Finnish platform. And if that wasn’t enough already, the company is involved in promising negotiations for the gamification of the 2020 Dubai World Expo as well as featuring at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2018. According to Kulha, the company is operating on a rising market as learning environments and their diversification are currently a much-discussed topic. “We believe that a large portion of teaching will move outside the classroom,” he continues. In Kulha’s view, Seppo platform stands out from the competition particularly due to pedagogical insight. “We don’t want people to stare at their mobile devices in order to figure out where they are; they need to be able to observe their environment and learn from it.” Xedu’s goal is to make Finland an education technology hub which creates technology products that provide genuine benefits in teaching. A second rising talent in Xedu’s startup pool is Mightifier. Its CEO   and  , in charge of digital development, started to develop a mobile application of the same name in summer 2015. The application helps children to identify their classmates’ strengths and to give feedback on them. The company has piloted the service in around a dozen schools in southern Finland and, in September 2016, a trial will also be initiated in schools in Chicago. Talks are also ongoing in Southeast Asia and Europe. “Children learn to identify the strengths of their classmates’ characters based on behaviour,” says Pänkäläinen. “Things that happen during recess, in the lunch line or group work, good things where the classmate displays tenacity, courage or friendliness, for example.” The teacher sends the children a request for feedback in-app and allots a fellow pupil for each student to comment on, a target for the feedback. They can comment on a classmate’s character traits such as carefulness and courage. The answers are sent to the teacher who reviews the comments before publishing the feedback on the profile of the feedback recipient. “It is such a great moment for the child when he or she can go see who sent feedback this time,” says Pänkäläinen. According to her, the provider of the feedback is also excited when a comment is published – they see their friend’s face light up. The feedback is saved on the children’s strength profiles. The application also helps teachers tell parents about their child’s strengths and to improve the classroom atmosphere. At the app’s development stage, children’s greatest concern was whether the app could be used to tease others. This type of problem has barely occurred at all – the feedback is visible to one child and the teacher, not to a large group, which is usually what motivates bullies. The personal strength profiles have also helped children to recognise their own strengths and to talk about them. An improvement in feedback skills and the reduction of teasing can be measured, and the founding duo believes that the phenomena will reflect on future study results. “If a third grader can use it without training then we are pretty close to success,” Timonen describes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/open-data-creates-life-simplifying-apps/,Open data creates life-simplifying apps,"Cities are constantly gathering and producing immense amounts of information. What if all that data were up for grabs for anyone to use? service has opened the capital region’s data for everyone, and gives rise to apps and services that make everyday life easier. Once upon a time there was a king, who ordered his subjects to gather all possible information about his kingdom: what was the weather like at 5:30 am, how often did people travel between villages, and how long did the journey take. He also wanted to know what diseases existed in different parts of the village, and which grains were farmed on each strip of land. Open data helps urban city dwellers to create neat apps to ease everyday life. “What will the king do with all this information?” his subjects wondered. The truth was: nothing. He stored all the information in a large vault in his castle. The end. Fortunately, in today’s world, fact is more magical than fiction. Finland’s capital region cities Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen collect all the possible information, but unlike the king of the story, they make the most out of this of this data and have it openly accessible to anyone. A recipient of multiple international awards, the Helsinki Region Infoshare service (HRI) contains over 1 200 open statistics and datasets. New data keeps pouring to the service constantly as cities collect and produce information all the time. Among other things, the service contains all the concerts of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra since 1882, the investments of the city of Vantaa and the food establishments in Helsinki. Anyone can access and download the data from the HRI website and use it to their liking. Only five years ago the cities functioned like the king; gathering all the data only for himself. They collected huge amounts of information on the city and its citizens, which was utilised only by civil servants in decision making and designing services. If statistics indicated that a service – say a branch library – is used more than expected, it is easier to oppose its termination. The cities utilise the data they collect to create services for their citizens, but sometimes someone else can do it better – and faster. Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen started opening their data in 2011 and it has led to creating several services and apps. For example, after a stormy winter night, you are able to follow the real-time movement of snowploughs on your phone, you can also check whether your train is on time as well as   in front of the Helsinki railway station. The HRI service, which has hundreds of statistics, resembles a big box full of Legos. So, no wonder that the city of Vantaa built a model of their city in the Minecraft game using the city’s elevation model, different geographic information datasets, and the National Land Survey’s Topographic database. Creating neat apps to ease the life of urban city dwellers is not the only aim behind open data access. It also makes decision making transparent and thus improves democracy. “Making lots of our city purchase data public opened up a new view for citizens into city administration, and it increases people’s trust toward the city and its officials,” says project manager of Helsinki City Urban Facts  . The city has also estimated that opening up the data has resulted in 1–2 per cent savings, because projects are now undertaken with more background knowledge. But what if someone abuses open data? The fear that officials might be feeling is understandable, since they cannot know beforehand how the information is going to be used. However, not a single case of misuse has been reported. Being this open means a big shift in attitudes in the cities’ administration, but for those officials having mixed feelings about openness Lahti has an answer: “The information belongs to the citizens.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/shark-punch-creates-a-matchmaker-for-gamers/,Shark Punch creates a matchmaker for gamers,"Finnish startup Shark Punch wants to disrupt the game industry by creating the “Netflix for games”. Investors agree that such service is in demand: the company raised over a million euros in a funding round led by London Venture Partners. Due to the investment, the number of Shark Punch staff will nearly double.  With technology and free online tools just about anyone can be a game developer. More and more people use smartphones and the potential target audience keeps growing, but it’s difficult to spot new favourites from the ever-expanding selection of games. CEO   says   wanted to bring games and gamers together. ”Something had to be done, but no one else seemed to do it. We decided it’s time to fix things.” A platform called Playfield is meant to guide its users to games of their interest according to their previous preferences and the games played by their peers. A similar principle is used by music streaming service Spotify and internet television network Netflix, when they suggest new music and movies to their customers. ”Our dream is that in a few years a player looking for new games will automatically turn to Playfield. At the same time we want to help gamers create communities and a type of hype around new games,” Kupiainen describes. The four owners of Shark Punch have years of experience in the industry. Their first company, Rocket Pack, was sold to Disney in 2011, and they all started working for Disney Interactive. Kupiainen was the first one to leave; the rest followed later. A platform called Playfield is meant to guide its users to games of their interest according to their previous preferences and the games played by their peers. The old gang started to ponder over new projects as a hobby. They started creating The Masterplan, a bank robbery game set in the 70s. ”We were reminiscing about the classic games of the ’90s. They had a lot of great features, but in practice they weren’t that great. We wanted to maintain their spirit, but improve their playability,” Kupiainen explains. Soon they noticed how hard it was to create a community of gamers around the game. It turned out that other game developers were struggling with the same issue. Now the test version of Playfield is available for everyone. London Venture Partners’ investment ensures that the product can be properly prepared. Shark Punch has also discussed additional funding with Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes. The money will bring the seven-person team five new employees. ”Without money we would have to think of making Playfield profitable. Now we can focus on creating the best possible product before coming up with ways of making money.” The early access version of The Masterplan is also available for gamers. The version for PC is being improved according to the wishes of the players, and it will be published later this spring. Later it will be available for mobile devices. Kupiainen deems the game-developing expertise in Finland ”shockingly good”. Internationally successful Rovio and Supercell aren’t the only companies that have worked long and hard. ”Being Finnish can open some doors with, say, investors. If we were from elsewhere, we might not make it to the meeting room. Finland is like a quality stamp for the product,” says Jiri Kupiainen. ”Often when I see a game demo by a Finnish company I can’t help but that think wow, how did a small group of people manage to get it this good? Technical skills are top-notch. Maybe it’s got something to do with the long winters; people don’t mind sitting indoors coding.” According to Kupiainen, the team spirit amongst Finnish game developers is good. He thinks the companies aren’t competing against each other, but rather against the rest of the world. ”Being Finnish can open some doors with, say, investors. If we were from elsewhere, we might not make it to the meeting room. Finland is like a quality stamp for the product.” Kupiainen himself spends half of the year in San Francisco. He considers the game markets in the US the most developed in the world, but Asia is catching up rapidly. ”The game industry is getting bigger and bigger. I don’t believe in a bubble; games have just become a part of mainstream entertainment.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-health-bracelet-may-revolutionise-hospital-patient-care/,Finnish health bracelet may revolutionise hospital patient care,"Finnish biomedical startup Medieta has an ambitious goal: to reduce healthcare costs while optimising patient care and increasing efficiency. The key to this is the company’s unique medical health measurement bracelet ‘ErrS’.  “The company was born in 2012 out of medical frustration,” explains the CEO and co-founder of    “Three ‘wise men’ [doctors] marched into my office. They were discouraged by the inefficiency of patient monitoring. Some surgery patients even passed away at night time because there wasn’t an efficient system for monitoring their biosignals.” To answer this challenge an idea was born for an easy-to-use, wireless medical measurement bracelet to enable remote patient monitoring. Two years later the prototype bracelet is in test use in two university hospitals in Finland, and Medieta is getting ready to launch the final product in late 2015. The ErrS bracelet is equipped with GPS and measures several different biosignals, like blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The measurement data is transferred in real-time to Medieta’s cloud-based platform where the assigned doctor or a nurse can check the measurement data. They also get alerted if any anomalies or significant changes are detected in the patient’s vitals. While the bracelet is still under development, the promising prototype has already raised international interest. The final product will be launched in late 2015. In addition to data gathering, the system analyses the collected data against Early Warning Score Tables, which are widely used in hospitals, and predicts the development of possible complications, such as cardiac arrest. The remote monitoring makes it possible to discharge hospital patients earlier and reduces unnecessary hospital visits. This not only improves the patients’ wellbeing but also brings substantial cost savings when fewer hospital days are needed and resources can be allocated more efficiently. Furthermore the data can be used to determine correct medication and treatment needs or in some cases even to see whether a patient has remembered to take their medication. “We can increase the efficiency of a hospital by up to 40 per cent. Patients can be safely transferred from intensive care or discharged earlier since there is a reliable way to remotely monitor their vitals,” says Ruoppa. “We are the first in the world to have integrated the measurement of all main biosignals into one user-friendly and truly mobile device. It also looks like a consumer product and not like hospital equipment.” While the bracelet is still under development, the promising prototype has already raised international interest. In the UK pilot tests are scheduled to start in the next few months and similar discussions are currently under way in the US. For now the US and the EU are the primary target markets for the company which employs around 30 people in its teams in Finland.  missed critical warning signs and unnecessary visits to the doctor add over 130 billion dollars in annual costs to the healthcare system. Medieta’s health bracelet alerts health care professional of anomalies in a patient’s vitals and predicts complications before they develop. It can be also used to determine correct medication and treatment needs. “In total we are looking at a huge market. That will keep us busy. We have received lots of enquiries from China as well, but that time will come later,” says Ruoppa. “I believe that in a few years time we will employ 200–300 people and have offices at least in the UK and the US, possibly also in Germany.” While the bracelet is packed with features also suitable for fitness tracking, Medieta’s plans do not include expanding to the consumer market. Instead, the company envisions different versions of the bracelet which could be prescribed by doctors not only to existing patients but also to people belonging to high risk groups. “Healthcare needs more automation and better abilities to intervene at an early stage. We want to start an evolution in healthcare similar to what happened in communication when we moved from landlines to mobile phones or from physical banks to internet banking,” says Ruoppa. “Like some wise Chinese have said, hospitals should be only for the sickest of the sick. We can help to make that happen.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/canatu-s-touch-paves-the-way-for-new-devices/,Canatu’s touch paves the way for new devices,"Finnish nanotech company Canatu is gearing up for a critical year. The company is hoping to commercialise its Carbon NanoBud technology, which can make just about any surface into a touch sensor.   CEO   says if mass volume orders take off, the workforce, currently numbering 27 worldwide, could expand to more than 100 in the next year or so. Touch screens are usually made by overlaying a display screen with a transparent sheet of indium tin oxide. This material can only be used on a flat surface because it is brittle. For some time, manufacturers have experimented with carbon nanotubes to create more flexible touchscreens but have faced the challenge of conductivity and expense. With its flexible, transparent film,   has solved both problems, paving the way for next-generation touch devices. “The novelty of CNB (carbon nanobud) is that it is flexible, bendable and stretchable,” says Vuohelainen. “We also offer a better optical performance. Thanks to low reflectivity and haze properties, our films have a better   compared to our competitors’ products. This means the use of lower backlight power, which in turn increases battery life.” The company says between 30 and 40 companies are currently working with its materials and that it is expecting mass volume orders in the first quarter. “When industry moves towards more bendable, flexible, displays then the solution needs to be very flexible and bendable like ours”, says Risto Vuohelainen, CEO of Canatu. It is currently targeting the display market as well as the rapidly expanding wearables market. The products can also be used in the automotive and white goods markets. “We have huge potential to grow to be the biggest supplier,” says Vuohelainen. “We are already in an advantageous market leader position. Our aim is to expand and keep innovating.” Canatu has already invested in equipment to make enough film to cover hundreds of thousands of smartphone touch screens every month. It is ramping up production this year so that it is in a position to supply materials for millions of touchscreens per month. Expansion of production facilities in Finland and Asia are on the cards. At the moment, the Helsinki-based company has offices in China, Japan and the US. Just over 10 years ago, Canatu was established as a spin-off from the Helsinki University of Technology. It’s now on the wave of a revolution. “When industry moves towards more bendable, flexible, displays then the solution needs to be very flexible and bendable like ours,” says Vuohelainen. Although he and his colleagues are raring to go, he accepts that his company is dependent on the flexible display manufacturers getting their displays on the markets in huge volumes. “It could be this year, next year or 2017 when we see big volumes on big brands with millions of units made,” Vuohelainen says. “The biggest challenge in an era of new technology is the mentality. Who will be the first to adopt the new technology?”"

Organisers say it can be replicated in many countries. When someone imagines a Finnish school they probably think of a building surrounded by snow and birch trees. Yet thanks to an innovative project between the Supreme Education Council of Qatar and   they may soon imagine the gleaming skyscrapers of Doha and the glittering waters of the Gulf. The   has taken the Finnish education system and exported it to Qatar. At the school boys and girls between the ages of five and seven are taught the Finnish curriculum by Finnish teachers in the English language. They finished up their first term late in December 2014. “Everything is going surprisingly well, especially if you think how fast we’ve had to build up everything. The whole team in Finland and Qatar is very happy with the program,” says  , CEO of the education export company EduCluster Finland. Holm explains that the pupil-centred approach of Finnish education can be applied to many places besides Finland. “We Finns know that we use many of the world’s best practices in our pedagogy and in our schools,” he says. “We have world class teacher and leadership training that we are able to promote. We think that the education model is a combination of various elements such as the learning environment, pedagogy, administration and surrounding community. We bring all of these aspects together.” The Qatar-Finland International School currently has about 100 students. Holm praises the skills of the 22 people working at the Qatar-Finland International School and explains that they are the reasons for its success. “The foundation of the system is top-qualified teachers and principals. Every single one has at least a Master’s degree. Also the pedagogical methodology is brilliant. Problem solving is one of the key issues in classroom pedagogy as well as the ideology that no one is left behind.” EduCluster Finland is part of the University of Jyväskylä group and has participated in over 30 education sector development projects around the world over the past decade. Holm says that they hope to spread the school model into more geographic areas. “It’s all about building a long-lasting partnership to co-create the answer to our client’s needs and work towards the big vision,” he continues. The school currently has about 100 students who began their next term on 4 January. Holm points out that those parents in Doha who are interested in the school but missed the start of the semester shouldn’t worry. “We’re still able to get pupils into the school during the semester,” he says."

It is a product and service limited only by your ingenuity. The Finnish company Haltian says the service can alert you when the mailman arrives, send car telemetry for amateur rally drivers or even track a balloon’s flight. This is  , a unique approach to the Internet of Things. “Thingsee One is the world’s first smart developer device,” says  , co-founder of Haltian and head of the Thingsee project. “The same device can be used for both development and testing the solution. The best thing is that companies might start their business with Thingsee One – with no investment in hardware R&D.” The Internet of Things is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable computing devices. Ylläsjärvi explains that it consists of three parts: the hardware device, the backend data and the frontend application. Thingsee provides all three, and it aims to be so simple that even novices can use it. “For the first time people with no prior experience can explore the Internet of Things with Thingsee and our mobile application. People with a very specific problem can use it with our mobile app without any technical experience,” Ylläsjärvi explains. Thingsee One can even alert you when the mailman arrives. The look of the hardware is reminiscent of an old smartphone, which makes sense as Haltian is staffed by former Nokia employees. The device communicates wirelessly and includes a GPS locator, gyroscope and magnetometer. Additionally it has a variety of sensors which detect light, pressure, temperature and humidity. “Thingsee can be used in unlimited ways. People interested in embedded software development can create great software on a high quality open-source developer platform. People planning to build an Internet of Things service or application can use Thingsee One as their hardware. The Industrial Internet is just one market segment where it can be used as a hardware platform for system integration and development.” The company began business analysis and concept development in May 2013 and the current device has been under development since the beginning of 2014. To help get the project going Haltian has embarked on a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. “The first beta devices will be shipped to Kickstarter backers in mid-January 2015 and commercial shipments are planned for early April 2015,” Ylläsjärvi continues. “At first we are selling through our own web store, but we are already in talks with retailers around the world.” The idea has already captured the attention of large American technology websites like Tech Crunch, and the Finns are pleased with the crowdfunding response so far. “During the first few days of the Kickstarter campaign we have had an overwhelming amount of interest globally and in less than three days we reached 50 per cent of our original target. It looks like others besides us think that Thingsee might be useful for a lot of innovations,” he concludes."

Finnish water brand Hile Water bottles spring water in Lapland on a production line located next to the spring, prints the labels, packs the bottles in boxes and ships them all over the world. But why? “We have all been working abroad in various international positions,” says   co-founder  . “We asked ourselves: what would be a good export product for Finland now that we are in a recession? Water, of course – because, according to UNESCO’s studies, Finland has the best water on Earth. That’s how it all started.” Hile Water was founded less than a year ago. It produces bottled spring and mineral water in glass and PET bottles. The spring water is captured directly from natural springs. It flows naturally through the ground layers without pumping, which means that the water’s natural molecular structure remains unaltered. The mineral water comes from an underground reservoir formed during the Ice Age and contains significant amounts of minerals. In addition, the company also sells Finnish bulk water for industrial use, among other applications. All products are exported, and marketing efforts are currently targeted primarily at Asia and Australia. All Hile Water’s products are exported, and marketing efforts are currently targeted primarily at Asia and Australia. At the moment, we are looking into new markets to find out whether there is demand for our product,” says  , who is responsible for the company’s logistics. “It appears that there is in most parts of the world. Our challenge is that we are quite far away from the thirsty people.” Logistics has indeed been a time-consuming challenge for the startup. Hile Water has had to figure out how to get spring water from Lapland to the other side of the globe, intact and without it freezing on the way with outside temperatures of -30 degrees Celsius. “It would certainly be easier to sell pieces of wood than a food product, but this has been a fantastic learning process in all respects,” Viitala says. The company has also been struggling with the criteria in place in different countries for the labels on the bottles and the boxes in which the bottles are packed. For example, the labels for the bottles destined to Australia were printed four times to meet the local directives. “It’s no wonder that many entrepreneurs have been discouraged by this complicated process, but we have a strong will. This team is our resource and we will not be discouraged,” says  , who is in charge of the company’s marketing and branding. Hile Water’s team consists of seven people who have known each other either since they were children or at least for the last ten years. “We all have experience working for international companies. We were born in four different decades, from the Stone Age until the 1990s,” quips Kivelä. Hile Water’s clean spring water comes from a natural spring in Lapland. Different perspectives on running a business and insight into many types of customers and cultures are seen as the strengths of the diverse team. Access to global markets is at the heart of Hile Water’s expertise. Hile Water sells water in glass bottles primarily to hotels and restaurants, while PET bottled water is more likely to end up on supermarket shelves. “Finland enjoys a positive image abroad, which is a great help in selling the product,” Timo Viitala says. “But even though Finland and Scandinavia are strongly branded as clean and pure, this does not apply to water concretely. This business requires major efforts especially in marketing, as the market is constantly growing and the competition is fierce.” Hile Water sees South America and South Africa as potential future markets for Finnish water. Emerging markets and their growing middle class are considered to pose a challenge, but it’s also important to be among the first to tap into these markets. This business has been like building ladders,” Kivelä sums up. “Sometimes they have come tumbling down, but we have always started to rebuild them.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-biobanks-one-step-ahead-of-others/,Finnish biobanks one step ahead of others,"Finland’s revised Biobank Act came into force in autumn 2013 and has been on everyone’s lips in international medical research circles ever since. The Act enables a broader use of the sample collections than in other European countries for medical research and protects the rights of the sample donor. Finland has taken a quantum leap ahead of its research partners in  . Last autumn, a new Biobank Act entered into force in Finland, making a dream come true for medical researchers: all of the human samples previously collected in Finland can be transferred to biobanks and utilised for research purposes. In a number of other countries it is not possible, for example, to transfer old diagnostic samples collected in hospitals to biobanks, because no specific consent has been requested from the sample donors. In Finland, the transfer of old sample collections into a biobank and their wide use in research have now been regulated by the Act. The sample donors can, if they wish so, refuse the transfer of their old samples into a biobank, but when collecting new samples, consent for transferring them to a biobank is always requested from the donor. ”In accordance with the new Act, the samples of 110 000 donors are being transferred from the  ’s (THL) population studies to THL’s biobank. Over the next few years, the aim is to transfer as much as more than 900 000 samples to the biobank,” says THL Biobank director  . “The health of the sample donors has been monitored for 20 years and the genetic studies have produced results not only on rare diseases, but also on the genetic forms of and predisposition to the most common diseases,” Jalanko says. “One of the best-known examples of utilising genetic information is lactose intolerance, the diagnosis of which is based on a genetic test that has now replaced the previously used lactose stress test,” Jalanko adds. A coherent biobank system is being established in Europe and Finland has been strongly involved in its creation. Diagnostic samples previously collected in Finland, combined with future samples and health data, will also form a significant material base for international research projects. Finland is one of the sixteen member states which, together with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), form the   network, one of the largest healthcare infrastructures in Europe. ”When it comes to the new Biobank Act, Finland is in a leading position. It is so well thought out! Finland has succeeded in resolving issues that many other countries are still struggling with,” says Professor , Director General of BBMRI-ERIC. In Jalanko’s view, Finland now has a unique opportunity to set an example: ”Europe’s goal is to create a similar coherent availability service and similar quality standards and assignment principles as we in Finland already are in a position to put in place. We can set an example of how the samples with the data attached to them can be assigned for research use without compromising privacy.” There are currently three registered biobanks collecting samples, all of which have received an operating licence in 2014. In the near future, five more biobanks are set to be opened. Dutch Professor Gert Jan B. van Ommen, one of the founders of BBMRI, specialises in developing diagnostics and treatment methods for both commonplace and rare diseases. ”Finland’s unique asset in developing biobank activity, along with the revised Act, is that there are few biobanks, as only reliable healthcare operators, such as hospital districts together with universities, and THL, are establishing them. Co-operation is easier and biobanks have access to substantial amounts of material,” Jalanko explains. Co-operation between biobanks and the healthcare sector creates prerequisites for taking into account the patient’s own genotype during his or her treatment. The focus of biobank activity is now on developing individual medication. That requires the integration of a number of large biobank material bases. As Professor Gert Jan B. van Ommen, Director at BBMRI-NL, points out, the number of disease occurrences must be sufficiently large to have any significance. ”Let us imagine a biobank that has access to the samples of 100 000–200 000 people, collected over 10 to 20 years, as is the case in Finland at present. Researchers could single out those who, over a certain timeframe, have developed a rare pancreatic cancer, for example, as well as those who could possibly develop one within a certain timeframe. In addition, there is a group of people who have not developed the disease even though they have the same risk factors as those affected by the disease. In practice, one person out of 1 000 represents this exception,” van Ommen explains. ”One such person is not of much help, but if there are a hundred of them, it will be possible in future to compare them to find out what in their biological make-up protects them against the disease. This would allow us to map out the factors that lead to the occurrence of the cancer, and to develop and personalise medication and prevent the development of the disease,” van Ommen sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wood-bends-in-tonfisk-s-design/,Wood bends in Tonfisk’s design,"A design company that wanted its name to reflect its Finnish origins and innovativeness was named after a Swedish can of tuna. In the beginning, the company thought the name was amusing but, over time, it also started sounding good. Today, the Finnish company is known as far away as Asia.  primarily manufactures coffee and tea sets and its product range is growing year by year. Today, half of Tonfisk’s products are exported and half are sold in Finland. The company sells its products in more than 30 countries and it sees potential for growth especially in Asia. “It all started in 1999. We were wondering what we should do next and decided to start our own brand. We only had a few products and we just started selling those,” says Tonfisk’s co-founder and managing director  . Keaney, a fluent speaker of Finnish, is an Irishman who ended up in Finland in 1996 and has never left. Keaney has garnered respect as a designer and in 2007 he received both the Ilmari Tapiovaara Award and the Ornamo Design Award. Tonfisk’s co-founder Brian Keaney is an award-winning designer. The design and development of Tonfisk products take place in Finland but the products are now manufactured elsewhere by subcontractors. A special feature of Tonfisk is merging together of wood and porcelain in tableware and interior decoration products. “We are continuously trying to develop something new to ensure that each product has some kind of novel feature. Functionality is also important to us; the product needs to look good and work well,” Keaney says. The wood for the bracelets around the products comes from all over the world, depending on the species of tree used. “The wooden part of our products is not just for decorative purposes; there is always a reason why it’s used. For example, the wooden portion acts as insulation, keeping the drink warm without letting your hands burn,” Keaney says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/indoor-atlas-wants-to-be-the-gps-of-interiors/,Indoor Atlas wants to be the GPS of interiors,"Although the recent employment cuts have hit hard in Oulu, the Northern city doesn’t only echo bad news. New innovation-based startups the likes of Indoor Atlas are now wanting to make use of the skills of those left jobless by big corporations. “Right now, it’s easier than before to find skilled workforce,” says  , the CEO of  . Haverinen’s got work for plenty of hands; the indoor positioning service of Indoor Atlas wants to find its way into every mobile device on the globe. A great push towards the target was given by Baidu, Chinese web service giant, which invested 7.6 million euros in the company. Another 3.3 million euros was raised from Mobility Ventures, Koppi Catch, Vera Ventures, Finnvera and Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation Tekes. From the original group of eight, Indoor Atlas has grown to consist of 17 employees in Oulu, Finland and Silicon Valley, US. Some of them continue to work at the University of Oulu. “It’s good to have a foot in the door in the academic world, too. That way we can follow the newest scientific research,” Haverinen points out. The first steps of Indoor Atlas were taken exactly there, in academia. Haverinen, a professor at the University of Oulu at the time, was attempting to make a robot move northward using the robot’s digital compass. However, the robot wasn’t acting as planned; instead it seemed to wander all over the place. For example steel used in construction disrupts the magnetic fields indoors so that the robot found itself lost. Haverinen placed another robot on the same spot assuming it’d be equally clueless. To his surprise, it turned out the robot was following the exact same complex path as the first one. Haverinen, who’s got 15 years of experience in research, realised that although the building materials affect the magnetic fields, the deviations remain constant. They can be traced with compass sensors and, similarly to outdoors, they can be used in the making of maps. In 2012 Haverinen and seven of his colleagues started Indoor Atlas, a company with the dream of measuring and commercialising the magnetic landscapes of all interiors. In practice, Indoor Atlas can be used for modelling a magnetic map of an indoor area such as a supermarket. A similar process can be completed with the help of a wireless network, but according to Haverinen, Indoor Atlas beats wifi in usability and accuracy. From the original group of eight, Indoor Atlas has grown to consist of 17 employees in Oulu, Finland and Silicon Valley, US. The information is first collected using a mobile phone and then added onto the cloud service of Indoor Atlas. The program can then evaluate the information using algorithms and create a map that can function as a base for indoor positioning in a mobile application. The app can help anyone navigate indoors; for example, it can guide a consumer to his or her favourite porridge oats or today’s offers in a supermarket. So far anyone has been able to register as a user of Indoor Atlas’s indoor positioning service, and its use has been free of charge. In the future the product will include several additional functions, and it will no longer be free to use. Before that the aim is to develop the product and its usability further with several partners. At the moment Indoor Atlas is preparing the newest version of the product ready for launching, after which even small companies and organisations are hoped to try out indoor positioning in their applications globally. Eventually the technology developed by Indoor Atlas can be a standard feature on every smartphone. “It’s interesting to see who ends up making use of the new idea. The invention has got great potential, as although indoor positioning hasn’t got established technologies yet, they are developing at a fast pace,” Haverinen points out. Haverinen says that the company is strongly headed to the international markets. Hence a big chunk of its energy is directed towards the United States, where Indoor Atlas also has an office. Haverinen deems it possible to think that at some point the number of employees will be doubled. The core competencies are, and will remain, in Finland. “Finns are loyal and innovative workers, which helps keeping a clear focus and maintaining long-term goals.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-app-revolutionises-forestry-measurement/,Finnish app revolutionises forestry measurement,"A young Finnish company called Trestima has developed a smartphone app that is revolutionising the way forest timber is surveyed. This innovative app is beginning to replace forestry measurement tools that have been in use since the late 1940s. Two former Nokia employees,     and   felt it was about time forest inventory systems caught up with the digital era. In 2012 they launched  , making forestry surveying processes more cost-efficient, accurate and reliable. Trestima’s Forest Inventory System enables easy capture, cloud storage and analysis of forestry data such as the number, height, width and volume of trees. Russia, the largest forest country in the world, offers the greatest promise for Trestima. “The idea came to me one day while I was skiing in the forest,” says Kivimäki. “Being an engineer, I looked around and wondered if there was an efficient way to quickly measure how many trees there were in that forest. I knew that the old ways were slow and inaccurate.” Kivimäki and Rouvinen developed a smartphone app and tested it in a 20 hectare forest, taking random photos with their phones and analysing the data back in their office. What took them just 40 minutes normally would have taken a full working day with traditional methods, so they knew they were doing something right. “Trestima has helped forestry companies cut down up to one-third of the time their workers have to spend in the forest surveying trees,” declares Kivimäki. “The average measurement speed is now less than five minutes per hectare. Also, the traditional method had an average 25 per cent error rate, whereas our system can get that down to less than ten per cent.” Sweden, Canada and the USA are potential large markets for Tampere-based Trestima. But neighbouring Russia, the largest forest country in the world, offers the greatest promise for Trestima.  , CEO of RusFor Consult Oy Ab, is helping Trestima enter the Russian market. “Russia’s forestry sector is quite inefficient in terms of forest data,” says Rybakov.” So Trestima can really help Russia’s forestry companies to more effectively measure, analyse and manage their forests.” “We have begun negotiations with a number of large Russian forestry companies and are planning pilot projects with them,” Rybakov continues. “One of the companies based in Siberia is already using Trestima and a few more companies based in Karelia, the Leningrad region and the Vologda region have already piloted the service.” According to Kivimäki, being based in Finland is a definite advantage. “We have the best software expertise and technology companies in the world here in Finland. Also, Finnish forest industry groups are among the largest in the world. So it’s not a bad place to have a business like ours.” Kivimäki hopes Trestima will one day become the globally-recognized method for measuring timber in forests. With several new and innovative forestry-related products in the pipeline, Trestima has the potential to become a global player over the next few years. Trestima’s Forest Inventory System enables easy capture, cloud storage and analysis of forestry data such as the number, height, width and volume of trees."

It makes it possible to sing karaoke anywhere where there is a mobile device and network connection. The CEO of the startup company Singster,  , shows us around the company’s modern, light-filled office in the centre of Helsinki. Singster is not just the company’s name but also the name of the social karaoke service it developed. Wait a minute – did you say karaoke? Singster’s CEO Atte Hujanen has previously organised the annual Karaoke World Championships in Finland. “Not many would consider karaoke to be a very sexy industry. But few people know that it is a 10-billion-euro-a-year business,” Hujanen says. Hujanen is no novice in the sector: he has organised the annual Karaoke World Championships in Finland for years; a Finnish invention that has made a name for itself in international circles as well. The company he heads has now launched its first official Singster app, which operates in mobile devices using the iOS user interface. By the end of this year, Singster will become available in other mobile user interfaces and online. “The app has attracted approximately 10 000 users from around the world in less than a week. It works everywhere except North America where copyright laws are different. We are negotiating contracts there as well,” Hujanen says. Singster is available for free for two weeks after which it costs five euros a month. According to Hujanen, the company’s operations will continue to be steered from Helsinki – at least for now. Singster’s founders include a five-person core team as well as the Finnish company KSF Entertainment, which finances the company’s musical content. The karaoke songs used by the company are studio versions of the originals. There are thousands of tunes and more are being added all the time. According to Hujanen, the songs are familiar to people everywhere. “Our objective is for people to automatically use Singster when they want to sing karaoke instead of rummaging around in their closets for old karaoke DVDs.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/uros-thrives-where-users-dare-to-roam/,UROS thrives where users dare to roam,"Low cost data roaming might sound like a contradiction in terms but Finnish company Uros has slashed the price of mobile connectivity. The idea was born three years ago when the company’s founders, outraged by the costs of data when travelling, wondered why foreigners were not able to buy data at local prices. Starting at 5.90 euros per day, users of their   service can get mobile internet access abroad. The service is now available in key business destinations in 60 countries. “People are used to unlimited Internet access experience in their home countries and that’s the experience they would like to have abroad,” says UROS CEO  . “What we have done is make the price a non-issue.” “Business travellers might be spending 200–500 euros a day on fares and hotels. For them, it is a no-brainer to pay the price we are asking.” From its headquarters in Oulu, UROS is covering more and more of the globe with the service offered in the US, Canada, Latin America, Russia, China and Europe. “People are used to unlimited Internet access experience in their home countries and that’s the experience they would like to have abroad”, says UROS CEO Tommi Uhari Uhari says there are one or two European destinations the company is still keen to cover but that most of their effort is going into African expansion at the moment. He adds that if he could relive the last three years, he would think harder about marketing. “For a new company, no matter how brilliant your product is, the challenge is always how do you get all the relevant people to know about it.” “The main focus now is finding time to meet customers and talk to media so that more and more people realise that we have found an innovative way of providing this Internet freedom.” The Goodspeed device, which is roughly the size of an iPhone, functions as a portable Wi-Fi hotspot that can connect up to five devices at a time. It accommodates up to 10 SIM cards at once. Users currently pay for three elements – the device, a monthly service fee and a day pass with a choice of plans to cater for different needs. The pricing system is in line for a shake-up as users have indicated that they would rather see the cost of the device folded into the service fee. Starting this month, the device fee will be waived when users commit to a 24-month contract. The days of SIM swapping and hefty roaming charges may be over but new challenges lie ahead. “The next goal is for the device to support 4G/LTE,” says Uhari."

Some 100 operators make up the cluster that operates under the auspices of the  , forming a unified chain from education and research right through to production. Roughly half of Finland’s medical and diagnostics industry is situated in BioTurku. “The future looks bright, with the markets growing steadily,” says director  . “Turku has a long tradition in the sector, as well as strong research and co-operation between companies and universities. The city focuses on accelerating long-term research and joint projects. On a Nordic scale, infrastructure in the sector is exceptionally ripe and diverse, and the sector also has a good supply of highly educated workforce.” BioTurku focuses on expertise in human health within the life sciences field. Traditionally strong areas are the pharmaceutical industry and diagnostics. Special areas of application include hormonal diseases and cancer, inflammatory and infectious diseases, as well as central nervous system diseases. “Research in these areas is internationally at a high level. Bioimaging in Turku also represents international top quality,and it is increasingly being used both in diagnostics and to support pharmaceutical development,” Piispanen explains. A number of internationally recognised products have also been created and are being manufactured in the Turku region. Among the best-known brands are Bayer’s intrauterine devices Mirena and Jaydess, a time-resolved fluorometer developed by Wallac, Biotie’s Selincro to help reduce alcohol consumption in adults with alcohol dependence, the MariPOC test system for respiratory tract infections, and Abacus’s GenomEra testing system for hospital bacteria. From the outset, the goal for Finland’s biotech sector has been to reach global markets, where, according to Piispanen, the competition is tough. BioTurku contributes to this goal especially in terms of increasing business know-how and readiness for global markets. “We have a lot of international contacts with major corporations and investors. We market Turku’s expertise at various global events and we offer seminars and training in the sector.” Turku is also part of the Council of European Bioregions (CEBR) and ScanBalt, which focuses on the Baltic Region. The goal is to promote business co-operation and to strengthen, through structural means, the competitiveness of European industry compared to Asia and the United States."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/new-lease-of-life-for-scrap-cars/,New lease of life for scrap cars,"Once a car has reached the end of the road, so to speak, its life continues beyond the scrapyard through recycling. In Finland, up to 95 per cent of its materials can be reused. Steel parts are made into pots and pans while tyres end up as crumb rubber at sports stadiums. The recycling of cars is regulated through an EU directive, which specifies that, by 2015, 95 per cent of the weight of a scrap car must be utilised and reclaimed. Finland already reached this target in 2010. Only an average of 50 kilograms of a one tonne car ends up at the landfill, says managing director of  ,  . Suomen Autokierrätys has close to 280 reception points for scrap cars throughout Finland. For car owners, the service is free and has been made as simple as possible. One of the larger operators is  . “First off we remove any liquids, batteries and tyres from the car as well as any recyclable spare parts,” explains director  . “After crushing, we separate the steel, iron, rubber, plastic, textiles and non-ferrous metals.” “Tyre materials are used for, among other things, civil engineering in the foundations of roads and parking lots and as crumb rubber in the astroturf at football stadiums,” Pohjanpalo continues. “New steel products, such as pots and pans are manufactured from the steel. There is plenty of work for copper smelters too.” According to Pohjanpalo, Finland has come a long way. The goal is a challenging one and achieving those last few percentages will be hard work. There are still improvements to be made in the raw material utilisation of plastic parts and in the recovery of glass. Recycled materials have been used in manufacturing a new steel pot. A portion of the pot’s material was once part of a scrap car. In just over 10 years, Hackman, specialised in cookware, has collected more than half a million kilograms of recycled material in the form of old pots and pans through its recycling campaign aimed at consumers. The raw material in the pots and pans can be recovered almost entirely through recycling. “The proportion of recycled material in our cookware products is, on average, 70 per cent,” says kitchen products PR specialist  . “The recycled steel comes from our campaign as well as from various industries, such as the automotive industry. Information on the proportion of recycled material is printed on each product’s packaging.” “The volume of recycled material has been maximised, taking into account the quality requirements of the product,” Syrjälä continues. “We have received good feedback from consumers. Any measures that make a product more eco-friendly and encourage consumers to recycle are always welcome.”"

He has exactly five minutes to impress investors with his presentation on a new-generation mobile jukebox service, which makes music interactive, for example, in bars and restaurants. “Through this app, customers can see a bar’s playlist and request songs for free,” Korhonen says. “Our goal is to make the music experience fun and sociable everywhere in the world.” Crowdfunding was a new concept for Playmysong, and they were open to the idea. The company was interested in the notion that it could potentially acquire a broad base of supporters, although there were no guarantees. The investors had one day to take part in the investment rounds. Korhonen’s pitch was a success, and the end result exceeded his expectations: In just 16 hours, Playmysong inspired 35 investors to put up a total of 25 000 euros. The company was also deemed the winner of the Best Startup Pitch competition, along with co-winner Uniqul, developer of a face recognition payment system. “We secured three investors from the UK, for example, which proves that having an international reach brings concrete results,” Korhonen says. “We amassed a broad group of investors who believed in our story and received direct feedback on our business idea. The future looks bright!” “PitchHelsinki was a successful and ground-breaking experience, and once again proved that Helsinki is a fantastic place for startups,” says Rami Korhonen (right) of Playmysong.

Mäkelä says that crowdfunding puts a completely new spin on how growth companies traditionally secure funding. In the traditional investment model, the first step is to attract the interest of investors, followed by a negotiation of the terms, which are often led by the investors. In crowdfunding, it’s the company that first establishes the terms of the investment rounds, and the investors participate according to those terms. “There’s a lot of talk in Finland about the need for increasing the support provided to startup entrepreneurs,” Mäkelä says. “We have introduced a tool that lowers the threshold for and enables a specific kind of group action to take place.

Spektikor has brought to the markets the world’s lightest single-use ECG indicator and can count NATO among its clients. Another company, Telespro Finland, is specialised in the prevention of heat loss in patients. Telespro’s customers include surgical hospitals, rescue services, first aid centres and ski centres. Its main markets lie in Finland but it also exports to Germany, Sweden, Norway, Northern Ireland, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Canada, among other countries. , an Oulu-based startup company, has created a product that, according to CEO  , competes with three pulse-measuring fingers. The ECG indicator is ideal for the simultaneous observation of several patients that require constant monitoring or are seriously injured. “Typical crisis situations might be accidents, natural disasters, fires or states of war,” Kivistö says. “Above all, the ECG indicator saves emergency personnel time by enabling easy and fast heart rate monitoring in all types of conditions.” Spektikor’s ECG indicator is small, light-weight and easy to use. The device monitors the patient’s pulse continuously, up to 10 hours at a time. A normal pulse is indicated by green blinking lights. If the heart rate does not remain between 40 and 120, the light blinks red. The company introduced the first version of the product to the markets for customers to test in the summer of 2011. From the very beginning, customers around the world were enthusiastic about the product and demand has been steady. A more advanced second version will be launched in 2014. Expectations are high. Spektikor’s ECG indicator is being used all over the world. Key customers include NATO, the Finnish Defence Forces, the Saudi Arabian Army and the Finnish Red Cross. An updated version will hit the markets at the beginning of 2014. Another indicator of how successful the company has been is the delivery contract that they signed with NATO last summer. The contract will allow the ECG indicator to become available in all NATO and partner countries. “The deal was definitely a confidence booster and made us walk tall,” says Kivistö and smiles. At   Finland, operating in Kuopio, they know how to prevent people from losing heat in crisis situations. The company specialises in hospital and rescue service products. “A person’s body can start to cool down in a variety of situations and locations,” says managing director  . “Surprisingly, one of those places is hospital operating theatres where the temperature of nearly all patients declines enough for it to be classed as hypothermia.” “Our core expertise is identifying precisely those situations in which a person’s body temperature can decline and in which this lower body temperature can be dangerous,” Hakkarainen continues. “We identify the causes and consequences and can create products that enable the prevention of crises.” “T-Balance, our new product preventing heat loss in surgical patients, is expected to be an even bigger export success than our earlier products. During the winter we will launch four new products within the product range, so the future looks really bright,” Hakkarainen concludes."

The event included workshops where participants brainstormed hopes and needs for future services, which would form the basis for implementing necessary development measures. “Sudan is one example of a country where Finnish expertise is exported,” Pietarila says. “We also have bilateral projects, for example, in Malawi, Vietnam, Nepal, Ecuador and Colombia, as well as regional projects related to the modernisation of weather services and early warning systems in, among other places, the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean, the Andes, and the Balkans. “Co-operation in the areas of climate change and renewable energy is also prevalent around the globe,” Pietarila adds. According to Pietarila, the unique nature of Finnish expertise can also strongly be attributed to the world’s leading manufacturer of weather devices – the Finnish company  , which offers full-scale weather measurement solutions. “Today, Vaisala’s devices and solutions are critical in making global weather observations,” Pietarila stresses.  A number of natural disasters are related to extreme weather phenomena, such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, hailstorms, tornadoes, downpours, floods and heavy winds, which could cause serious damage to people and property. “Our products and services are used to monitor, identify and forecast weather conditions, so that authorities can properly time warnings and possibly rescue measures,” explains Vaisala’s communications director,  . “The products used are radiosondes and dropsondes, automatic weather stations, weather radars, and thunderstorm and lightning detection systems” Vaisala’s weather observation devices and solutions are used worldwide, for instance, by national meteorological institutes, airport authorities and airport maintenance operators, as well as by road authorities and road maintenance organisations. The company exports to as many as 150 countries every year. On Monday, Vaisala signed a contract with the Turkish State Meteorological Service on the delivery of seven weather radars. The value of the equipment deliveries scheduled to begin in summer of 2014 is 6.3 million euros."

And at the same time, foreigners are surprised that you can drive a car on a frozen lake in below 30 degree weather. No wonder ice circuits are attracting so many drivers. Because winter driving is just another case of practice makes perfect. The  , bearing the name of the four-time rally world champion, offers training in driving fast and on slippery terrain in safe conditions. The Kuusamo area offers a selection of ice circuits combined with breath-taking scenery and incredible experiences. “When we drive, in freezing cold weather, onto the ice on a 10-tonne tractor, many people consider the experience a unique one according to the feedback we’ve received,” says   and smiles. The most popular product is the fast driving course that is tailored to meet the needs of individual drivers. For some, clean driving and learning the “power slide” are important, for others it is the use of a car’s modern safety equipment in extreme conditions. “We also provide training for companies and people who drive a lot in their work,” Kettunen says. “We go into how the car’s ESP system works, how to carry out emergency evasive manoeuvres and how the car functions without safety equipment, all at high speeds.” “Practicing driving is individualised to match the customer’s level of knowledge and skills,” Kettunen continues. “Our customers also include race-car drivers and people aiming at a career in racing, who come to brush up their skills and learn something new.” One of our fastest programmes is “Rally Taxi” where the customer gets to act as co-driver to   himself along a narrow frozen stretch of road. “The trees along the beautiful wintery road become a blur, as you whizz by exciting crossings and the speedometer exceeds 200 kilometres per hour,” Kettunen describes the experience. Drivers from all over the world arrive in Kuusamo to train in extreme conditions. Its location in guaranteed cold conditions and its excellent circuits have also piqued the interest of automobile manufacturers. For example, Bentley, the British car manufacturer, invites its customers to practice winter driving in Finnish Lapland. So how good are Finns at driving in winter? “Better than average because, here, winter arrives each year,” Kettunen says. “Foreign customers are happy to drive around in a circle for three hours, but Finns want to move on to the next activity after just 10 minutes.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-arctic-maritime-transport-expert/,Finland — Arctic maritime transport expert,"Finland is the only country where the Baltic Sea, a crucial maritime transport route, freezes every winter. “Due to these conditions, we have developed know-how in Arctic maritime transport, which is in high demand, even in a tightening competitive situation,” says Mikko Niini, Aker Arctic’s managing director. Although this winter so far has been exceptionally mild and ice-free, the maritime areas around Finland are usually covered in ice for several months of the year. At its most extensive, it typically covers roughly half of the Baltic Sea, and in very cold winters, all of it. More than 90 per cent of Finland’s export trade is transported by sea; this fact has been a catalyst for Finns to develop innovative Arctic technology and know-how. Arctic maritime transport today offers business opportunities not only to the engineering company  , but also to several shipping companies and shipyards. Niini sees a relatively bright future for the sector. Continuous growth, albeit no boom in Arctic maritime transport, is in sight. Opportunities exist, but the development will be long term and sluggish, and will take place in small steps. “The Baltic Sea is, for Finland, a prototype workshop of sorts, and it serves as a good springboard,” Niini says. “Over the past 10 years, for example, more than 20 Arctic seagoing vessels have been built in the world on the basis of Finnish engineering.” The greatest growth prospects are in Russia, which boasts a good amount of mining, gas and oil projects that require maritime transport knowledge. Growth prospects can also be seen in Canada. According to Niini, the world’s best icebreakers are still being built in Finland, although competition is becoming more intense all the time. “Asian countries, such as Korea, but also Germany, represent a challenge to the competitiveness of our manufacturing industry,” reckons Niini. “Nevertheless, demand for our unique Arctic expertise, which has been built up through our history and geographical position, will hold strong in future, too.”  is also contributing to the future of Finland’s Arctic maritime transport by launching a 100 million-euro Arctic sea programme, which targets billions of euros in new business. The programme will help speed up the development and introduction of new products and services in the markets. The three-year programme will continue until 2017. The key business areas of the programme are environmental technology, Arctic and other maritime transport, offshore industry, maritime industry and new business based on Arctic expertise. A competitive edge will be sought particularly in environmental and ICT know-how. “We believe that Finnish companies are the most effective partners when creating sustainable business in Arctic conditions,” says  , executive director at Tekes. “And with Finnish solutions, operations can be built on an environmentally sound basis.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arctic-ambassador-a-hot-topic/,Arctic Ambassador — a hot topic,"Just looking at his title, you know Hannu Halinen is doing an important job. Finland’s Arctic Ambassador co-ordinates the Finnish state administration’s Arctic strategy, and is thus responsible for matters that are subject to increasing interest globally. — This is definitely about working for the future, Halinen says. The Arctic Council is an international intergovernmental high-level discussion forum. The Council’s mission is to promote co-operation and co-ordination between the actors in the Arctic region. Its members are Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Canada, Russia and the United States, as well as six indigenous peoples’ organisations, such as the Saami Council. Counsellor for Foreign Affairs   was appointed Arctic Ambassador in 2009, when the then Minister for Foreign Affairs   created the position to put Arctic affairs into the spotlight. A similar position had existed earlier, but this time round the concept was updated. “Arctic issues came to the forefront when the surprisingly rapid melting of ice was detected in 2007,” Halinen recounts. “This created a new kind of demand for the position of Arctic Ambassador.” Halinen’s role is by no means unique. Similar positions exist in practically all of the Arctic Council member states. Halinen’s annual travels amount to around one hundred days, with frequent trips to Svalbard and Greenland. Co-operation on an international level in various bodies keeps him busy. Finland’s first Arctic strategy was completed in 2010. At that time, the Government set up an Arctic Advisory Board to support and monitor Finland’s policy and activity in the Arctic region, build awareness for Arctic issues and maintain contacts with the bodies set up in other countries. Halinen serves as Secretary-General of the Advisory Board. “In 2012, the Government wanted to introduce a new strategy with a broader scope, which was adopted in August last year,” Halinen says. “The strategy includes 50 objectives and 125 actions to be monitored. Compared to the strategies in place in other countries, Finland’s is clearly the broadest, clearest and most concrete. Our strategy has also sparked interest globally, and I have already presented it in many countries.” The core of the Arctic strategy lies in the Government’s vision for Finland to be an active and responsible Arctic actor. “As the objective is to reconcile the business opportunities provided and limitations imposed by the environment, this can also be seen as conflicted,” Halinen stresses. “However, placing the region under protection is not a realistic option. The use of natural resources cannot be avoided, which means it should be carried out as sustainably and responsibly as possible.” Finland has inherent expertise in a number of fields, such as Arctic marine technology and maritime transport from engineering to execution, monitoring and assessment of the conditions in the Arctic region, training and research in the field, energy business, as well as mining and combating oil spills in ice conditions. “New opportunities are constantly emerging,” Halinen believes. “For example in tourism, we already are an Arctic superpower, as around 90 per cent of the region’s hotel beds can be found in Lapland. There will certainly be growing demand for expertise in the Arctic service sector in future too.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/clearing-the-way-for-road-safety/,Clearing the way for road safety,"Finnish weather technology is becoming a significant export. Promising markets for smart traffic weather services can be found in Northern Europe and Russia. Arctic Machine has gained a strong foothold in these markets. The company’s snow loaders will be used to keep roads clear of snow during this February’s Winter Olympics in Sochi. , a family company with an international reach, is known for its intelligent road maintenance vehicles, among other things. The company equips road maintenance vehicles with everything needed for snow clearance and antiskid treatment as well as data collection and reporting. “All the equipment can be controlled using a single control unit, making the vehicle efficient to handle,” explains CEO  . “The intelligent equipment improves road maintenance quality and enables cost benefits.” According to Jääskelä, snow and ice clearance is a narrow segment comprising a great deal of expertise in different fields. What is unique about Arctic Machine is its comprehensive expertise. Over half of the company’s turnover comes from the Nordic and Baltic countries and its main market, Russia. The company’s latest advance is a snow thrower designed to remove snow and ice from railway tracks, which was delivered to the City of Helsinki last October. This year’s mild winter is bringing Jääskelä down. “It’s January already and we still haven’t had the chance to try out the new unit,” Jääskelä says. “Next week we’re even supposed to have international guests over to take a look at the new product. But it is already clear that our product development will lead to new business opportunities in the rail segment.” Arctic Machine is expecting a busy year despite the lack of snow so far. “Last year our turnover increased 10–15 per cent,” Jääskelä says. “We’re expecting to see a similar increase this year.” Jääskelä feels it is important to continue the development of Finnish arctic technology. Combining the know-how of different companies would achieve synergies and new business opportunities. Co-operation is encouraged by the Finnish Road Weather Excellence (FIRWE) project, which is funded by  , the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Other participants in the project, besides Arctic Machine, include VTT, Vaisala Foreca and Teconer. “For example, mobile sensors and advanced technology can provide more up-to-date weather information,” says  , a research scientist at  . “With more timely and accurate information it is possible to offer road users better warning services and optimise the use of road salt, which would benefit the environment.” Through FIRWE, VTT is creating a network for SMEs interested in export projects and offers research support to help develop services and find potential target markets. “We promote the development of services that are beneficial to society, the growth and internationalisation of SMEs as well as employment opportunities,” Hautala sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sayduck-raises-eur-350k-of-seed-investment/,Sayduck raises EUR 350 000 in seed investments,"Sayduck, a Helsinki-based company specialising in online shopping enhanced by augmented reality, has raised 350 000 euros of seed funding, mainly from international investors. The company intends to use the funding to boost its growth and product development and to expand to the US market.  sprouted partly from personal need – CEO   and other Sayduck founders are not avid furniture store visitors. However, buying furniture online was difficult, as small photos rarely give a realistic idea of how a chair or a bookcase would look in one’s own living room. They developed a solution that enables users to place furniture in their home virtually to see how it would look. The technology is called augmented reality. With Sayduck’s application, users only need to point their smartphone camera to the spot where they wish to see the new piece of furniture. The application combines the real environment of one’s home with the digital picture of the desired piece of furniture. If the user is satisfied, he or she can purchase the product online. “Initially our application was built for furniture but we are now expanding its use to fashion, particularly handbags and shoes,” Martikainen says. “It enables trying how e.g. a new purse would look with a certain outfit. For companies, this offers enhanced online sales as they can bring their products virtually to the customer’s home.” Sayduck recently raised 350 000 euros of seed funding mainly from international investors. The company already has a few clients in the United States and plans to set up a sales organisation there. The funding helps in crossing the Atlantic but before that, Sayduck intends to use it to recruit additional staff and to further develop its product. At the moment, Sayduck has offices in Helsinki and London, and sales representatives in a few other countries. It has 15 employees and runs operations from software development to sales and marketing. “The investment helps boost our growth,” Martikainen says. “We plan to hire 10 more employees within the next year, mainly in Finland and the US. The Finnish market is an important test field for us, because we have a couple of very forward-thinking Finnish furniture manufacturers as partners. These partnerships help us test and develop our application.” In addition to growing and expanding its solution to strong fashion brands, Sayduck aims to make its application as easy and straightforward to use as possible. “Augmented reality often focuses too much on technology at the expense of the end-user,” Martikainen says. “We operate a bit like Apple, that is, we work on a few carefully thought-out things but do them as well as possible.” The strategy appears to be working. Sayduck’s clients already include Alessi, Inno, Adidas and Onitsuka Tiger."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/insulation-in-high-demand-in-russia/,Insulation in high demand in Russia,"CEO Kari Lehtinen is of the opinion that Finland needs good news “these days”. The insulation factory recently opened by Paroc in Russia is definitely good news, and a response to the growing demand for energy-efficient construction. The new factory that was opened last December in Izoplit, Russia, represents around 60 million euros in investments. However, it is only the first step in a larger investment programme estimated to amount to roughly 170 million euros in total. According to Lehtinen, the plan is to carry out further investments in stages over the next few years in Tver. “The new factory is in line with our growth strategy,” Lehtinen says. “We have supplied products to Russia for more than 20 years, but the new factory will open up new opportunities for us. Local manufacturing close to our customers will improve our operations and increase our efficiency.” Confident of the brisk growth in the Russian markets,   has announced its intention to double the net sales of its operations in Russia by 2015. If Russian exports accounted for about 7 per cent in 2012 of the company’s total net sales of 430 million euros, their share will be close to 15 per cent next year. These expectations are well founded. According to Lehtinen, demand for building insulation in Russia grows at an annual rate of about 8—10 per cent, which is more than in many other markets. This is attributable to, among other factors, the major boom in housing construction. As new construction activity increases, renovation construction follows suit. Industrial buildings, such as power plants, are also being constructed at an ever-increasing pace. In the large markets of Russia, the volumes are big. In Russia, growth in new construction means growth in energy efficiency, as the country is following the construction trends of Western countries. The law enacted in Russia in 2008 stipulates that energy efficiency should improve by 40 per cent over the coming years. “Competition is fierce in the sector, prompting all actors to develop their operations,” Lehtinen says. “However, they are all playing in the same battlefield. We are now powered by a strong drive. We strongly believe in our expertise, our products and our operations.” “The new factory also bears testament to the strengthening partnership between Finland and Russia,” Lehtinen points out. Paroc, recognised at construction sites for its red-and-white-striped packaging, develops and tests building technology solutions that reduce both energy consumption and emissions. Alongside Russia, the company’s core markets are to be found in the Nordic countries and the Baltics."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/glass-infinitely-recyclable/,Glass – infinitely recyclable,"Of all packaging materials, glass is the only one that can be recycled indefinitely without compromising its quality. In Finland, 95 per cent of all deposit bottles are recycled. “We have a good system and refunds to thank for the good recycling rate of deposit bottles,” explains  , managing director of  . The company offers collection and cleaning services for recyclable glass. Recyclable glass can mean anything from bottles to windows or car windshields. At the company’s recycling facility that serves the whole of Finland the glass is crushed, cleaned and sorted by colour. “Recyclable glass is refined into a reusable raw material, called cullet,” Julin says. “We handle roughly 90 000 tonnes of recycled glass annually.” Deposit bottles are recycled efficiently, but non-refundable glass has a distinctly lower recycling rate. So there is still a lot left to be done. But where can a regular consumer expect to find recycled glass, except for in drink bottles? “Consumers often come in contact with recycled products without knowing it,” Julin says. “Besides new glass containers, recycled glass is also used for products such as glass wool and foamed glass.” “Glass wool is used for wall and ceiling insulation and foamed glass aggregate is mostly used in construction, but also to protect infrastructure and buildings against frost heave,” Julin says. “Glass recycling creates export revenue for Finland, but it is also beneficial for the environment,” Lassi Julin points out. Uusioaines is the leading glass recycler in Finland. The company collects glass throughout Finland, but also sells its products internationally. Most of the cullet and part of the foamed glass aggregate is sold abroad. “  foamed glass is an environmentally friendly insulation material and lightweight filler, and is produced from cleaned recycled glass,” Julin explains. “Foamed glass can be used to protect roads against frost heave, as thermal insulation in buildings or as a lightweight filler in foundations.” “Glass recycling creates export revenue for Finland, but it is also beneficial for the environment,” Julin says. “The use of cullet reduces energy and raw material needs, CO2 emissions and the use of landfill sites.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-experts-guarantee-snow-in-sochi/,Finnish experts guarantee snow in Sochi,"The Finnish company Snow Secure will make sure there is plenty of snow at the Sochi Winter Olympics in February, no matter the conditions. Two other Finnish companies, Onninen and All-Weather SnowTek, are also prepped for the snowy task.  specialises in solving snow-related challenges and is in charge of the snow contingency master plan for the Sochi Winter Olympics. The company has been providing the Olympics organisers with expert snow services for the past three years. In this role  , managing director, Snow Secure, has visited the mountains of Sochi dozens of times. “It is always winter in Sochi, and its mountains offer ideal conditions for ski resorts,” Martikainen says. “However, when it comes to the Olympics, they wanted to leave nothing to chance. Storing snow to ensure a sufficient supply of it is like having insurance.” In addition to normal conditions, the snow contingency plan addresses extreme weather conditions, such as the warmest winter in 150 years. Should the winter be warm, problems with snow may arise at altitudes less than 1 400 meters, which is where many of the Olympic sports venues are located. The amount of snow required for the Sochi Olympics exceeds one million cubic meters. The situation is currently good, as the amount of snow stored during the previous winter totalled some 450 000 cubic meters at the end of November, and thanks to the cold December weather, the ordinary snow-making systems could be used to create some more. “All snow-making equipment in modern ski resorts turn water into snow with the help of sub-zero outdoor temperatures,” Martikainen explains. “The condition of ski slopes can also be secured by storing snow over the summer or by making snow with equipment capable of functioning in above-zero temperatures.” Twelve years ago, Martikainen developed a snow storing concept, which is now in use throughout Europe for winter sports. “Storing snow is an ecological and economic way of ensuring sufficient snow,” Martikainen says. “It creates savings and additional revenues for the client. Snow is money.” The Sochi Olympics’ ski jumping centre also resorts to Finnish experts when it comes to ensuring snow supply.  ’s snow-making equipment, capable of producing snow in above-zero temperatures, can produce about 10 000 cubic meters of snow for the Nordic combined ski tracks, if necessary. Onninen’s partner and equipment manufacturer is the Finnish company  , which has long experience in the field. The system delivered to Sochi is able to guarantee the production of snow even when the outside temperature is +10°C, and even in rain. The companies owning the venues are responsible for the detailed planning of the Olympics, and purchasing and operation of the snow-making systems. They are supported by several Russian and foreign snow expert companies and personnel."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/clean-laundry-with-biogas/,Clean laundry with biogas,"An Oulu-based company pumps biogas from a landfill for direct utilisation in industrial processes. Biogas is used to manufacture building insulation, disinfect hospital instruments, wash laundry, generate electricity and, possibly in future, also to produce traffic fuel. Biogas is formed by microbes decomposing organic matter in anaerobic conditions, such as at a landfill. It is a gas mixture containing 40–70% methane and 30–60% carbon dioxide. Methane is a greenhouse gas 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced through the recovery and utilisation of biogas. The recovery of landfill biogas is regulated by an EU directive. In Finland, the recovery and utilisation of biogas have been required by law since the beginning of 2002. Oulun Jätehuolto made biogas utilisation a business way back in 1998. “For us, the biogas pumping station is not just an environmental investment, but also an energy investment which has paid itself back many times over,” says managing director of Oulun Jätehuolto,  . “Biogas makes up a significant proportion of our turnover.” Biogas can be produced either with biogas reactors or by collecting landfill biogas using pumps. Oulun Jätehuolto pumps biogas at two landfills, cleans it and dewaters it. After that, the biogas is fed to the distribution network and into industrial processes, such as those of Paroc Group, which manufactures stone wool insulation for the construction industry. “I met the company’s then managing director at a seminar,” Illikainen recounts. “When he mentioned that the company was planning to switch from heavy oil to LPG, I immediately made him an offer for biogas, as our plant was just about to be completed.” “And that was the start,” Illikainen says. “At the same time, Paroc became the first industrial enterprise in Europe to utilise landfill gas in its processes.” Today, Oulun Jätehuolto’s biogas is also used by Lindström’s hand towel washing plant. For the company, biogas provides an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, which, in turn, is perfectly in line with the company’s environmental targets. At the turn of the millennium, Oulun Energia invested in a 7-km-long gas transfer pipeline in order to utilise the biogas produced by Oulun Jätehuolto at Oulu University Hospital. The gas is used as a fuel in steam production for the hospital, i.e. it is used to boil water. Hot water vapour can be used in the disinfection of hospital instruments and in the hospital’s laundry facility. “In addition, we use biogas to produce the electricity needed by Rusko’s waste collection centre,” Illikainen says. “The electricity is generated by three micro-turbines and the waste heat arising from the process is used for heating buildings.” “Thanks to our self-sufficient electricity production, we achieve annual savings of roughly 100 000 euros,” Illikainen points out. “Our biogas solution might just be the most optimal one in the world.” Oulun Jätehuolto is about to commission a process based on biowaste digestion technology in addition to composting. Next year, it also plans to start producing traffic fuels from biogas. Gasum is one example of the Finnish companies that are already transforming biogas into traffic fuel as well as using it for electricity, district heat and energy production. The energy company   is also known as a producer of eco-friendly fuels and renewable energy."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/construction-waste-recycling-gets-a-boost/,Construction-waste recycling gets a boost,"On a construction, renovation or demolition site, there is always leftover material that must be disposed of. Even though the methods for processing construction waste have become more diversified, and less and less waste ends up at the landfill, a lot still needs to be done. The ReUSE project is among the initiatives aimed at boosting this development. The annual volume of construction waste in EU countries amounts to 800 million tonnes, which is around a third of all the waste generated in Europe. Finland produces around 20–24 million tonnes of construction waste a year, mainly consisting of soil. “Building construction is one of the largest consumers of natural resources in Finland, with an annual consumption of 10 million tonnes of construction materials and products,” says ministerial adviser   from the . “Excluding soil, construction generates approximately 2.2 million tonnes of waste.” “The highest amounts of waste come from renovation, an area that is increasingly becoming the focus of the entire construction business,” Peuranne continues. “Waste volumes can therefore be expected to continue to grow.” The focus of construction activity is shifting towards renovation. The EU’s waste directive requires member states to recycle 70 per cent of their construction and demolition waste as material by 2020. In Finland, the opportunities for recycling construction waste vary both according to type of waste and region. “Low-quality wood waste, in particular, is difficult to recycle as material, so it is essentially combusted,” Peuranne says. “On the other hand, sheet metal and other scrap metal are coveted raw materials for industry, among other things.” “Concrete from demolition sites is largely crushed for use in construction,” Peuranne continues. “Despite all this, some 250 000 tonnes of construction waste ends up at the landfill.” Finland’s recycling rate for construction and demolition waste is estimated at around 26 per cent, excluding the use of waste for energy production. In the EU, the average is 47 per cent. In an international comparison, Denmark and the Netherlands are in the lead. One of the main reasons behind Finland’s figures is the high proportion of wood waste. The ReUSE project, co-ordinated by   Technical Research Centre of Finland and co-funded by the Ministry of the Environment, the Tampere University of Technology, Ekokem and Finnish Wood Research, is an initiative launched to boost the recycling and reuse of construction waste. As an element of sustainable development, natural resource economy and life cycle thinking, recycling should always be part of the design and building process. “The purpose of the project is to look at how we can make greater use of used building components and construction waste, while at the same time uncovering new opportunities in waste recovery,” says research scientist    . According to Hradil, the recycling process works well from the viewpoint of waste collecting, processing and reuse, and it has been in place for a long time in many countries, but things could be taken a lot further. Right now, very little experience exists in, for example, designing a new building based on recycled materials or in designing a new building so that it can be recycled. “Finland has a high level of expertise in the field, which puts it in good position to carry out development work,” Hradil says. “As an element of sustainable development, natural resource economy and life cycle thinking, recycling should always be part of the design and building process.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/teemu-arina-hacked-himself-back-to-health/,Teemu Arina “hacked” himself back to health,"For Teemu Arina, technology is an extension of his body. He, for example, recovered from a gastric ulcer by hacking. Writing and speaking keep him busy, but this serial tech entrepreneur has also developed a popular online tool for working life management. Aged 31,   has been studying the human-machine interface from several angles for 15 years already. He was a 16-year-old high school student when he teamed up with a friend to create his first company, with a special permit required under Finnish law. “We developed an online learning environment, the key idea of which was to support community learning,” Arina says. “We launched the service as an open source code and thus benefited from the input of a number of external developers. “The service was translated into 15 languages and had several major clients around the world, such as the United States Armed Forces and the European Space Programme,” Arina continues. All this was done from his bedroom in his parents’ house. Today, Arina runs two companies: the digital business accelerator Dicole and  , a company that develops a new kind of online tool for organising meetings. Despite his high level of enthusiasm and motivation, Arina reached his limit. There was too much to do and too little  . He was treated for what had been diagnosed as a stress-induced gastric ulcer, but his condition persisted until there was only one option left: he had to heal himself. “I looked at myself as an intricate system, a sort of biological computer that can be reprogrammed,” Arina says. “I learned about nutrition, molecular biology and biochemistry, with the objective of regaining my health by ‘hacking’. On the basis of the information I gathered, I set a hypothesis: if I make these changes in my life, I’ll restore balance to my system.” Arina drew on self-quantification tools which enabled him to get quick feedback on what he was doing and to set small daily targets in order to make the change happen. Arina presents the Meetin.gs service to Finland’s Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade, Alexander Stubb, at the Mobile World Congress 2014. Busy entrepreneurs still continue to be faced with time issues, but today, a variety of tools are available to improve performance. One of the concrete methods available is the Meetin.gs service, which is aimed at increasing the efficiency of meetings, and was the winner of the online application category at the The Next Web Europe Conference 2013. “According to our estimates, we spend a quarter of the work week attending meetings,” Arina says. “And we spend a good proportion of the rest of the time preparing these meetings and performing the tasks related to them. Poorly prepared meetings take longer and people arrive late or are poorly briefed.” “In our view, the issue is not the people, but the tools and the ways of doing things,” Arina continues. “Meetin.gs manages the entire life cycle of a meeting. It also works with people outside the company who do not have access to the same systems. Our service already has 30 000 users.” The current technology is just a prelude. In a couple of decades, technology will be an invisible part of our daily life. When that time comes, Arina does not think, for example, that he will be carrying a phone in his pocket."

Smart shorts, of course! Developed by the Kuopio-based company Myontec, and introduced to the markets a few months ago, this innovation is already opening doors for new applications. The   sports shorts provide the person who is wearing them important real-time information about their muscles during and after exercise. The product can be used to improve technique, performance and the quality of training as well as to identify problems and prevent stress injuries. “While a heart rate monitor measures cardiovascular function as a sort of ‘fuel pump’, Mbody measures muscle performance, i.e. the functioning of the body’s ‘engine’,” describes  ,  ’s CEO. Mbody is targeted at both professional athletes and ‘heavy user’ consumers, such as marathoners, cyclists and triathletes. The customer base also includes coaching centres and sports clubs. In addition, physiotherapists are interested in the product as a tool for observing muscle training. “Later on, we will also launch simpler and more affordable versions aimed at a wider audience to motivate people to be physically active and to improve their performance without nasty muscle problems,” Tolvanen says. “We are currently studying the most interesting applications.” In just over 10 years, Mbody’s product development has come a long way. Tolvanen remembers trying out various old measuring devices, with their heavy equipment and wires that he had to attach to his legs before going biking. In the early stages, the data collected was difficult to access, but it was interesting to the point that it provided direction for product development. Myontec’s Board Chair, Antti Pihlakoski, is delighted about the company’s success at the Wearable Technology Innovation World Cup. The first smart piece of clothing ever introduced to the market, the Mbody sports shorts have met with great interest. The most recent proof of that is the Finnish Sport Product of the Year mention the product received at the GoExpo fair in Helsinki in March. Previously, the product has won, among other prizes, the Wearable Technology Innovation World Cup in the Sports & Fitness category. At least for now, the product is one of a kind. According to Tolvanen, a few shirts that measure heart rate and body movements are available, but there is nothing like Mbody out there. The market prospects look promising. The market for heart rate monitors alone is some 600 million euros annually. “The market for wearable technology is experiencing strong growth and the proportion of smart clothes is increasing significantly. Initially, smart clothes will be used in sports and exercise, but later on, they will also be used in various ways as a means of improving wellbeing and increasing physical activity. We expect to see significant growth and new applications for this innovation.”"

The company will focus the development of its cloud-based platform in Finland and plans to employ 50 people already at an early stage. Telrock provides automated self-serve customer service applications for mobile devices. Although only four years old, the company’s customers include some of the world’s largest financial institutions and other corporations. Telrock’s solution hands over control of various services to customers, diminishing the need for traditional call center agents. Letting consumers decide how to use services increases customer satisfaction and loyalty. “Our platform gives for example bank customers total control of managing their loans with their mobile device – they can change the amount and date of payments every month if they wish to,” says  , executive chairman at Telrock. “Consumers can now manage services that previously required customer service personnel.” Furthermore, Telrock wants to create a mobile customer service innovation ecosystem in Finland as well as offer Finnish startups an open application programming interface and a chance to bring their products to the international market through Telrock’s platform. The platform provides access to over two billion consumers, 10 000 companies and 300 mobile operators. Telrock is growing rapidly and has offices in the UK and the US and is building sales and support organisations in Canada and South Africa. At the end of last year the company was also looking for a new location in Europe. “Last November, we participated in the Slush startup event in Finland,” Gunter says. “We met people from the KAATO network. They set the wheels in motion, and only a couple of weeks later we had found our first Finnish employees.” “We also received help from other Finnish organisations, e.g. Invest in Finland, Greater Helsinki Promotion and Otaniemi Marketing,” Gunter points out. Telrock plans to focus the development of its platform in Finland and make Finland a regional sales centre serving the non-English-speaking Europe. The Oulu office will concentrate mainly on product development, while the Helsinki office will focus more on sales. “We were looking for a country with mobile talent, great work ethic and entrepreneurial zeal, and have found these in Finland,” Gunter says. “Now we want to employ what we call ninjas, that is people who understand the opportunities and want to change the world.” Telrock plans to employ ca. 50 people in Finland already at an early stage but does not plan to stop growth and recruiting at that. The company’s plans also include developing new technologies, like advanced natural language processing, machine learning as well as voice and facial recognition, and incorporating them into its platform. The next version of Telrock’s platform will be launched by the end of the year."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/electronics-on-your-skin/,Electronics on your skin,"Wearable electronics, such as smart watches and smart bracelets, are currently making a breakthrough comparable to that of mobile phones a couple of decades ago. They are only at the beginning of their development cycle, but the possibilities they offer are infinite. Finnish expertise goes a long way, if you ask   CEO    . His company lives and breaths the smart bracelet megatrend, developing software that can serve as a platform for several manufacturers, equipment and functionalities. Suunto, Polar and Nokia have been pioneers in this sector for a long time. That provides a solid foundation from which to take the next step. In a few years’ time, wearable devices will have reached a technical level high enough to be launched on the mass market. Koru develops raw materials for future generations’ life management devices. The technology is unique, as it enables entirely new kinds of user experiences – quickly and energy-efficiently, with a small memory capacity and at low operating costs. “We are not aware of technology like this existing anywhere else in the world,” says Lindholm. “Wearable computers, in other words smart bracelets, do exist, but they use existing platforms which bring certain challenges, such as quickly depleting batteries.” “We are currently in the process of developing the first generation of smart watches,” Lindholm continues. “The biggest difference compared with previously known sports watches is that the products are, in a way, an extension of your mobile phone. The uniqueness of our approach is best showcased by the easy scalability of our platform for various consumer segments.” Christian Lindholm believes in Finnish expertise in developing wearable electronics. Lindholm believes that the product made possible by the new software will be an invention just as revolutionary as the mobile phone once was. Interest in the product is already there, but the market still needs to mature to become a mass market. “Wearable electronics enable the user to do all the things that mobile phones are used for today, but without a large screen: communicate, organise day-to-day activities, pay bills, play games,” Lindholm explains. “Smart bracelets are fashion, design and technology all rolled into one. I believe that manufacturers will understand that these are the keys to success of wearable electronics,” says Lindholm. As the devices get smaller and their price decreases, technology can be worn in many ways, such as in the form of jewelry. Possible applications are also being developed at Aalto University, for example. “To date, wearable electronics have mainly been used in sports, entertainment, medicine and military applications,” says producer  from Aalto Media Factory. “While broad-scale commercialisation is in its infancy, the possibilities are practically endless.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/augmented-reality-brings-a-new-dimension/,Augmented reality brings a new dimension,"Digital and physical lives still largely evolve in separate spheres. Services relating to what is called augmented reality merge these two worlds, creating a seamless experience. The possibilities are practically endless. ’s key account manager     knows what he’s talking about. According to him, augmented reality (AR) brings a new dimension to the human eye. “Today, we are already capable of using, for example, a separate navigator, but AR makes it possible to superimpose a map, a compass, the current location and journey instructions in a real view, for example on the windscreen of a car,” Nurmi explains. “When viewing buildings or other sites using the camera of a mobile device, we can obtain information about them without making any further enquiries.” It is not future visions but today’s reality that Nurmi is talking about: these kinds of consumer services have long been available in various manufacturers’ apps. For example, LiveSight, the augmented reality technology developed by Nokia’s map unit  , is available in HERE apps for all Windows Phone 8 phones. There are a myriad of uses: HERE Maps helps you explore the world around you and locate your destination, HERE Drive makes it easy to find your parked car and HERE Transit shows the nearby public transport stations. With LiveSight, we use our sense of vision and the world becomes an interface. We break down the complexity of the world around us, bringing to the forefront what is important from the current perspective “To date, we have used a top-down approach to presenting the world on maps,” explains social media specialist  . “With LiveSight, we use our sense of vision and the world becomes an interface. We break down the complexity of the world around us, bringing to the forefront what is important from the current perspective.” “When exploring our environment, we mostly rely on our sense of vision, but with LiveSight we can really see the place we’re looking for and know how to find the best way there even in heavy traffic conditions,” Suikkila continues. “LiveSight also makes it easier to reach the destination when the house numbers are not visible or when all the houses look the same. The app helps you see the journey’s end,” Suikkila points out. According to Suikkila, LiveSight is one of the HERE apps’ most beloved features. “It is possible that in future this feature will be brought from the outdoors to inside buildings, for example to serve as a guide in shopping centres and concerts: it will help you find a specific store or see where your friend is seated,” Suikkila says. Nurmi also sees limitless potential for augmented reality, once today’s limited uses and technological restrictions are resolved and user numbers increase. “As the technology and cloud services gain more ground and become more efficient, it will be possible to offer consumers huge amounts of information about the real world around them. New interfaces, such as eye control, will also further improve the user experience. We can thus expect the services offered to be even smarter in the future.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/capital-legal-services-sets-foot-in-helsinki-as-the-first-russian-law-firm/,Capital Legal Services sets foot in Helsinki as the first Russian law firm,"Russian law firm Capital Legal Services (CLS) has opened an office in Finland to offer increased support for international companies entering the Russian market. Due to its proximity, Helsinki was a natural choice for CLS’ first foreign office.  Opening an office in Helsinki was a logical step for Capital Legal Services (CLS) which regularly assists Finnish companies doing business in Russia. But it is not only Finns that CLS sees as potential clients in Helsinki, thanks to the city’s good connections and the presence of many international companies. The Helsinki office will support CLS’ existing offices in St. Petersburg and Moscow in providing services to international clients. ”Many American, Japanese and Korean companies choose Finland as a gateway to Russia. Finland and Russia have long economic ties and it only takes 3.5 hours to get to St. Petersburg from Helsinki by train. It’s important to understand that the Russian market isn’t saturated yet and there is room for new products and services. There is great potential for growth,” explains  , managing partner of CLS. “Lots of people don’t understand what kind of issues to expect when entering the Russian market. We are ready to help companies which are still a bit hesitant about coming to Russia because of this. We can ensure them a safe and comfortable approach to tackling any issue,” Zabrodin explains. “The developed level of technology and know-how in Finland also means that more and more Russian businesses are or will be looking for joint ventures and technology acquisition. More and more Russian companies are also looking for public-private partnership projects in Finland. We can offer insight on both markets,” Zabrodin continues. CLS sees Finland as an important area for growth. The decision to come to Helsinki was made after discussions with Finnish lawyers and the investment promotion agency Helsinki Business Hub, who were very supportive of the idea. Capital Legal Services considers Finland a gateway to Russia for many international companies. “We received some good advice on taking the initial steps. After that, opening the office in Finland was quite straightforward. We have been lucky in the recruitment process and we managed to find very experienced, profound and result-oriented people [for the new office],” says Zabrodin. Capital Legal Services is setting an example by being the first Russian full service law firm to open office in Helsinki. At the first stage the firm will employ three people in Finland, but the aim is to grow in the coming years. Although as the capital and business centre of Finland Helsinki is natural starting point for the company, CLS is looking for opportunities in other cities as well. ”We hope the office will grow fast. Our idea is to offer another level of understanding of the Russian market, rather than to create competition for the local Finnish law firms. We will also be able to tackle the initial issues of Russian companies when they enter the Western market. We are going to cooperate with a number of Finnish law firms as different companies focus on different fields,” explains Vladislav Zabrodin. For the firm that has been working with international clients since its establishment in 1999, it is clear that building strong business relations is also important on a larger scale. ”We strongly believe that the only way to improve understanding and co-operation between Russia and Finland is by cultivating our economic relationship. Despite the current troubles, the economic co-operation needs to continue and this is the best way to improve the situation,” Zabrodin emphasises.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/hytest-takes-industry-lead/,HyTest takes industry lead,"Turku has grown into a centre of expertise for the Finnish biotech industry. One of the success stories is HyTest, a leading biotechnology company worldwide. The company, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary, has been a pioneer in cardiac markers, in particular. The Turku-based company produces monoclonal antibodies and antigens for use as raw materials in the diagnostics industry. Even though the terminology might sound complicated, the products made from these raw materials are quite familiar, according to  ’s director of sales and marketing,    . Our work benefits everyone who has ever been ill. “Our work benefits everyone who has ever been ill. We develop and supply raw materials for lab tests that are used, for example, in clinics to diagnose possible illnesses. One of the best-known is probably the CRP blood test, which tells a person with a cold whether their illness is caused by a bacterium or a virus.” Established in 1994, HyTest has gained a strong foothold in the diagnostics of cardiac diseases, in particular. The company is one of the world’s leading suppliers of Troponin I and I-T-C reagent suppliers. “During a heart attack, the body rapidly produces high levels of troponin, a protein found in the muscle structure, which can be detected by a lab test. Good diagnostics saves a lot of money thanks to early detection and appropriate treatment, especially in the case of diseases caused by the excesses of modern life.” Lehikoinen views diagnostics as a field of the future: heart disease is one of the fastest growing diagnostics areas, as populations are ageing and lifestyle diseases are increasing also in developing countries. Therefore, the sector faces fierce competition, according to Lehikoinen. “We have been at it for a long time, largely leading the way in the industry, so we have acquired solid expertise in research and development. We enjoy a good reputation worldwide: a small Finnish supplier, we have proven to be a reliable actor.” Instead of reveling in past glories, HyTest continuously focuses on enhancing its expertise and invests in product development. A good product is not enough – the whole palette, including delivery reliability, must be spot on. “Our position gives us an edge. Our customers will not easily switch their proven raw materials supplier, as lab tests must be approved by the national authorities. Switching suppliers is a long, hard and expensive process, and there must be weighty grounds for customers to embark on it,” Lehikoinen says. “This brings continuity to our operations. However, we must remember that our business is largely dependent on the resources available in the healthcare sector, and they are affected by the global economic situation. So far, we can look back on a solid and steady performance, with a growth rate exceeding the industry average.” The group turnover for the 14-month financial year ended last December was 15.4 million euros. The operations have always been international, with exports accounting for about 96 per cent. HyTest is doing business all over the world, in over 40 countries. The parent company is officially headquartered in Turku, but the company has locations in China and in Russia as well."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/bayer-relies-on-finnish-know-how/,Bayer relies on Finnish know-how,"The most successful product ever to have left pharmaceutical company Bayer’s production plant in Turku dates back almost a quarter of a century and is sold in more than 120 countries. The company’s newest product is expected to be Finland’s next success story. ’s roots lie in the pharmaceutical company Leiras, established in 1946. In 1996, Schering purchased Leiras and in 2006 Bayer acquired Schering. In addition to health-care solutions, the multi-sector company offers products geared towards agriculture and industry. “Using polymers in the long-term dosing of pharmaceuticals is the special expertise of our Finnish research and product development unit. It enables the even dosing of medication with increased precision. The technology allows us to create products that have a lifespan of up to several years,” says  , executive vice president of Bayer’s Turku production unit. Following its launch, more than 32 million of Bayer’s best-known product, the intrauterine device Mirena, have been sold. Last year, sales came close to 720 million euros, making it the company’s sixth best-selling prescription medication. Mirena is an exceptional product in that there are no similar competing products available on the markets. Annual investments in Turku’s global production facility have totalled some 10 million euros since 2007. The long-established production facility in Turku develops and manufactures products that are exported all over the world. Exports make up 98 per cent of the total production. “Having product development and production under the same roof is a fairly unique situation. New birth control and hormonal therapy products are being investigated and developed continuously. Annual investments in Turku’s global production facility have totalled some ten million euros since 2007,” says Essen. Another example of cutting-edge product development is a second intrauterine device, Jaydess. The product, which administers a low-hormonal dose, provides birth control for three years, while its “big sister” Mirena functions for five. Jaydess can also be used by women who have not given birth. The product, launched in the US markets last year, will arrive in Europe this year. According to Essen, the product has been well received and expectations are high. There are also big plans in store for the contraceptive implants manufactured in Turku. Jadelle, introduced in 1997, is implanted under the skin of the arm. Last year it received a significant boost when it was selected to participate in an international family planning project as part of Bayer’s Corporate Social Responsibility programme. “Our goal is to make long-acting contraceptives available to 27 million women living in the poorest countries by 2018. The project is estimated to prevent up to 30 million unwanted pregnancies,” Essen says."

The Turku-based high-tech companies Stick Tech and DelSiTech are following their own paths on the cutting edge of international development. The fibre technology developed by   enables, for example, the creation of fibre bridges to replace missing teeth, which benefits patients in a number of ways. Traditional treatments, such as ceramic bridges and implants, require several visits to the dentist and are more expensive than fibre bridges. “Our fibre-reinforced polymer filling material is as tough as dentin and twice as strong as traditional dental polymers. Compared to ceramic fillings, our material is clearly more cost-effective. The technology can also be used in tooth reconstruction following root canal treatment,” says Stick Tech CEO    . Stick Tech is ahead of its competitors. In January, the company’s fibre reinforcement was named the best innovation in the International Quality Innovation of the Year Competition. According to Kurokallio, being acknowledged for their long-term product development work motivates the company to launch new projects. Our fibre reinforcements are already being used in 30 countries worldwide. Around 90 per cent of our products go to global markets. “Our fibre reinforcements are already being used in 30 countries worldwide. Around 90 per cent of our products go to global markets. The co-operation between our company and the Department of Dentistry of the University of Turku is a unique combination of scientific materials research and clinical expertise, which gives us an edge over our competitors that we can continue to build on.” The future looks bright also for DelSiTech. Specialising in drug delivery technology, the fastest growing medical field, the company has operated globally from day one. The first product will enter the clinical study phase in about a year and operations are expected to grow rapidly over the next three years. ’s technology is based on the use of silicon dioxide i.e. silica in drug delivery. CEO     explains that silica is used to prepare an amorphous silica gel, which is then used to encapsulate drugs and various amounts of water, creating a favourable environment for biomolecules, such as proteins or therapeutic viruses, for example. “The technology may sound complicated, but it enables drugs to be administered accurately by subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, for example. The gel can also be made into small implants that are placed under the skin or in the target organ. The drug will then be released over the desired time, which can vary from a few days to several months.” Usually the target is to achieve long-term drug delivery to make the patient’s life easier. Daily injections or tablets can be replaced by just one injection administered every few months, for example. Injecting or implanting the drug into the tissue normally results in lower dose levels and reduces the side effects of medication. “Even though there are alternative technologies, silica gel is the only material that makes it possible to reliably release biomolecules and viruses,” Leino says."

Lumene has drawn on unique expertise to combine wild Arctic nature and Finnish berries with scientific innovations. “We have long-term experience in combining the active ingredients offered by wild Arctic nature with advanced science to create efficient skincare products. Our raw materials include, among other things, Finnish berries, such as the Arctic blueberry, Arctic cloudberry, Arctic lingonberry and fresh, pure spring water,” says  ’s president and CEO    “As our products are daily in contact with consumers’ skin, they have been proven to be safe, efficient and functional. We deliver on our promises and bring luxury into everyday life. All this is based on exceptionally strong and versatile expertise in chemistry and medicine, something many people may not realise.” Lumene is the first company in the world to have introduced stem cell technology derived from wild Arctic berries into skincare jointly with the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The raw material used for the stem cell preparation and the cosmetics line based on it is the Arctic cloudberry from Finland. “The stem cell technology derived from the Arctic cloudberry has been developed by VTT, and we have turned the raw material into an application suitable for the cosmetics industry and studied the efficiency and safety of the product,” says  , vice president of Lumene’s Innovation and Development department. According to Isohanni, the Arctic cloudberry stem cell preparation contains several natural antioxidants, such as flavanols, at a level approximately ten times higher than a fresh berry. Antioxidants protect the skin against external factors causing aging. The extract also enhances the skin’s elasticity. The product line based on the Arctic cloudberry has been well received worldwide. In Russia, for example, its Finnish origins are associated with reliability and safety. In the Asian markets, Lumene’s products have their place in a long tradition of natural skin care, which has its roots in Chinese medicine. One example of strong chemistry expertise is also the method developed jointly with Oulu University’s Sotkamo laboratory to isolate and refine into cosmetics the precious compounds found in the Arctic lingonberry. Tomorrow’s cosmetics will increasingly rely on biotechnology. “The lingonberry extract possesses characteristics that boost skin regeneration and help maintain the skin’s elasticity,” Isohanni says. “We are involved in utilising natural ingredients in many ways. Our product development thus has a strong link with biochemistry. In practice this means, for example, that we use microbes to refine a natural ingredient into new raw materials.

Its customer base consists mainly of small and medium-sized companies that use company cars, for example plumbing and construction services. ABAX’s equipment is developed in Norway and manufactured in Lithuania. “Our service is based on a subscription model that is extremely scalable, which means that our customers get both the equipment and the continuing service. Most of our competitors buy their equipment in China. We develop and manufacture our equipment, which guarantees tight integration and gives us control over the entire value chain,” says CEO Petter Quinsgaard from ABAX. ABAX’s Finnish office will – at least initially – concentrate on sales and marketing and it will serve the entire country. Opened in March, the office already has eight employees. “We aim to be first and foremost a Nordic company. As we already had offices in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, Finland was the next logical location,” says Håkon Grønn-Weiss, head of the new Finnish office. ABAX started planning the new office before Christmas. It received help from Invest in Finland and has also relied on the support of recruiting and communications firms as well as tax and advisory services. “Launching an office in Finland was actually easier than launching offices in other Nordic countries. We have been warmly welcomed in Vantaa and Finland. Regulation here is similar to other Scandinavian countries, as are customer needs. The infrastructure is very good and all services are readily available,” said Grønn-Weiss. Quinsgaard and Grønn-Weiss say that the goal of ABAX’s Finnish office is to be the best provider of triplog and vehicle tracking services and to gain a couple of thousand customers in the next two or three years. The company plans to recruit 18 employees in Finland by August and 30–35 employees in the next couple of years. They are currently recruiting. “Our number one goal, however, are happy employees. Our number two goal follows directly from that: happy customers. We don’t give our employees sales goals; we let them set their own goals. When they are happy, they commit and stay with us and achieve good results. Enthusiasm is the key,” says Quinsgaard. While many other companies are limping through the recession, ABAX leaps forward. “ABAX has grown in spite of the European economic crisis because we help customers cut costs and reduce expensive and unnecessary manual labor.

Municipal water treatment has been the backbone of Kemira’s business for about 50 years. In general, Kemira focuses on pulp and paper, oil and gas, mining and water treatment. “At  ’s Municipal and Industrial segment, our main products are aluminum and iron salts that are used as coagulants in various applications. Polymers, which are also used in water treatment, are another important production line for us,” says sales manager  . “In everyday life, coagulants and polymers can be seen in the results of drinking and waste water treatment. Our products and solutions thus play a significant role in guaranteeing that we get clean water from the tap and in treating waste waters in accordance with the strict requirements in force. The cleaning of lakes, on the other hand, improves their recreational use from the consumer’s perspective.” Kemira provides expertise and tailored combinations of chemicals for water-intensive industries. The company’s vision is to provide the most valuable expertise and chemicals for water-intensive industries. Technological products and expertise have been the key in making the company a leading provider in the field of drinking water treatment. “When drinking water, not many people think about how important the chemical treatment of raw water is for the drinking water production process. Our expertise in this area is a great asset,” explains Kettunen. Raw water is always different and contains varying amounts of degradable organic matter, algae, bacteria, viruses and sand or clay particles. The water’s pH, or acidity, level also varies. “Our range of coagulants enables the best treatment result at the lowest possible cost. The chemical solutions designed for the treatment of drinking water improve the quality of the finished water while also adding a number of advantages to the process.” The development of water treatment requires extensive long-term effort. The latest innovation resulting from Kemira’s R&D efforts, the DesinFix disinfection technology, meets the needs of both water recycling and the reuse of purified waste water. “DesinFix is based on a mixture of two chemicals, formic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which, ultimately, efficiently kills bacteria. Water disinfection only takes a few minutes and the process is safe, without any by-products,” explains Kettunen. “This innovation represents unique expertise. It includes the chemicals, the equipment and the related services and it is used, among other things, for agricultural and landscape irrigation as well as for bathing waters and other recreational applications. Water recycling, on the other hand, saves water and the environment.”"

This development will gain momentum thanks to the bioeconomy strategy announced in May to increase the yield of Finland’s bioeconomy to 100 billion euros by 2025 and create 100 000 new jobs. The   is part of the green economy. Its focus is on biological resources which are managed and used sustainably to produce goods, energy, food and services. The bioeconomy makes use of cleantech, that is to say clean technologies, and abides by the principle of the circular economy: “One person’s waste is another person’s resource”. “The targets are ambitious, but realistic. We have long traditions and wide-ranging expertise in the field”, says Doctor of Technology   from the  . The strategy is a decision-in-principle that is binding “regardless of changes of government and prime minister.” “Finland possesses the EU’s largest and the world’s fourth largest natural resources, in other words, reserves of biomass per capita, as well as top expertise in chemistry and biotechnology, among other fields, for making use of them. We had strong expertise even before people started talking about the bioeconomy.” Pohjakallio refers to  , the Finnish chemist who received Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the AIV fodder preservation method and already back in the 1930s believed in the business opportunities of biochemistry and chemistry. According to Pohjakallio, Virtanen also understood that innovations are often generated at industry intersections. “The smart and sustainable utilisation of biomass is impossible without chemistry expertise. Various chemical industry companies are involved in the biomass cycle from the manufacture of fertilisers needed for biomass cultivation all the way through to refining biowaste. Clean water is also linked to the bioeconomy, and in water chemistry,  we are one of the top countries worldwide,” Pohjakallio says. “Forest, food and energy industry companies are also important players in the bioeconomy. Broad-based co-operation is the most efficient way to develop the bioeconomy, and we as a small country have the agility it requires. What we need now is even greater involvement of SMEs.” Neste Oil is among the Finnish companies that have carried out investments to advance the bioeconomy. Neste Oil’s President and CEO   at the inauguration of the company’s pilot plant for producing microbial oil. One example that bears testimony to Finland’s early bioeconomy expertise is the various tall oil-based chemicals produced in the country since the 1940s. Another good example is xylitol, a sugar derived from birch and used as a sweetener. Its industrial-scale production got started in Finland in the 1970s. “With the new wave, the proportion of bio-raw materials in chemical products will increase further. Vegetable oil-based raw materials are increasingly being used in paints, glues and rubber products, for example. In medicine, too, biotechnology is growing at a fast pace,” Pohjakallio says. Today, more than a third of Finland’s chemical industry companies already use bio-based raw materials. The number one export product is renewable diesel manufactured mainly from waste oil, but that is just one example of the many bio-based best-sellers. A number of investments are also being planned in the industry to advance the bioeconomy. Among the examples of chemical industry investments in Finland, Pohjakallio cites Forchem, Neste Oil, Roal, St1 Biofuels and Berner. “The bioeconomy currently accounts for around 16 per cent of the Finnish economy. According to forecasts, its proportion will increase to 50 per cent by 2040. Current focal areas in chemical industry companies include the utilisation of by-product flows and waste, the renewal of the raw materials base, the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency.” The bioeconomy is quickly imposing itself in a world where competition for raw materials is getting tougher and tougher. In 2030, the world’s population is expected to reach 9 billion, which means that 50 per cent more food, 45 per cent more energy and 30 per cent more water will be needed compared to now."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/reagena-launches-rapid-test-for-tick-borne-encephalitis/,Reagena launches rapid test for tick-borne encephalitis,"The Finnish company Reagena has brought to the market a record-fast rapid test for the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE).The test gives, within approximately 20 minutes, an almost 100 per cent accurate result. Intended for professional use, the test addresses a growing demand. TBE is a tick-borne viral infection which is also known as Kumlinge disease. In Finland, the disease has previously mainly been detected in the Turku archipelago, but its area of occurrence is expanding. In Sweden, ten times the number of cases are reported than in Finland while the corresponding figures in Russia are 1 000-fold compared with Finland. The disease is also found elsewhere in Europe and in parts of Asia. “TBE is less common than Lyme disease, which is another tick-borne disease, but it is also more difficult to test and diagnose. The TBE rapid test that we have developed is so far the only one and the fastest in the world,” says  ’s CEO    . The product, which is a result of a few years of development, brings new dimensions to testing. In Finland, traditional laboratory tests have, until today, only been performed in the central laboratories of major hospitals, from where the tests have been forwarded for analysis. This process has slowed down the detection and exclusion of the disease and delayed the start of further treatment for the patient. “The rapid test is not only fast, but it is also easy to use. The test can be performed with a just drop of blood in a local laboratory and the result is ready in about 20 minutes, which means it saves considerable amounts of time and other resources,” says Parviainen. The test was launched on the market during spring. The market is large and growing, as zoonotic infections are expected to spread as a result of climate change, among other factors. Currently, the rapid test is being exported to the Nordic countries and Europe. Inquiries have been pouring in from Russia as well, but the local product registration process takes its time. The rapid test for the detection of TBE complements Reagena’s product family focusing on the diagnosis of zoonotic infectious diseases. Founded in 1987, the company launched a rapid test for Puumala virus infections already more than ten years ago. Its success is based on strong chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology expertise, among other things. “In addition to our own brand, we manufacture various reagents and solutions for industrial customers operating in the hospital and life science sectors. We thus also work closely with a more traditional field of chemical industry, although a highly specialised one,” Parviainen says. Around 35–40 per cent of the company’s production is exported. Future growth will be focused on products that are already in the R&D pipeline. Although Parviainen cannot go into more detail about them, it is clear that expert know-how will be in high demand. The company is confident in its future, as there is no end in sight for the steady growth witnessed over many years."

Helsinki-based Boomlagoon has announced its second game after a major new funding from European investors. It has been a good month for  . The Finnish mobile game developer closed a successful 3.6 million-US dollar (2.6 million euros) funding round in early May adding European investors Northzone, Inventure and 360 Capital Partners. They join existing investors London Venture Partners and Jari Ovaskainen, who also participated in the new round. The fresh funding has helped Boomlagoon focus on developing new games and accelerating recruitment. The company wants to add two developers in Helsinki to its international team of 10 employees and plans are already in place for further expansion as the company grows. Following the investment news Boomlagoon has revealed its second game,  , which will launch later this summer.   is eagerly anticipated after the company’s debut title,  , was downloaded more than two million times within its first few months. This success also saw Boomlagoon listed amongst Red Herring’s Top 100 most promising technology companies in Europe. Not bad going by ex-Rovio and   developers   and   who founded Boomlagoon in 2012. “With  , we’ve created a platform that is easy to pick up and play, instantly rewards the gamer, and still provides nearly infinite ways to progress through the environments,” says company CEO Stén.  is a hybrid of platform action and collectible card games. Boomlagoon promises it will feature dozens of characters and a rich storyline. In the game, players will battle their way through waves of adversaries and collect magical powers as they aim to retrieve  ’s stolen treasure. It’s these kinds of character-driven mobile games that Boomlagoon sees as a key differentiator for the company. In Boomlagoon’s second game, which comes out later in the summer, players embark on a mystical journey to retrieve a stolen treasure. “Character-driven is a game genre that hasn’t been seen much in the mobile gaming side and we have strong expertise in it. We are surrounding our characters with truly compelling worlds and storytelling which brings depth and quality into our games. This is fairly unique in mobile gaming,” Stén explains. Looking at the bigger picture, Stén says that while receiving acclaim from the likes of Red Herring has been valuable in building a brand and getting visibility, the focus is on developing the best possible products and games that drives the company. “It’s part of Finnish integrity that everything is done well and finished properly,” Stén jokes. “I told someone that Finns’ always have somewhat boring presentations as we don’t know how to present. But because of this we have to make great products.” He also identifies the culture of gaming companies within Finland as part of Boomlagoon’s success. “Finland has a long history of gaming companies,” Stén continues. “This has created a tight community where there isn’t fierce competition, rather we all pull together. We can talk with other gaming companies and tackle challenges together. This is something that is rare elsewhere.” Following the success of Rovio and Supercell, it is a good time to be a Finnish gaming company and Boomlagoon is making a strong claim to be the next global brand."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/global-demand-for-rye-products-on-the-rise/,Global demand for rye products on the rise,"Alongside the traditional Finnish rye bread, new products are hitting the market at an increasing rate. Linkosuo’s crispy rye products, for example, are garnering interest in a number of countries. According to    , managing director of the nearly 80-year-old   bakery, product development is the company’s greatest asset. “We have a long tradition in processing the sourdough starter. It is our professional pride and our secret that we pass on continually from masters to apprentices as tacit knowledge. As there is plenty of demand for rye products in Finland, it has been natural for us to develop them. Today, some 80 per cent of our turnover comes from rye products.” “Sales of crispy rye snacks increased around 20 per cent last year. The trend seems to be continuing more or less on the same path this year,” says Linkosuo’s managing director Timo Jänne. Rye products have always been familiar to Finns, but in recent years their popularity has reached an all-time high. The health effects of rye have been studied for a long time, and consumers are also showing growing interest in them. The health benefits of rye have prompted Linkosuo to develop new kinds of products. The highly popular rye crisps are one example of healthy snacks appreciated by today’s health-conscious consumers. Rye crisps have indeed attracted a new type of clientele to the rye products shelves. “Rye snacks are a trendy version of the traditional rye bread that can be snacked on as such directly from the bag or enjoyed with various toppings. We launched the rye crisps in 2010, and their success has surprised even us,” Jänne says with a smile. Rye fever has been steadily gaining ground outside of Finland too. According to Jänne, around 10 per cent of the snack products are exported, and the proportion is growing. At the moment, demand is strongest in Russia, Estonia, Denmark, Germany and the UK. In the autumn, exports will be started to Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden, among other countries. “We are constantly looking for new opportunities,” Jänne says. “Preliminary inquires have been made in China, for example.” “Growth potential exists in neighbouring markets, but we also see horizons that might seem surprising from Finland’s perspective. We will, for example, start exporting organic rye crisps to Taiwan this summer. People are drawn to what is healthy, natural and easy,” Jänne points out. In order to meet growing demand, Linkosuo last year invested more than four million euros in a new oven line and packaging plant. According to Jänne, competition is fierce, but at the same time energising. “We are paving the way. Our intention is to constantly be ahead of the others. We try out surprising combinations and products for different situations. What the market wants next might be, say, rye sweets,” Jänne hints."

She would have liked to see mothers all over the world receive such a gift. That is how Sanna Belitz, a former product developer at Nokia, came to establish the startup company Almondella that solves problems for new parents. “Every company is changing the world in some way. Our core values are ecological and sustainable products that don’t fall apart immediately as often happens with mass-produced products.” Almondella’s service, developed from a pedagogical perspective that takes into account the child’s needs, is unique in the world. The box that Almondella sends each month includes a piece of clothing, a toy suitable for the child’s developmental stage, a dish or a book and cosmetics products for the parent or baby. Each box also contains suggestions and advice for what to do with the things in the box. The objective of the suggestions is to activate the family to do things together."

All the user needs to do is to slip an electronic sensor band around their water bottle and monitor their smartphone to see when it is time to take a sip. The startup company   employs four young Finns who run their US-registered business out of Helsinki. That is a strange equation, as the majority of startups do just the opposite: start in Finland and expand to the US markets. “Our idea was accepted in a business accelerator programme in New Jersey in spring 2013,” says Caktus CEO  . “That secured us seed funding from American angel investors, which is exceptional in that Americans rarely invest in startups with a foreign background. That prompted us to register our company there.” According to Keski-Pukkila, Finland is a great place for the company’s product development, among other things, and Caktus might be interested in doing business in Finland’s growing health technology sector in the future. But first, the business needs to get rolling. Caktus’s newly released product –   – includes a sensor band to be slipped around a water bottle and a mobile app running on iOS. Caktus’s first product – The Hug – includes an electronic sensor and a mobile app. “The app monitors water intake and keeps the user informed about their hydration level. The idea came simply from my own experience: I did a lot of sports and never drank enough water,” Keski-Pukkila sums up. Established in spring 2013, the company is currently launching operations through a crowdfunding campaign where the customer orders the product and pays for it in advance. The company’s intention is to use the funds raised to supply the first products to its first customers by the end of the year. “Our dream is to co-operate with a global beverage industry giant. We are advocates of the health benefits of water, and we would like to encourage them to take their operations in a healthier direction,” says Keski-Pukkila. “The sugary drink trend that is popular among Americans in particular is a major risk for public health, but a gradual shift is already taking place,” Keski-Pukkila envisions."

A patent is being sought for the technology in Finland, the European Union, the United States as well as Japan and China. “Inspecting the quality of mirror-finish and glossy products, such as tableware, bathroom mixer taps or pots and pans, is challenging due to their high light reflectance. Traditionally, this job has mainly been performed manually, but as you can imagine, it is not an easy task for the human eye either,” explains  ’s CEO  . The machine vision technology developed by Helmee is intended for use in the quality control of these multifaceted mirror-finish products. Quality control is required in many sectors, and Helmee’s plan is to manufacture machine vision systems for customers operating in a variety of industries. The first market segment targeted by the company is tableware manufacturers, followed by automotive subcontractors, for example. Helmee’s innovative machine vision system is based on technology developed at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The company was established last autumn to commercialise and develop this product idea. Helmee was started up with the founders’ own capital and funding from VTT Ventures and one angel investor. Currently, Helmee is involved in a product development project funded by Tekes. An operational machine vision system already exists, although there is still room for improvement. “The pilot system will be tested in Germany this year. Going forward, I would think that the majority of our customers will be operating outside Finland. We are currently applying for a patent in Finland, the EU area, the United States, Japan and China – we also aim to enter these markets,” Saarinen says. The probability of success is high, as the company is not aware of the existence of a similar product elsewhere in the world.

It assists event planners in finding a suitable location for parties and meetings, for example. Behind the scenes at Venuu is a young and enthusiastic eight-person team. A few years ago, two students,   and  , organised lunchtime discos at Aalto University to which they invited their fellow students to dance for an hour in the middle of the day. “We often had trouble finding a suitable venue for the disco. We noticed that the same problem exists on a larger scale: finding any type of venue through online searches and contacting people about them was a slow and tedious process,” Koponen says. In April 2013, the pair decided to establish a website to address the problem. The result was  , which functions as a link between the venue and the person looking for one. Koponen describes the service as the Airbnb of event planning, where people can tailor their searches according to their needs and also discover less visible venues. Today, Venuu’s roster includes close to 700 venues mainly in the Helsinki and Turku area. New locations are sought constantly and Koponen also has his sights set on the global markets – maybe even later this year. “So far our focus is still on Finland. Our goal is to create a service platform so good that it can be adapted to almost any country or city. Our vision is to make Venuu a more extensive global service,” says Koponen. According to him, foreign investors have already given the Venuu concept the green light in preliminary negotiations.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/yepzon-promises-world-s-easiest-child-positioning-device/,Yepzon promises world’s easiest child positioning device,"About a year ago, Otto Linna and his friends were contemplating what smart clothing really means. During their discussions, they came up with the idea of an easy-to-use child positioning technology that could be attached to clothing – and thus Yepzon was born. “During the development phase, we gave clothing equipped with the positioning solution to several families to test out. Half of the testers felt that the device should be separate. The other half, however, wished to see a positioning device integrated in the clothing,” explains Linna, who is nowadays CEO of the Tampere-based company. “So we decided to make a version that suits both sides: a small device that could be affixed to the lining of clothing, but which could also be carried, for example, on a key chain or in one’s pocket.” Yepzon’s CEO Otto Linna. The final   positioner is a small and lightweight device that resembles a key chain. It has no buttons on it. The Yepzon is turned on using a mobile phone app and has a battery life of several months. Pre-launch marketing of the product began in June, and the target markets of Russia, Europe and the United States have already been reached to some extent. “We have already received quite a lot of orders. Most are from Finland, but some orders have also been placed from Russia, Germany and the UK. Negotiations have recently begun in the US. The device costs around 100 euros in Finland, but the price will come down over the next few years as production volumes grow,” says Linna. “Children go missing in the US. at an alarming rate: one every 40 seconds. Technology related to child safety is also quite commonly used there. In Europe, England is the country that uses this kind of technology the most.” The Yepzon device works on almost all smartphones. The company makes a bold promise: it offers the world’s easiest-to-use and safest child positioning device. “We have tested new devices, and most of them require user registration. Yepzon is ready to use right after it has been paired with the user’s smart phone. Personal information is not required, so if the device is stolen, for example, you don’t have to worry about it falling into the wrong hands.” According to Linna, the market for positioning devices in everyday products is still unstructured, but use of the services is clearly on the rise. In cars, for example, navigators are already commonplace. And Yepzon does not intend to rest on just one application: “The company’s idea initially was to develop technology that could be integrated with anything, so more applications are in the pipeline. For example, we have been contacted by boating enthusiasts, because boats tend to drift away and are a prime target for theft. Children’s clothing already equipped with a positioning device is also being planned.” Yepzon’s positioner."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/naturvention-combats-bad-indoor-air/,Naturvention combats bad indoor air,"A few years ago, students Aki Soudunsaari and Niko Järvinen met each other at an innovation course at the University of Jyväskylä. They came up with the idea of purifying indoor air using plants. The development of active plant walls was started up jointly with experts, and in 2011, the startup company   was established to commercialise the invention. Currently, the company employs 12 people. Järvinen is responsible for product development and Soudunsaari for the strategy. “The idea of the active plant wall – Fresh Wall – developed by us is to circulate indoor air through the root zone in the plant wall. At the same time, the fans located in the top part of the wall blow clean air back into the room. The Fresh Wall can also be used to optimise indoor air humidity by controlling water evaporation, for example,” Järvinen explains. According to him, the FreshWall purifies indoor air more than a hundred times more efficiently than a single houseplant. Various plant walls exist in the world, but only NaturVention holds an international patent for the active plant wall. Naturvention’s main product is the Fresh Wall. They are currently used mainly in offices and public buildings. Several similar products and Fresh Walls of different sizes are being planned to meet the various needs of customers in the future. The company’s innovation has already been exported outside Finland: there are dozens of FreshWalls in Russia, and exports to other countries are kicking off. Discussions have mostly been conducted in Sweden, Germany, Singapore, India and China. “Our product offers an alternative to unhealthy indoor air, which is a global issue.  We are able to provide a natural solution, be the problem mould, chemicals or air pollutants that are carried indoors,” Soudunsaari says. The goal is to have Fresh Walls featured in private homes in the future. “Our vision is that by 2020, each and every major city in the world will have in place solutions based on our technology.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-fashion-stands-out-in-berlin-in-a-good-way/,Finnish fashion stands out in Berlin in a good way,"Berlin’s Brunnenstrasse street is hot and happening. Berlin Fashion Week is in full swing, and the showroom and pop-up shop #INLAND set up by eight Finnish designers is drawing a lot of attention from passers-by. The shop is run by a world-class team of Finnish designers who are now reaching for international markets. The concept is the brainchild of two promising Finnish designers –  , who currently resides in Berlin, and  , founder of the   brand. The designers joined forces back in their university days, and their collaboration continued in Helsinki with a store promoting Finnish design. Both women now have their sights set firmly on the German market. “Finnish design is, indeed, our trump card. Everything in our shop is from Finland, right down to the furniture, and when people walk in, they can see right away that we have a clear concept,” says Metsola. From day one,   and Riivari have been honing the shop’s concept to make it easy for Finnish companies to participate in the project. In the shop, visitors can sit in an Artek chair, buy Finnish music from the Stupido Records label, experience Berlin’s bicycle paths on a Pelago bike, and fill their tummies with Fazer chocolate. “The extent of our offering has inspired companies to join us. The #INLAND brands cover men’s clothing, footwear, street fashion, as well as more relaxed – and more rocking styles. The designs also show that Finnish design is entirely different from, for example, Swedish design, which still leans on the safe black & white colour palette,” Riivari points out. Designer Terhi Pölkki’s shoes are made in Finland. Buyers and even customers have taken note of this fact and have expressed their surprise at the exotic and bold Finnish vision compared to other Scandinavian design. The advantage of teaming up is that it opens up wider international exposure. With the products of eight Finnish designers all under one roof, it’s no wonder the shop is so busy. The shop’s offering includes select brands that are generally in the same situation right now and have similar plans going forward. The efforts to establish the showroom and pop-up shop also involved battling some red tape, and the project would not have been possible if Metsola hadn’t been living in Berlin. They learned a lot from this concept launch, and the notion of taking it to Paris or New York Fashion Week no longer sounds so impossible. If you ask the designers what they think is the best way for a Finnish fashion company to enter global markets, they praise the success of their concept: “I think this is the best way to do it. Definitely! And with a team where everyone supports one another. It makes no sense to go it alone,” say Riivari and Metsola in unison. #INLAND also rents Finnish Pelago bikes to its customers. #INLAND will continue to showcase Finnish design in Berlin until the end of August at the address Brunnenstrasse 11."

Finnish architecture group Komitu’s new youth centre was completed in Phnom Penh in Cambodia in early 2014. Now it has been awarded with an honourable mention at the Rethinking Future Awards architecture competition.  and   are young architects and students from Aalto University, and form the   group. During their studies, all members of the group participated a public building planning course, which included a field work component in Cambodia. ”The decision to design the youth centre started when we became familiarized with Cambodian Volunteers for the Society (CVS) and Khmer Kamputchea Krom Human Rights Association (KKKHRDA), our partners,” explains Tenho. “They want to make youth more active in their daily lives and in society. Majority of the Cambodian population is under 30 years old due to the country’s violent recent history. Possibilities for education and employment are scarce and many young people are drawn to violence and drugs.” The awarded youth centre is an interpretation of a Cambodian house, suited for the tropical climate, paired with the architects’ cultural backgrounds. The construction of the centre took two years to complete due to uncertainty with funding and a change of a contractor. The building was finished in February 2014. Funding for the project was completely acquired from Finland. The members of Komitu are joined by a strong ethical sense of responsibility and the belief in the strength of architecture as a reliever of poverty. The project’s themes are environmentally friendly and innovative solutions. The architects have used natural low carbon materials, such as bamboo, compressed earth blocks and even bottles filled with plastic waste. Considering the climate, rain water harvesting was also installed in the building. The garden has also a bigger meaning: providing protection from the sun and serving as a teaching space for efficient farming classes. The architects wanted to design the building with natural ventilation, working through air pressure and gravity. The roof and walls are also painted light-coloured in order to reflect heat. ”Cambodians reacted differently to the materials previously unknown to them. The building’s walls were previously planned to be completely made out of compacted earth blocks, but lab tests showed weaknesses in their strength. We decided to add a cement framework, which seemed to make the locals satisfied, as it is a known construction technique for them.” Komitu kept their partner organizations’ young people involved since the planning phase of the building. The centre’s spaces and their functions were planned in co-operation with the local youth. “The building’s first plans were presented to young people, who then gave us valuable feedback about the culture and climate of the region. They paid surprisingly little attention to the appearance of the building, but rather focused on its safety.” At the moment the building is being used for giving English classes to children and youngsters, with plans being drawn for IT classes for next autumn. The organisations have also planned a voluntary hospital run by medicine students, as well as accommodation for young girls moving in from rural areas into the city to study. Plastic bottles filled with plastic waste were used to build walls. The aim of the project was to inspire locals through the new construction techniques used in the centre. The Komitu group collaborated with local experts and universities, by giving a presentation on current bamboo-building techniques and presenting their plans at the architecture school. ”We wanted to remind Cambodians how amazing building material bamboo is. It has been a traditional construction material but it has been forgotten with the arrival of new materials.” The local residents and students were inspired by the Finns’ building. One engineering student made his thesis work about bamboo construction, and a group following the project has already built a house using bamboo and compacted earth blocks. The locals have also been constructing fences using the plastic bottle building technique from the youth centre. The building has received critical acclaim in several architecture magazines and blogs around the world. The aim of the project was to inspire locals through the new construction techniques used in the centre."

Droplet Hitech Design, from Oulu in northern Finland, manufacturer of the   phone skins and covers, started out in 2011 when nature-loving friends   and   noticed that most of the mobile device accessories on the market were mass-produced, synthetic products. “The fact is, the market is 95 per cent dominated by the Chinese. They do make wooden phone skins in the US, but we figured that in Finland they could certainly be made from Finnish wood as well,” says Arffman, CEO of the company. The business idea was to make covers for mobile devices from renewable materials, mainly wood. The company uses only Finnish wood from a total of six species. The range on offer covers most of the popular brands, particularly the Finnish Jolla, as the companies have an agreement on co-operation. Founders of Droplet Hitech Design, Sakari Arffman (left) and Jussi Patopuro. “The most popular type of wood is Curly Birch, which appeals especially to Finns and Swedes. Grey-dyed birch, which we call Kelo, has also sold really well. A wide variety of colours is something we want to keep.” The products are hand-made in Finland. “The covers are made by pressing a piece of veneer, a thin sheet of timber, onto canvas at a temperature of 300 degrees Celsius, after which the product is sanded by hand. There are seven processing stages. The finished product provides a good grip and doesn’t slip out of your hand easily,” Arffman continues. The sales success makes a difference in Zambia, as each Lastu product sold includes a five-euro donation to a Zambian tree planting project. In practice this means that for every three Lastu products sold, a tree is planted and benefits Zambian people. According to Arffman, the company has few competitors in Europe but no one else uses Finnish wood for mobile covers. No wonder that net sales have grown steadily: from 65 000 euros in 2012 to approximately 130 000 euros in 2013. This year’s preliminary figures indicate up to tripled sales compared with 2013. Lastu covers are hand-made in Finland from Finnish wood. (Photo: Droplet Hitech Design) The 23 countries on the sales list include Scandinavia, Belgium and Germany. “What makes us particularly happy is that our products have attracted buyers from all age groups. Depending on the season, monthly sales range between 200 and 1 000 covers.” “Our next target is the UK. There was interest in Dubai as well, but they requested such a large batch that we were not able to deliver. Production capacity is still insufficient at the moment.” The company has aimed at the export market right from the start and a significant milestone was reached recently. “Last spring, our foreign sales exceeded domestic sales, so we’re officially an export business now. We established our company without government support, which is fairly rare in Finland. We have progressed one step at a time, relying on our sales income only.”"

Kreminsky also praised the mentoring and access to contacts which Finnish accelerator and early stage investor   provides. On a recent visit to the Finnish capital, for example, he had found it easy to get in touch with small research companies, municipality workers and university marketing heads. ”Every business is a social endeavor and you have to interact with other people,” he said. “With Helsinki Ventures, everyone is just a phone call away.” “We also hope to get financing from Helsinki and the business acceleration programme run by Helsinki Ventures makes it more likely.” My City envisages job creation in Helsinki, depending on financing and how fast the company can grow. Since the idea was founded in the Russian city of Murmansk, 13 cities in three countries have joined the platform, which its founders believe has worldwide appeal and relevance. ”Our audience is closely related to a specific location,” says Kreminsky. My City envisages job creation in Helsinki, depending on financing and how fast the company can grow. “It is about people publishing information about the places where they live, where they work, where their kids go to school. In that sense, it is pretty global regardless of any culture.” That view is shared by  , partner at Helsinki Ventures, which focuses on Russia, Eastern Europe and CIS countries and helps companies develop products, commercialise them and take them to global markets. “Russia is renowned for its academia, academic research and technological innovation,” Everi says. “However people aren’t accustomed to buying Russian brands.” Kreminsky says experience so far has shown his team that the ideal population of a My City community ranges from 50 000 to one million. ”We are not looking at huge places like Moscow or St Petersburg or London or New York City but smaller places, which don’t necessary have the resources for building a feedback collection or citizen engagement platform.” ”Every moderate-sized city could use this system for the benefit of everyone living in it, be it municipalities, be it small businesses, be it residents.” My City is looking at options of up to a quarter of a million euros of funding. Depending on its success, it will explore ways to develop the platform and offer more ways of engaging people. ”At the moment we provide an interface for a person to post a marker on the map and provide a suggestion what can be improved in this specific location.  We are also expanding the technology so that more elaborate surveys could be published online. For instance, pre-defined locations could receive comments or other kinds of discussions.” Kreminsky suggests that My City has wide-ranging implications for the democratic process. ”Right now, we have a delegation-based model for democracy where people elect certain officials and then they represent the people. It doesn’t always have to be this way because the technology allows people to provide direct engagement in decision-making.” Editor’s note: This article is published in cooperation with  and"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/russian-startup-taist-expands-to-helsinki/,Russian startup Taist expands to Helsinki,"The reputation of Helsinki as the startup capital of Northern Europe hasn’t gone unnoticed in Russia. Moscow-based startup Taist is opening an office in Helsinki to access the Finnish cloud software market and to prepare for international expansion. Taist offers cloud software vendors a service to open up their software to third parties to build applications. This added level of customisation enables the software to better suit individual customer needs. ”Think of the iPhone. When it was first introduced, it didn’t offer any external apps. Apple later opened up the app store for third party developers to create apps to meet the needs of different users. We offer a similar solution to cloud software vendors who can turn their products into extendable platforms,” describes  , founder of Taist. Helsinki is seen as a gateway to wider European markets and the US for the Russian companies. Taist’s service will allow third parties to expand the vendor’s software to meet the specific needs of different customers, without the vendor having to spend money and time to customise the software. The mature market of cloud software vendors and the level of software expertise attracted Taist to Helsinki, where its operations began in June. Helsinki is also seen as a gateway to wider European markets and the US for the Russian companies. ”There is more demand for our service here than in Russia where the market is still young. I was surprised how easy it is to get access to top level management in Helsinki. That wouldn’t be possible in Russia. The first customer negotiations have already started,” says Belousov. Founded in 2013, Taist has largely been a one man project. Belousov is now looking for developers in Moscow while the business operations of the company will be run from Helsinki. ”My plan is to focus on growing the office in Helsinki and during the next two years hire both developers and business people here. I hope to build a big, successful company, ”Belousov explains. At the moment the early developer version of Taist is used by 50 companies in Russia and Belousov says the first pilot project with a major cloud software vendor is underway. Once the pilot has been completed Taist will focus on further developing its service for internationalisation with Finnish customers. These plans are supported by Helsinki Ventures, an accelerator and early stage investor, whose startup programme convinced Belousov to come to Helsinki in the first place. The accelerator sees great value in attracting foreign startups to Finland. Taist offers cloud software vendors a service to open up their software to third parties to build applications. ”Successful startups coming from Finland, like Rovio and Supercell, don’t just employ and help the economy locally. They also help to build Finland into an attractive and well-known startup centre, ” explains  , partner and chairman at Helsinki Ventures. Taist might be a small player now but in targeting the global multi-billion market of cloud services, the potential is virtually limitless. First Taist will focus on Finland and then build international operations starting from other Nordic countries and the Baltics. ”My aim is to build a service that is used by the whole cloud industry globally. At the moment we are targeting mature cloud software vendors but in the future I want to see all new vendors using Taist from the start,” Belousov adds.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/london-loves-finnish-cinnamon-buns/,London loves Finnish cinnamon buns,"More than seven years ago, the Finnish company Nordic Bakery brought a piece of Finland to London and introduced Londoners to cinnamon buns, Karelian pies, dark rye bread and coffee. Believing in simplicity, the brand has held its own and proven its appeal. The man behind the idea of establishing a Nordic café in London is    , former professional hockey player and cultural secretary at The Finnish Institute in London for many years. He thought: Why not bring Nordic design to the spotlight also in the form of coffee and Scandinavian delicacies? The first   opened its doors in 2007 at Golden Square in Soho, and since then the streets of London have been awaft with the scent of freshly baked cinnamon buns and dark-roasted coffee. A few years later, new locations were opened at New Cavendish Street and Dorset Street. The cinnamon bun is a favourite in London too. “We serve typical Nordic café products to international, urban consumers. The buns don’t necessarily taste like the ones your grandma made; instead, ours are a modern take on the traditional version,” says    “Cinnamon buns are our biggest sellers. It is like an iconic product that people admire, photograph and share in social media.” Cold-smoked salmon and cured salmon on dark rye bread have been on the menu from the get-go. Today, the traditional egg and herring sandwich is also popular. Karelian pies with or without egg-butter spread are also in the top five, as are the juicy Tosca cake and the rustic oatmeal cookies. Over the years, some items have been added to the menu while others have been discontinued. The hearty lunch salads launched in June represent the latest novelties. Consistently high-quality coffee has also been one of the café’s cornerstones. “Cinnamon buns are our biggest sellers,” says Miisa Mink. Nordic Bakery embraces rustic simplicity. The products are served on Arabia’s Teema tableware, and the furniture has been designed by Alvar Aalto and Ilmari Tapiovaara. The walls are bare wood. This is a place free of the noisy clamor of TV and radio. “We stand out as a timeless, stripped-back version. We are picky in what we include in our concept, which has become more and more simple over the years. However, far from being clinical, our minimalism comes with a certain dark undertone of Nordic excitement,” Mink says. Although the café has evolved into a tourist attraction, its objective is not to be a tourist office. Nowadays, Nordic Bakery is featured in all the London guide books, and it attracts not only the locals, but also tourists from all over the world. Asian people are particularly delighted with it. In 2012, the company expanded operations from London to the Frankfurt airport, but there the concept failed to take off. According to Mink, the company does aim to expand its operations, but prefers to do so in a controlled manner, staying true to the brand."

Established in Milan in 1998, Celly Spa has grown into a global company, whose mobile accessories are sold in over 85 countries and has subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Switzerland and now in Finland. Good connections and established market presence helped Celly to make the decision to open its office in Helsinki. ”Celly already has a good market presence, existing distribution channels and retail chain in Finland. It’s a good place to start as our brand is well known,” explains Celly Nordic’s country manager in Finland  . “Finland is close to other Nordic countries and Russia so it’s a very good location logistically. We have been to Finland many times over the years so we know the market well and have good contacts here.” Celly Spa sells its products through hypermarkets, telecom operators and distributors, amongst others. In Finland the company is also interested in cooperation with the fashion industry. Celly manufactures and distributes mobile accessories which are designed in Italy. In Finland the company first aims to strengthen its distribution channels and afterwards base managers in other Nordic countries. The company sees Helsinki as a valuable gateway to Russia, but doesn’t have plans to access the Russian market in the immediate future. ”At the moment we are focusing a lot on the retail chains and telecom operators in Finland. Also the fashion industry interests us as design and quality part are very important for Celly,” Fink-Jensen says. “We have our own stores only in Italy at the moment, but we are considering opening flagship stores in other countries as well. In the future we could have a flagship store in Helsinki.” Celly has already found a warehouse and showroom in Finland and is now looking for the right office space in Helsinki for its three employees. In addition the company employs at least 10 people through subcontracting and has plans to employ more people in Finland as operations grow. ”We intend to have a fully structured company in Finland, including customer service and field sales force,“ Fink-Jensen comments. Globally Celly employs around 80 people, most of them in Italy, and reached a turnover of 28 million euros in 2012. Celly describes its decision to expand to Finland as a major investment. Celly also met with different Finnish organisations, including Helsinki Business Hub and NewCo Factory, prior to making the final decision. ”Helsinki has a well-trained competitively priced workforce in a unique geographic location and a very friendly public soft landing service, which were good enough to get Celly Spa to come here,” said NewCo Factory start-up advisor  . “This is a good start which I expect to bring more companies to Helsinki and hopefully Finnish companies doing more deals with the foreign companies entering Finland.” Editor’s note: This article is published in cooperation with  and"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/laitila-goes-global/,Laitila goes global,"The soon-to-be-20-year-old company Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas intends to set out for the global markets. This is the year’s hottest season.  began operations in 1995, producing old-fashioned lemonades in a modest setting at an ancient egg drilling plant. Initially, the drinks were made by hand using in-house built equipment all the way through to gluing the labels. “What we may have lacked in industry knowledge was largely compensated by the passion we put into what we were doing. Our growth story has been full of bold risks that we have taken with a firm belief in the future. And we would have never achieved growth if it hadn’t been for the risks and a clear operating model of our own,” says CEO  . Over the years, Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas, which operates in Laitila in Western Finland, has grown into the fourth largest brewery in Finland. The company operates in a trendy industry, as the number of small-scale breweries is currently higher than ever. “The focus of growth is gradually being shifted towards exports and discovering new markets. We are currently exporting our products to Estonia, and are working on Sweden, the United States, the UK and Japan,” Aarikka says. In Aarikka’s view, the small-scale brewery trend is a global one. “Even the economic downturn can’t slow down growth in an industry where quality rules over quantity.” The Laitila-based company’s product offering includes nostalgic lemonades, beers, ciders, sparkling wines and gin grapefruit drinks. People sometimes refer to the company as a retro brand. Aarikka would rather describe it as a classic blueprint that the company has stayed true to since day one. “It was a no-brainer: we wanted to do things that felt good. But then again, it would have been difficult for us to sell high-tech, considering that we used to fill the bottles by hand and pack them in unplaned wood crates,” Aarikka says with a smile. Today, the products are manufactured in a modern facility, but using traditional methods and wind power. Speaking of international markets, there are some interesting projects underway in cider products, but Aarikka promises to disclose more information on them in due course."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/arctic-power-berries-make-finlands-natural-treats-travel/,Arctic Power Berries make Finland’s natural treats travel,"For someone who has grown up in the Finnish Lapland, the big city berries don’t quite cut it. Two now-Londoners born and bred in Lapland, Anna Ojutkangas and Eve Suoyrjö, weren’t happy with the blueberries brought from Uruguay in tiny and costly packages; they wanted something else onto their breakfast tables. “Every time we visited Finland we loaded our bags with berry powders and brought them back to London with us. If we ran out between visits, my mom would send more,” says Ojutkangas. Last November the two flatmates realised they should bring powders not only for themselves, but others as well. Initially the idea was to get the ball rolling after they had finished their undergraduate degrees. Ojutkangas studies Sports Therapy and Suoyrjö Fashion Marketing at the London Metropolitan University. However, the future entrepreneurs lacked the patience. “We aren’t good at holding our horses,” the ladies admit with laughter. Bags of cranberry and sea buckthorn started appearing into Ojutkangas and Suoyrjö’s London flat.   came into being. The new entrepreneurs weren’t the only ones to think the idea was brilliant. From almost three hundred applicants, Arctic Power Berries made it onto London Metropolitan University’s start-up program The Hatchery. The program provides an office space and experienced professional help in Shoreditch, London. Although the company started out from nothing, things have progressed at an impressive pace. Ojutkangas and Suoyrjö have been pleasantly surprised to see how many friends and friends of friends have offered their help and expertise in order to support the newborn company. For example, they didn’t need to look for a logo or package designer; instead, they were contacted by the designers. At first orders were dealt with via email and regular bank transfers. The online store was launched in June. There are also three independent health stores in London that sell Arctic Power Berries powders. When the new packages are ready and in use, and the branding has been given a finishing touch, the products will hopefully be found on the shelves of health store chains. According to Suoyrjö and Ojutkangas, not all Finns know what kinds of superfoods are grown in the back gardens. One reason for the hastiness was that ’healthy’ and ‘natural’ are buzzwords of the day. A sprinkle of 100 per cent Finnish sea buckthorn won’t make a breakfast smoothie any less trendy, that’s for sure. “Had we stayed and waited, the ship could’ve had sailed without us,” Suoyrjö describes. Both members of the berry duo have spent their childhoods in the blueberry-filled forests of Lapland. When they have seen where the product comes from and what it contains with their very own eyes, marketing is easy. “Not all Finns are aware of what kind of superfood grows in what’s essentially their back garden,” Suoyrjö mentions. Some Finns have shown interest in the product, too, and they have asked where the product can be bought in their country of origin. Arctic Power Berries didn’t intend to target the Finnish market, but the online store delivers goods anywhere in the world – including Finland. At some point the berries might hit the domestic market. The berry selection will grow in number in the coming autumn, when blueberry will join along with cranberry and sea buckthorn. In theory it is possible that the range will be expanded further in the future, but Artic Power Berries isn’t one for five year plans. The biggest goal has already been achieved. “We had an idea, made it happen, and it worked,” the ladies say."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tribalearning-to-revolutionise-digital-learning/,Tribalearning to revolutionise digital learning,"Deals in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia spur on Helsinki-based Tribalearning as it launches a new personal learning environment. The edtech startup enters this competitive sector with a unique proposition to measuring and evaluating learning. It has taken Tribalearning’s 12-member team a year of hard work to get its first product, personal learning environment and smart learning data solution Triba, to the market. Triba is a free to use, open system that lets it users, or ‘learners’ as Tribalearning likes to call them, save, organise and search learning material in different formats and study these materials collaboratively with other students. “People use all sort of sports trackers so we have created kind of a ‘learning tracker’,” describes  , CEO of  . “The learner can set goals, monitor their progress, see data of their learning and self-assess it. Moreover this data provides the system or the teacher with tools for intervention if the learner needs it.” It is this novel approach to measurement and evaluation that makes Triba unique. Tribalearning claims to be the world´s first service to combine both educational data mining and learning analytics. The system collects data by measuring interactions and activities of its users, analyses the data and creates various learner profiles and learner groups, or tribes, with similar learning dispositions based on this data. Furthermore Triba can give the user feedback on how they learn and suggestions on how they can improve their learning, for example by offering alternative learning materials. This approach is based on the idea that traditional teaching methods aren’t as effective in today’s digital world as before. The approach is proving popular around the world. Tribalearning has fresh partner agreements with education solutions developer Numu Al Elmia in Saudi Arabia and consulting company e-Cognition in Indonesia. Both will use Triba to distribute their education materials and act as the learning environment’s resellers for educational institutions and companies in their respective countries. The foundation of Triba comes from academic research conducted by  , Professor of educational psychology at the University of Helsinki. Professor Kirsti Lonka and Tribalearning’s Mervi Palander emphasise a user-centric approach and openness in developing Triba. “Internationally 70 per cent of students using virtual learning environments drop out. It is vital to understand how we can improve students’ resilience and what kind of factors affect study motivation,” Lonka comments. “As study engagements decreases globally and in Finland, the million dollar question is what estranges kids and youth from our excellent schools.” Tribalearning wants to participate in gathering study engagement related data and provide it for universities for wider studies. In fact the startup has been cooperating with various universities from the start. “The methods developed by Kirsi enable us to measure study engagement, motivation, stress and related factors. No one else is measuring as vast amount of data,” Palander claims. Learners can use Triba for free, but for schools, educational institutions and other organisations it is a fee-based system. Teachers can access data to understand how their students are learning and to improve their own learning materials based on the user feedback. Schools can also gather wider data on how their students are learning. A third target group for Triba are publishers of education materials and applications who can use Triba as a market place for their products. Tribalearning has been eyeing international markets from the start. In addition to its offices in Helsinki, the company has representatives in London, Singapore, Malta, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. Tribalearning is especially interested in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets as there is wide demand for educational expertise. “Most of these markets are so called ‘growing education markets’ which don’t yet have strong tradition in learning environments among others. For example in Indonesia where GDP is soaring, they want to get their universities onto international ranking lists and are looking for Scandinavian partners for that,” Palander explains. “Finland, education and technology are a great combination globally. It has opened many doors for us.” The next goal for Tribalearning is to incorporate deeper analytics into its platform in conjunction with academic partners and it expects to launch a mobile app during the summer. Ambitions are high as the startup states its aim is to disrupt the whole education industry. “We want to grant access to learning for everyone, even outside formal education,” concludes Palander. Tribalearning claims to be the world´s first service to combine both educational data mining and learning analytics."

In December 2013, at the reception for the Finnish Independence Day, she finally decided to compile all her recipes into a cookbook.    The book is written in English and contains dozens of Kiialainen’s recipes, both modernised and traditional Finnish and Nordic dishes.  Fresh, contemporary, and good quality dishes are a must for Kiialainen, who has worked for years at London-restaurants. “The book is for home chefs interested in Nordic ingredients. It gives my take on what Finnish cuisine is,” Kiialainen says. According to Kiialainen, her recipes are formulated in a way in which they can be completed with ingredients bought solely in Great Britain. For example, the malt bread’s ferment is done with sour milk and Guinness beer. “Finns should be prouder of their food and their ingredients; they are clean, first-rate, and simply good. I would like for Finland to be known worldwide for its food,” states Kiialainen. The cookbook was published with Kiialainen’s own funds and employs an on-demand sales technique in her web store, where books are printed according to the number of orders.

Publishers produce content in a cloud service from where the company transfers it onto the reader’s ePaper. This unique invention has garnered a great deal of interest globally. “The idea behind the ePaper is very simple. Every morning at six, the readers receive their newspaper through the Bluetooth connection. ePaper does not require software updates or electricity. It works with artificial or natural light through the photocell located at the back of the ePaper,” says Leia Media’s CTO  . This innovation by Leia Media, a company established in 2012, is currently being tested in a pilot run by Helsingin Sanomat, where 60 families across Finland are using ePaper to read their newspaper. Next autumn, a new trial will start with another Finnish newspaper. “Distribution and printing account for around two thirds of newspaper publishers’ costs. These costs will be completely eliminated thanks to ePaper. The environmental emissions of ePaper are also significantly lower than those of a printed newspaper,” Halla says. No Caption Global newspapers are also faced with financial problems in their online business. Translating digital contents into profitable business has long posed a challenge. According to Halla, ePaper can solve this problem too. Leia Media has already been contacted by large international media houses. “Particularly North America, where a solution has long been sought for the problems of newspaper houses, has shown interest in our product. In addition, we have come quite a long way in negotiating with a German publishing house concerning a possible pilot.” At Leia Media, product development is an ongoing effort and several designs and applications have already been devised for the innovative product. “The possibilities offered by ePaper are endless also in areas other than newspapers. In future, ePaper could well be used in all applications that currently rely on conventional paper for conveying information, be it a newspaper, magazine or textbook,” Halla envisions."

From hospitals using titanium implants for surgery to companies producing high end products like jewellery, 3D printing has seen a swift uptake in recent years.  in Helsinki uses titanium to produce implants for patients suffering from head injuries or other skull related problems. “The process allows an exact replica of the implant before the patient undergoes surgery and does not require further changes during surgery,” says the university’s research director  , who is also president of   (FIRPA). Aalto University is participating in the EU project ArtiVasc to create artificial skin using 3D printing technology.

For  , maxillofacial surgeon and vice chair of oral and  surgery at Helsinki University Hospital, the technology offers numerous advantages and huge potential. “Through the manufacture of patient-specific plates and screws, 3D printing makes surgical operations much quicker and more precise,” he says. At Helsinki University Hospital, 3D printing applications in surgery already shave hours off operations and is invaluable when it comes to quality assessment. “Few companies able to handle this whole process from radiological data to implant manufacturing,” says Kontio. “We are one of only a few centres in the world able to do this.” Kontio says the next bit challenge is tissue engineering: “By combining 3D printing, virtual modeling with stem cells and tissue engineering, the idea would be to produce part of organs or anatomical parts of human beings.” Globally, 3D printing is estimated to be a three billion dollar business. Many universities and research groups in Finland are investing in the technology while Finnish companies are integrating conventional manufacturing processes and new 3D printing possibilities.  , for example, applies 3D printing in its products and processes.

A group of friends with a background in snowboarding and skateboarding started making their own clothes as they couldn’t find anything that they wanted to wear in the shops. “In 2006 it was suggested that ‘maybe you could do something more with this’ and that’s when we actually started. We have been working steadily for the past five years and we have a purpose, with a state of mind that we want to be the most successful street fashion brand from Finland. But of course, step by step,” tells  , project manager of  . Makia employs altogether nine people who only design clothes that they would like to wear themselves. In that sense Makia feels that its clothing is an extension of its makers. Finnishness and Scandinavian design can be seen in Makia’s clothing in clean lines and cuts. The clothes are designed to last even the harsh winters in the Northern latitudes and to stand the test of time. “The biggest compliment for us is when we see people wearing our stuff that was made over five years ago.” “Makia is a bit more than the clothes; it’s the way of life that we represent”, says Nicolas Prieto. Makia has created an international stir with its campaigns and stunts. Whether it’s a sponsoring agreement for Zimbabwe’s team in the Sochi Winter Olympics or a campaign with Finnish Formula One driver Kimi Räikkönen, the fuss is guaranteed. “We are such a small brand so we need to be smarter than everyone else, just to survive. We are doing stuff that we like and hope that like-minded people will like it too,” Prieto adds. An example of Makia’s out-of-the-box thinking is their summer 2014 collection  , which got its inspiration from Mika and Aki Kaurismäki’s film  from 1981. The guys at Makia decided that it was time for a remake and headed to the Finnish archipelago in nearby Helsinki. “Of course nobody, in their right mind would do a one-hour documentary feature film, have a radio station, 14 bands and a lot of Lapin Kulta (beer) on the boat for six days. But somehow with a lot of luck, hard work and enthusiasm, we pulled it off.” Makia has just launched its Fall/Winter 14/15 collection  , which is their third Finnish themed collection. Part of Makia’s brand is to use average blokes of all ages as models for their collections but this autumn world famous skateboarders, actors and photographers can be spotted in Makia’s look book. “We wanted to showcase Makia as a place, our way of life, so we invited different people from all over the world,” Prieto explains. “We showed them what we like to do in our spare time so we went fishing, surfing, on icebreaker ships, sauna, playing ice hockey and looking at Helsinki by night. What we wanted to showcase here, is that maybe Makia is a bit more than the clothes; it’s the way of life that we represent.” World famous skateboarders, actors and photographers can be spotted in Makia’s look book this autumn. Makia’s main market is Europe. The brand is represented in 25 different countries and last year its web store delivered to over 40 countries worldwide. At the moment Makia has its eyes on the German market and maybe the US in the future. “The US is a market where you have to be big or go home as the Americans say. For a market that size you would have to have a few million euros for pure marketing and it’s a bit too much for us to chew at this moment.” Makia’s every move is thought through to avoid past mistakes when going into new markets. “Every market has its own laws in a way but then again, we feel that we are going to sell clothes to people like us and we are quite certain that they are all over the world,” Prieto sums up."

The largest markets are, however, in Japan. “Together with our partner we have a store in Kyoto. We are planning on opening another store in Tokyo. Japan is interested in top-of-the-line Finnish products and, generally speaking, our product type is suitable for their market,” Kantola says. Lumi’s main product is still leather bags. Last spring its product range expanded with the introduction of a line of home scents and this autumn with a shoe collection. Lumi has launched its first collection of shoes this autumn. “We had been thinking about designing and manufacturing shoes for years but we knew that the shoe business was challenging. We feel ready now though,” says Kantola. Lumi’s goal is to manufacture ecologically sustainable products. More than half of them have been created from vegetable-tanned leather, which is more eco-friendly than multi-tanned leather. In addition, the company’s goal is sustainability through minimising its use of packaging materials. “The majority of our products are manufactured in Portugal and Spain. We usually try to manufacture our products in Portugal because that means that their materials are sourced nearby.” In addition to new product groups, the company’s momentum is being boosted by its activities on the global markets. Next spring Lumi is launching a store in Berlin. The company established in the United Stated in 2002 still exists in order to help with sales in the local markets. “We were very active in the US markets until 2008. That is when we had to downsize our operations there due to the recession. We are now once again increasing our activity on the other side of the Atlantic,” Kantola says. She adds that they are looking at entirely new market areas as well. First and foremost of these is China. At the moment, Lumi has, in addition to its stores in Helsinki and Kyoto, an online store which delivers products all over the world. The company also has retailers in more than 20 countries. In future, Kantola hopes that Lumi will have more stores around the world. The possibility is there as there aren’t particularly competitors focusing on manufacturing leather bags in Finland or even the Nordic countries. Lumi’s goal is to manufacture ecologically sustainable products."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/poyry-nurses-projects-into-life/,Pöyry nurses projects into life,"Finnish consulting and engineering group Pöyry nurses some of the world’s biggest infrastructure projects to life. From a power plant in Saudi Arabia to a rail link in Switzerland, from a dam in Turkey to a windmill in Sweden,   is working behind the scenes, turning the dream into reality. Take Finland’s largest waste-to-energy plant, which is being inaugurated today. The plant is designed to handle 320 000 tonnes of waste a year and once operational will provide enough power to keep 200,000 apartments lit and 100 000 heated a year. Pöyry’s involvement in the project began with an environmental impact assessment in 2006. It’s only just walking away now. “Seven to eight years is the typical duration of a large investment project from strategic level to operation,” says  , Vice President Sales. “That’s for a conventional plant. If we were talking about a hydro power plant or a nuclear power plant, we would be talking about 12 to 20 years.” The company’s key sectors are power generation, transmission and distribution, forest industry, chemicals and biorefining, mining and metals, transportation and water. Mika Pohjonen sees sustainable energy production and efficient use of energy as future megatrends. In his 17 years with the company, Pohjonen has seen a shift in emphasis. “With the stagnation of recent years in Europe, we have clearly increased our focus in South East Asia and Middle East. Within energy, the emphasis on renewable energy has risen all the time.” Pohjonen says the company’s background in Finland in biomass-based energy production stood it in good stead when it came to exporting that expertise. And he sees two megatrends dominating the next 20 years. “One is towards more sustainable energy production meaning renewable and the other is towards much more efficient use of energy.” Years ago, Pöyry began integrating sustainability and energy efficiency in its projects from the outset rather than add them at the end as was common practice in the past. Meanwhile in Vantaa, the new waste-to-energy plant is expected to have a significant beneficial environmental impact on the city and the surrounding area. Thanks to the new plant, Vantaa Energy will use about 30 per cent less fossil fuels in electricity and heat production. The plant will also substantially reduce the amount of household waste that will be landfilled. It’s that deep understanding of local conditions which Pöyry benefits from globally. The company has an extensive local office network employing about 6 000 experts. The new waste-to-energy plant is designed to handle 320 000 tonnes of waste a year."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ecological-reusable-wedding-dresses-drive-finnish-fashion-success-in-london/,"Ecological, reusable wedding dresses drive Finnish fashion success in London","Finnish fashion designer Minna Hepburn has been creating vintage inspired clothing in England for almost a decade. Her third bridal collection highlights the philosophy that clothes should not be designed for one time wear. It was love that took Minna Hepburn to England and the countryside of Dorset where her fashion label ‘ ’ was born in 2008. The showroom has since moved to London but a bit of country romance has remained. It is a world of lace, wedding gowns and delicate accessories but for the modern bride: “My new collection is very light, youthful and inspired by evening gowns. My principle has always been that my wedding dresses can be used more than once and for various occasions,” describes Hepburn. Minna Hepburn’s advice to anyone dreaming of working in the fashion industry is that you need to be ready to work very hard and market yourself. Minna designs reimagine the vintage style with the principles of being ecological and affordable. This is admirable as all clothes are handmade to order in London and their materials like traditional English and Scottish lace are locally sourced. There is some importing from Asia, but nothing goes to waste and any leftover materials are transformed into accessories. “My Finnishness is most represented in my ecological thinking, but also in that we are not making a lot of noise about it. In Scandinavia sustainability is more obvious part of life than here,” says Hepburn. “Some brands make a big fuss about being green, but for us it’s a natural part of the way we do things. Fashion should be fun and focus on great design.” Hepburn’s own journey into fashion is far from traditional. After majoring in war studies and working in the banking sector, her honeymoon in Asia in 2003 introduced her to the local clothes industry. Without any formal training, Hepburn started making silk garments which found their way onto the shelves of high street chains such as Topshop. But it took a few more years before Hepburn found her true calling for vintage style fashion and a passion was transformed into a full-blown business. Since then Hepburn has been awarded for her sustainable fashion both in the UK and Finland and her clothes have been featured in magazines like Elle, Vogue and Cosmopolitan. She has created collections for women, children, home and ready-to-wear, but the most successful niche was found to be bridal fashion – entirely by coincidence. Minna’s new bridal collection launched in early September. “I don’t even care for wedding dresses that much. For me the atmosphere, people and enough champagne are the most important parts of a wedding,” Hepburn says with a laugh. “But my business model needed a change and I noticed many of my customers bought my dresses to use at their wedding. This is how the idea for the first bridal collection was born. We were able to attract the interest of fashion bloggers and our collection got plenty of attention.” For Hepburn, blogs and social media are the most important marketing channels in the fashion industry today. There are no country limits online and, although Minna’s biggest markets are England and Finland, orders are received from all over the world. “We constantly receive enquiries from boutiques who want to stock our dresses, but that would mean raising our prices significantly. That is not what I want yet, or maybe ever, as it wouldn’t be the brand I wanted to build,” says Hepburn. For now Minna focuses on sales through its online store and showrooms in London and Helsinki as the label pushes for growth in Europe. But Hepburn’s long term aim is to build a global bridal brand that retains its ecological values and the message that a wedding dress should not be a one wear purchase. It is a philosophy that has the potential to go far. Minna focuses on sales through its online store and showrooms in London and Helsinki as the label pushes for growth in Europe."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pinguino-surfboards-adds-diy-to-the-finnish-surf-scene/,Pinguino Surfboards adds DIY to the Finnish surf scene,"Pinguino Surfboards is constantly on the hunt for ways of creating better surfboards in terms of quality, style and environment. The two-man project has grown into a stock company and its boards surf the waves of several seas around the world. In Ericeira, Portugal travellers can soon grab a Finnish surfboard from the corner of a hostel and jump into the sea. The rent is not paid in traditional currency, but in the form of feedback: how could the board be improved? The messages are carefully read in Tampere, Finland. Then   and   figure out how to make a good surfboard even better. In addition to making unique surfboards the duo also organise workshops, where anyone can come and create a surfboard of their liking. Initially Hakala started dreaming of making a surfboard just for himself. Together with his friend   the two lads ended up gathering so many materials that they had more than enough for sharing them with others.   was registered in January 2013, and now custom-made surfboards are ordered by not only individual surfers, but also travel agencies. The ownership is shared between five friends, but the main responsibility lays on the shoulders of Hakala and Juutila. Their enthusiasm to learn more increases board by board. One goal is to reduce the ecological footprint of the making of a surfboard. Hakala deems polystyrene, the material used for the core of the board, relatively eco-friendly, but using glass fibre for hardening the board less so. Replacing glass fibre with other types of fibre would make the board less toxic for both the maker and the sea. Pinguinos have already tested flax fabric. Another alternative is hemp, but according to Hakala and Juutila it’s hard to get hold of in Finland. The core could be strengthened with wood, which is abundant in Pinguino’s homeland. The environmental effects of epoxy could be reduced by using its plant-based version, although it’s more expensive and less available. The ultimate dream is to create a surfboard that’s so natural that it could, at least in theory, be eaten. There are surfboards that have been shaped from mycelium, the vegetative form of a fungus. Despite being a stock company, Pinguino Surfboards doesn’t look for profit; all owners are good friends with each other, and they make a living from things other than surfboards. Hence money doesn’t dictate their surfboard business, and smiles and shared moments count as a part of payment. Although a surfboard made in a workshop uses up at least the same amount of materials and double the time as one made to order, a d-i-y one costs the customers less. The makers know the tricks for avoiding unpleasant encounters with the maritime wildlife: Using stripes in the design is a way of keeping the sharks away. “Moneywise that’s utterly stupid, but we like seeing others learning and enjoying the process. We see the feeling we get out of this as profit, too,” Hakala points out. When extra money comes in, it’s used for maintaining premises, developing products and organising events. Next Hakala is going to spend a couple of months in New Zealand testing some boards, and Juutila will stay behind and take care of the workshops. At some point Pinguino Surfboards will get its own space in a showroom in Helsinki. Whilst travelling the world, Hakala has noticed Finn-surfers get plenty of help and friendly welcomes. They’re looking for partners for finding new materials and spreading the word. “Finland isn’t famous for surfing, and as we’re not seen as competitors, people tend to be encouraging and helpful. A Finnish surfboard is somewhat exotic,” says Hakala. In addition to exotic, Pinguino boards are also unique. Everyone can design their boards the way they want. One father wanted four pictures to be printed onto his surfboard, each drawn by one of his children. One of them drew a shark eating a surfer. The makers know the tricks for avoiding unpleasant encounters with the maritime wildlife. “In the eye of a shark, a human on a surfboard looks like a seal. Using stripes in the design is a way of keeping the sharks away.” Pinguinos’ ultimate dream is to create a surfboard that’s so natural that it could, at least in theory, be eaten."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-dads-take-the-baby-box-global/,Finnish dads take the baby box global,"For over 75 years, expectant parents in Finland have been given a maternity box stocked with all the essentials a newborn needs. Recently the baby box has become an international phenomenon after a BBC story about it became one of the most widely read on the site. Now, thanks to the entrepreneurialism of three Finnish dads, you won’t have to be a Finn to get one. ,  and   have firsthand experience with the Finnish maternity package. Impressed by its contents the Finnish dads want to offer expectant parents around the world the opportunity to get a similar box and a great starter kit for parenthood. “Our first child was born a year ago. When the maternity box arrived, I was amazed by the quality of the products and how cool and well thought out the whole package is,” says Okkonen. “Lately the Finnish maternity box has gotten plenty of coverage in international media and we started chatting with Anton and Heikki about whether there would be real global demand for the box.” It didn’t take the group of friends long to put the idea in motion and a month later the first   are almost ready for shipping. The aim is to build a baby box that matches the official maternity package as closely as possible, even including the cardboard box which can be used as a crib. The official maternity package will be matched as closely as possible. Contents change every year and include 40-50 products ranging from toys and bibs to bodysuits and a sleeping bag. The baby boxes include everything from bibs, toys and reusable nappies to bodysuits, bath products and a sleeping bag. They focus on gender neutrality, Finnish design and high quality materials. “Kela [the Social Insurance Institution of Finland] has done great work in designing the box and choosing products that best serve the needs of a family with a newborn. All of our families have put the products into strenuous use,” Tiittanen comments. “And like Anssi’s kid now, I slept in that cardboard box when I was a baby.” Negations with the Finnish companies supplying products for the official package are nearly complete. If any of the 40–50 items in the official box cannot be obtained (the exact number and styles change every year), earlier models or similar products will be provided. “The companies have really liked the idea and want to be part of this box of Finnish brands,  but the final products will depend, among other things, on the amounts we can order,” says Tiittanen. Okkonen, Tiittanen and Danielsen want to be clear that it remains early days for the baby box project but the level of response has been encouraging. “Although we haven’t really marketed the baby box, we have received a promising number of pre-orders through word-of-mouth. Mostly from Europe and the US, but also as far as from New Zealand,” Okkonen says. At the moment the pre-order price for the baby box is 459 US dollars (355 euros) but nothing will be charged until the boxes are ready for shipping. The dads stress they want to operate in a very transparent way and listen to their customers. “We had a chat with an Australian family whether the baby box would be suitable for [the climate of] Sydney in January. Probably not that well, but they still wanted to order the box because they liked the cool Finnish designs. It could be a waste of a snowsuit though,” Danielsen laughs. “We have already been in discussions with many people and learnt that, for example, different baby boxes for winter and summer is something people could want in future. But the official maternity box is an amazing product and we don’t want to change it until we know what our customers really need.” For now the three dads focus on building the baby box on their spare time and piling their cars, saunas and spare rooms with baby products. But the ambitions are high. “Of course we hope to build a product that appeals to expectant parents on such a scale that it can be built into something big. But we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves,” Okkonen says concluding: “We are just three dads from Finland who like the baby box and we hope all babies around the world will have the chance to spend their first nights sleeping in a Finnish cardboard box.” “We honestly believe that Finland is the best place in the world to raise a child. We have the maternity box, maternity clinics, free education, so many good things to build on. We want to offer a piece of that to the rest of world”, says Anssi Okkonen."

Or for concert tickets? This will be possible as of September following the release of the Mega Fan! game developed in Jyväskylä. The founder and CEO of  ,  , a Brazilian who loves subzero temperatures of -20, moved to Finland six years ago to study digital media. Prior to that, Toledo had worked almost 20 years in the music business as a producer, editor and promoter, among other things, and had the chance to meet many musicians all over the world. The idea for Fanart Games was born out of Toledo’s wish to bring the fans closer to the musicians. “The company’s idea is to produce games for music and sports fans, for example. The prizes that can be won in the games include concert tickets and records autographed by the artists,” says Toledo, who has been hosting his own radio programme in the UK for 10 years. The company was founded in Jyväskylä in March 2014, when the project was awarded a 20 000 euro grant from Microsoft’s and Nokia’s AppCampus programme. In just a few months, Fanart Games has grown into the second biggest gaming company in Jyväskylä. It currently employs 11 people. At the moment, the company is developing its first game. The Mega Fan! game is targeted at lovers of heavier music and the players can feature as members of their favourite bands and trade their scores for albums, photos or concert tickets. By the end of June this year, 15 bands from across the world had already joined the project from the United States, Brazil and Germany, among other countries. The names include Sepultura, Oomph!, The Pretty Reckless and Lord of the Lost. In addition, the company is currently conducting negotiations with potential sponsors and 15 other bands. The Fanart team aims to produce games that can get fans connected with musicians. “Usually the band members get all excited once they’ve tried the game. Being part of the deal is good publicity for the bands too, even though it isn’t traditional advertising,” Toledo says. The company plans to open an office in Helsinki too. Later, they might head for Germany or Bahrain. “The Middle East is an interesting market: lots of money but little gaming expertise. But first we want to gain a strong foothold in Finland. We don’t have actual competitors. The music business is generally quite hard to combine with the gaming business.” The game will be released in September for Windows Phones. Later this year, it will also be available for Android and iOs phones."

Alech software uses mathematical and statistical principles to help improve the efficiency and strategy of professional traders. The company launched one year ago, inspired by founder   realisation that many professional traders still rely on manual processes in managing their funds and trading strategies. “I wanted to develop a system that helps financial managers make more reliable strategies, make less mistakes and manage more money”, says Lam. “There is only so much a single person can do in terms of how many deals and how much data they can handle. Our system can analyse the whole Hong Kong market, with 20 years worth of price data”, within 2.5 minutes. The level of technology expertise in Finland made Lam turn to the job market in Helsinki. Lam claims Alech’s differentiator is its level of customisation. He argues that similar programmes providing trading data do exist, but they don’t ease the workload of traders as much as offer more information for people to digest: “There hasn’t been a platform that allows traders to programme their trading strategy into the system. From that point of view our system is the first in the field.” It is a new approach which is gaining attention and after securing its first customers in the US, Hong Kong and China, the company is now in the position to hire new talent. The level of technology expertise in Finland made Lam turn to the job market in Helsinki where Alech  started operations in the summer. “When it comes to skill levels, creativity and general talent, Finland is much more attractive in terms of people available in the job market than Hong Kong,” comments Lam. “Finland is more technology oriented whereas Silicon Valley is more business oriented these days. They are looking more on the balance sheet whereas here [in Helsinki] they try to innovate and come up with really cool technologies. And to me that is where the talent is.” Currently Lam is talking with two potential Finnish employees and is looking for suitable office space in Helsinki. The aim is to grow the company within the next two years beyond its initial target market of individual financial managers to institutional investors and major organisations. Alech knows it has a challenge in convincing the world’s circa 10 000 hedge funds to change their ways, but finding credibility in this sector is key to its wider long term plans. Lam wants to build a family of financial products that would be more accessible to everyone in the market. “People in the mass market, unlike professional traders, don’t tend to have very strong options on how they trade and invest.  We would like to provide an advisory platform for that market.”"

That is what a fear of the dark makes us believe and most of us have experienced it in some form. Now Helsinki-based hardware startup LeeLuu is helping children fight these fears with soft, interactive nightlights. The antithesis of monsters,   nightlights look like cute, animal-shaped plush toys and they can be stroked to change the intensity of the light or squeezed to switch the light on and off.  The nightlights communicate with each other wirelessly and one can be used to control other nightlights in the room. Moreover, they are designed to be played with. Even throwing them around won’t damage the sensor inside the textile case. It is this combination of touch, durability and interactivity which makes LeeLuu’s nightlights unique. “Textile sensors, which we have developed from the scratch, are the core of our products,” says  , co-founder of LeeLuu. “When it comes to smart textiles, we haven’t seen anything similar in the market.” The interactive nightlights were born about a year ago when the founders of LeeLuu,  ,  ,   and  , all participated in the same design course at the Aalto University of Arts in Finland. “I myself have two kids and one of my co-founders remembers being really scared of the dark as a child,” Pouta explains. “We realised that fear of the dark is a real problem for many kids and it can affect the quality of sleep for both the kids and their parents.” LeeLuu hopes that in the future all kids who are afraid of the dark will have their own LeeLuu nightlight. “We started building our first prototype and have tested it with over 100 first graders and pre-schoolers. Their feedback has been great. We can say our target users have proved that our concept works.” “We have learnt valuable business development skills, but even more importantly we have built a precious network during the summer,” says Pouta. Stepping into the world of entrepreneurship has meant learning new skills for the team of designers. Rolling into the Summer of Startups programme for promising startups has helped LeeLuu to develop the business side of the company. “All the teams supported each other and the coaches have continued to help us even after the programme. It has been a positive surprise how open and supportive the startup scene in Helsinki is.” At the moment LeeLuu is focusing on finalising its manufacturing prototype. It will be showcased in October at the TechCruch Disrupt technology event in London. LeeLuu was awarded with a booth at the event after the company won the TechCrunch pitching competition in Helsinki. LeeLuu has also started preliminarily discussions with potential manufacturers, but extra funding is needed before the actual production process can be started. If everything goes well, the company aims to bring its first products into the European markets in December 2015. LeeLuu’s vision is to grow into an innovative company producing interactive textile products. But children will stay as their core target group. “Working with kids has been one of the best parts of the process,” Pouta says. “They are honest with their feedback but also challenging as users.” “Our aim is to build a whole family of textile products targeted at kids. LeeLuu nightlights are designed to endure cuddles and games."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pint-please-from-oulu-takes-on-the-world/,Pint Please from Oulu takes on the world,"The developer of the Pint Please mobile application, Juha Karppinen, is a difficult man to get hold of. The beer app, developed in Oulu, has just been launched in the UK, and London is keeping him busy. In honour of the launch more than 100 British pubs are serving a special Pint Please beer brewed by Oakham Ales. Karppinen says that the inspiration for the   application came to him in a pub, “like any good idea”. “I was sitting in a pub a couple of years ago and I was having trouble recalling the name of a good beer that I’d had at the same pub couple of weeks earlier,” he recalls. “I discussed the problem with my friends  ,   and   and they all seemed to share my problem remembering the names of beers. As the guys all happened to be extremely qualified programmers and graphic artists, we decided to come up with a solution.” Since the fateful night at the pub, Karppinen, Laine, Kivijärvi and Tapaninen have worked on their idea. The friends have backgrounds at Nokia and Microsoft and they all have previous experience of startups. They came up with something that is far more than just an app for remembering the names of beers. Pint Please is a tool that users can use to record the beers they have enjoyed, get recommendations on beers they might like and which pub is worth visiting. All of the recommended beers and pubs are local, so the app finds pubs and beers near to you. The beer app, developed in Oulu, has just been launched in the UK. Pubs and breweries can use the app as a sales and marketing tool. It offers them the opportunity to target their advertising at a specific group and receive information on the preferences of their customers and on their competitors. The application can be used anywhere in the world but it is only available for downloading in Finland, Malta and the UK. Pint Please sees the UK as its key market area but countries with a prevalent beer culture such as Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Australia, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic are potential market areas for the app. Pint Please has recently received the results of its first funding round, valued at around 300 000 euros. The investor is Butterfly Ventures from Finland together with Finnish angel investors. Users of the Pint Please application have submitted close to 6 000 beer reviews for the service and the soon-to-be-released Android version is expected to increase the number of users many times over. “The greatest differences between Pint Please and its competitors are its local nature and the strong linking together of pubs and users. Many other applications are directed at beer aficionados but Pint Please is directed more towards the average consumer who also drinks specialty beers.” “Pint Please’s vision is to be the world’s most popular beer application in 2015. And not just a beer application but a beer community with all the information you might need on beers and pubs,” Karppinen says."

The customers of Trademark Now have reported daily savings of thousands of euros due to the product of the Finnish startup. Within the company itself, the amount of working hours is rapidly increasing: from the four co-founders the group has now grown to 14. “By the end of the year there’ll be about twenty of us, and in 2016 hopefully a hundred,” predicts the CEO of    . With the help of TrademarkNow’s search engine companies can, when developing a new brand, check the availability of the trademark. Kolehmainen and the chief scientist  say a process that used to last weeks can now be dealt with in a matter of seconds. “Normally the marketing team comes up with alternatives for names and passes them on to the legal department or an external law firm; then experts create a list of different search terms that are being searched for and analysed. After the analysis the marketing team gets a report which often deems the name unsuitable, and they will need to come up with a new one,” explains Kolehmainen. For a regular Joe unfamiliar with trademark legislation all the hassle might sound unreasonable. Wouldn’t a simple Google search be enough to find out if the trademark is already in use? Kolehmainen points out that a normal search engine might find another brand with the exact same name, but in the eyes of the trademark register that doesn’t quite cut it. For example, phonetic and semantic similarities and the potential unpleasant meanings associated with the name need to be taken into account, too. “At that point the searching tends to get quite complicated for an average consumer,”  Ronkainen and Kolehmainen say. TrademarkNow also finds out how actively the owner of a previously existing trademark has defended the brand. The end result is a risk analysis that estimates whether or not the name is likely to be accepted onto the trademark register.

The idea of making a machine work through the legal reasoning process doesn’t only fascinate the founders, but investors as well. In May Balderton Capital invested 3.5 million dollars (2.5 million euros) in TrademarkNow. Some of the money will be spent on hiring new employees. The headquarters are in downtown Helsinki, and the company has a one-employee office in both London and Luxembourg. In September an office in New York will be opened. The aim is to expand both in terms of services and geography. In the future TrademarkNow might recognise similarities in logo design and set its foot into the vast market of China. Product development is, and will stay, in Helsinki. Being Finnish is a quintessential part of the company’s identity. Kolehmainen has proven the good reputation of the high work ethic and high-quality education Finland has around the world during meetings with customers. “In New York some lawyers were really excited about the fact that the product comes from Europe, and even more so from Finland. They said they would never trust it if it was brought to them from Silicon Valley.” Some might say Kolehmainen’s got it in for his old colleagues, as the product seems to be well on the way to making them redundant. However, Kolehmainen and Ronkainen point out that computers can never completely replace human reasoning. “We intend to dispense with the boring and mechanical phases of the process. That way lawyers can focus on more interesting tasks, for which customers are willing to pay full money.” The customers of TrademarkNow pay the company an annual fee that entitles them to an unlimited amount of searches. Hence TrademarkNow targets big corporations for which new brands are a part of everyday work. Despite this the company doesn’t forget its peers, enthusiastic startups full of great ideas. Hence it is possible to purchase the license for just a day, too. “Then the potential names can be checked right away whilst brainstorming for new ideas,” says Kolehmainen.

Tutor Tigers is an online service designed to help second-language English speakers learn and sharpen their skills. “Schools often only have time to teach the basics of grammar and vocabulary,” says CEO  . “The coaching of pronunciation skills requires a level of personal attention from teachers that is rarely possible. This gap creates a huge demand for language learning from students and graduates. “ Prospective students log in to the website and take the starting test before registering for a tutorial, an hour-long Skype call, with professionally accredited native English speakers. The company analyses the recordings so each tutorial has a small group of learners who have similar test results. The students read out loud an online article, taking turns to read one sentence at a time with the tutors correcting mistakes. After five tutorials, they can take the starting test again and see how they have improved. “The idea came to me when I was travelling in Vietnam,” says Lemmetty. “I noticed people knew a lot of complex words, and they had really good grammar and understood how to build sentences but they couldn’t pronounce stuff. “ Remembering how he had learned English at school, reading through a text with the teacher, Lemmetty reasoned that tutor and pupil did not need to be face to face and that he could bring the practice online. The company charges five dollars for each tutorial, paying the teachers for their hours and taking a cut. From Vietnam, Tutor Tigers hopes to expand to other key markets in China and Southeast Asia. The service is currently operating in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam where more than 1 000 students have signed up. From Vietnam, Tutor Tigers hopes to expand to other key markets in China and Southeast Asia. “The demand for English language learning is huge in Vietnam,” says Lemmetty. “Also, due to their own language being very different from English, they have a lot of work to do in learning to pronounce correctly.” “We hope that in two or three years we have started operating globally, helping people improve pronunciation in different countries. Asia is the biggest market for us but we think this is a global issue.” Lemmetty says that although the company is focusing entirely on English for now, other languages are definitely an option in the future."

GreenStream later closed an agreement with an affiliate of the largest electricity sector company in the world – the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC). GreenStream’s biggest market by far is the ‘land of the dragon’. After all, according to GreenStream’s CEO  , China is not only the biggest market in the world but it also has the most significant environmental problems. “They have polluted water, air and soil. Now they are determined to solve their environmental problems. Surprisingly, they have become one of the most innovative developers of policy tools for a cleaner environment,” Nykänen says. GreenStream is using its extensive industry knowledge to help run active emissions trading pilot schemes and develop energy efficiency projects in China. In addition to its 80 emission reduction projects, GreenStream has 10 active energy efficiency projects in China and another 40 in the pipeline. “We have worked a lot with Chinese energy companies to reduce energy inefficiencies.” Nykänen believes Finnish companies have an advantage in China, especially in markets such as energy efficiency and clean technology. “I think it’s quite easy for Finns to work with Chinese people for a number of reasons. First, because they value their reputation very highly, we can trust them to keep their promise. Similarly, Finns don’t over-promise their services. So the Chinese trust us and we trust them.” The second reason is that Chinese companies are looking for the best technology in the world and they are turning to Finnish companies because they have a world-class reputation in cleantech. “When they visit us and see our well-managed heavy industry and unpolluted nature, they realise we are good at environmental preservation and so they trust our cleantech expertise. Third, the Chinese always have a long-term strategy and when they start a business partnership they stay committed to it.” Since its beginnings in 2001, the company has had to modify its business concept multiple times to adapt to continual changes in the industry. “Our market has disappeared at least three times in the last 13 years. But we have always been able to rebuild and change direction quickly when needed. That has been our biggest advantage. The current business environment requires an ability to change and adapt fast.”"

Of all the products designed and produced in its lakeside factory in the town of Iisalmi, almost 500km north of Helsinki, more than 80 per cent are shipped abroad to over 70 countries. Global events such as the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup used its premium sound monitoring products. The company, founded in 1978, is  . This powerhouse of the professional audio world is proud of its Finnish roots, culture and location and refuses to follow its competitors in moving production to Asia in an attempt to improve profitability. “Yes, the cost of production here in Finland is higher than for example in China, so it’s hard to compete with that. Over 90 per cent of our competitors make their products in China, so we may have a disadvantage if we only look at the numbers,” says Genelec’s managing director  . “But Genelec is a premium brand. We don’t want to compete on price. Instead, we want to continue focusing on our core strengths of reliability, sound quality, design and environmental friendliness.” Genelec doesn’t want to compete on price. Instead it focuses on reliability, sound quality, design and environmental friendliness. Quality control of production and distribution are just as valuable to Genelec as profitability. In that way, Siamäk believes being in Finland is an advantage for the company. Whilst its location will not change, its typical customer has evolved. Not long ago a Genelec customer was a studio sound engineer, but these days it is more of a combination of both engineer and artist. “Today our typical customer is someone who monitors sound and makes sound. So it’s a sound engineer working for a TV, radio, movie or music studio and it’s an artist creating music. This very much reflects the makeup of the company itself — most of the staff play musical instruments, making them both musicians and engineers.” More changes are ahead for Genelec. Over the last decade audio quality has not kept pace with dramatic improvements in the visual quality of home and workplace devices, such as television sets and computer screens. Naghian is confident this imbalance will be rectified within the next five to 10 years. “We are on the front line to take advantage of this emerging opportunity in the home audio markets. Consumers demanding a professional level audio quality in their homes presents a very exciting future for us.”"

Their aim is to build a full-blown franchise covering movies, a TV series, games and merchandise. “We made one movie that proved we have a global audience and our collaborative way of making movies works. Next step was starting a company to build a franchise around it,” says Kaukomaa, head of business at   which was founded in early 2014. “Our community is active, vast and keeps growing.

It was created in collaboration with its fans who participated in all aspects of movie, from funding to image production. The same collaborative thinking continues with Iron Sky Universe. In May the company sold shares through Finnish equity-based crowdfunding platform Invesdor. In just over a week the company raised 265 000 euros – 500 per cent times its original goal. Now it has 430 shareholders from over 30 countries and another funding round is planned for 2015. “We feel this kind of approach fits the world of   and is a natural way to build the owner base of the company,” Kaukomaa explains. “We have always expanded our skills through the fan base and it has been vital for us. It`s the same idea again. We are not only looking for money and owners, it could even be that through this call we find advisors or members of our board.” Iron Sky Universe has an ambitious plan: Filming of the sequel will start next spring for a 2016 global release and the third movie is planned for a few years after that. Iron Sky Universe has an ambitious plan, but is taking one step at a time. Filming of the sequel will start next spring for a 2016 global release. A third movie is planned for a few years after that. The company is also looking for partners to create   inspired games and merchandise from pinball machines to comics. In the meantime a TV series is under development. It will be a prequel to the movies and takes place in the cold war era of the 60s and 70s. The concept is ready for five seasons in total, but finding distribution partners will come later. “We call it a TV series but it could also be an Internet series. The industry is changing and we want to keep our options open so we can ensure the widest possible distribution for the series when that time comes.” Kaukomaa believes that film and TV distribution needs to change and serve its customers’ needs better, and listening to its audience is something Iron Sky Universe knows well. “Consumers should be able to access the content they want when they want. There is still a lot of resistance to this and old structures that are kept alive, but slowly the traditions will change.” “There are already many successful cases in the US where films have been released simultaneously on VOD and in the cinemas.” The story of   is only starting.

Wuda Geoinformatics ( ), which provides professional geospatial data production, processing services and software for governmental information management, is seeking to expand its cooperative partnerships in Finland as well as to act as a partner and consultant to Finnish companies wishing to expand into China. GeoStar creates opportunities for Finnish businesses to expand into the huge Chinese market “Our company is growing fast in China and we want to boost this growth by reaching out to other key international markets, such as Finland. Some Finnish companies are already doing business with us in China, such as Pegasor, but there is so much more that we can do with the help of Finnish expertise,” says GeoStar President  , whose company provides comprehensive smart city solutions by integrating geospacial information from numerous industries’ data stores. “GeoStar’s new office in Finland means the Chinese company will now be able to close more deals with Finnish businesses and at a faster rate than before,” says  , CEO of Pegasor, one of the leading technology providers in the field of air quality measurement and monitoring. , Director of large companies and public organisations at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, believes GeoStar’s move into Finland is a strong indication that Chinese companies are interested in doing business here. “GeoStar’s presence in Finland gives Finnish companies an opportunity to expand their connections into the huge Chinese market. Finland has a long tradition of high quality services in mapping and surveying and foreign businesses such as those from China value Finnish ICT expertise in this area,” says Kanto, who has been following the GIS sector for 15 years. Both Liu and  , Executive Vice Mayor of the central Chinese city of Wuhan where GeoStar has its headquarters, agree. “We know Finland is very strong in ICT and we are very supportive of Chinese companies’ expansion initiatives into Finland.

The Helsinki-based company has installed scrubbers on its 13 vessels as a stopgap measure before new dual-fuel container ships are phased in for its entire fleet. The first two are due to arrive in 2016 with another two already ordered for the following year. The company estimates that the total cost of investments for land and sea will be about 250–300 million euros. “This is a huge leap for a family owned company but we see the environmental regulations as a big opportunity for sustainable growth,” says CEO  . The company’s come a long way since its first container vessel sailed from Finland to the UK. It now boasts 600 employees in 21 countries and transports up to 1,500 TEUs a day. “Our strategy is to stay well ahead of the curve when it comes to environmental regulations”, says Kari-Pekka Laaksonen. Most of the company’s operations take place in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English channel with Mediterranean sales accounting for a fifth of total business. Containerships carries consumer goods, automotive parts, furniture, fruit and vegetables from Europe and the UK to Finland, Russia and the Baltics. In the other direction, it carries timber and products from the paper and steel industries. The company uses its own fleet of sea-going vessels and containers and employs barges, railway and road trucks to move goods between ports.  has not been immune to the recession and slow recovery in Europe but is optimistic about the future and relatively undismayed by the uncertainty surrounding Russian trade caused by EU sanctions and the threat of counter measures. “We still see a significant potential growth within markets we are operating, says Laaksonen. In the long term we see a lot of industry projects in Russia and a lot of warehousing products being implemented over there so we believe that there will be a lot of growth in products to be imported in the future.” However, it’s the tough new sulphur emission rules, which have posed one of the biggest challenges to the industry. From the start of the next year, all ships operating in the Baltic and North Sea will have to use a fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 0.1 percent compared to the current one per cent. “It is a huge challenge for all of us operating in this geographical area because, no matter what, we all have to find a new fuel solution, which can be implemented already in a few months time,” says Laaksonen. All four of the company’s new ships will use liquefied natural gas (LNG) but will also be able to burn conventional marine diesel oil or heavy fuel. Containships says it will be first short sea container operator in Europe to run ships on LNG. “Our strategy is to stay well ahead of the curve when it comes to environmental regulations and to be a pioneer in eco-friendly shipping,” says Laaksonen. Containerships carries consumer goods, automotive parts, furniture, fruit and vegetables from Europe and the UK to Finland, Russia and the Baltics."

Luckily the Finnish company Framery has solved the problem by updating the humble phone booth for the 21st century.  was born in 2010 when engineers   and   noticed how phone calls contribute to a noisy office environment. They realised that creating a quiet place would give callers privacy as well as to reduce distractions for everyone else. It was not an easy process, but Framery are pleased with the solution they developed. “After many generations now we can say that we have the best office phone booth. It took a lot of research to get to this point, but fortunately we have closely co-operated with an excellent Finnish engineering consulting company specialising in acoustics,” says  , Framery’s sales manager. These phone booths are not the battered relics of urban street decay but instead high-tech tools for interior use. Framery has several models which range in size from a small private box to a larger room which can accommodate multiple people. Moreover, they can be moved to fit almost anywhere in an open office. Framery’s phone booths are not the battered relics of urban street decay but high-tech tools for interior use. The Tardis, the machine shaped like a phone box in TV’s  , has an interior which seems much larger than its exterior. Framery’s booths have a similar quality, but the impression of space is due to a generous use of clear glass. The booths also take inspiration from traditional Nordic design simplicity. “Design is enormously important. When creating inspiring spaces there is no room for awkward design or products,” Karvinen continues. Yet these booths are not used simply for their aesthetic value. Their purpose is to provide a quiet environment. “It is important to remember that a phone booth is a functional product, so the design cannot replace acoustics. For example, we were recently at a London design fair. The design of our model O phone booth turned many architects’ heads, but they were not convinced until they tested the excellent soundproofing.” Technology and finance companies are some of the main users of the Framery booths, but even industrial and engineering firms are customers. The Scandinavian bank Nordea, Finnish industrial company Wärtsilä and American high-tech powerhouse Twitter use the booths. Framery signed their first agreement in India during the autumn of 2013 and are now expanding their distribution network in Europe and North America. They continue to innovate and develop their product but are coy about what they will release next. “We are doing market research and have an insight on the next big thing in the phone booth product category,” Karvinen concludes."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vrt-revolutionises-underwater-imaging-technology/,VRT revolutionises underwater imaging technology,"A Finnish company’s innovative technology allows people to see underwater – and helps prevent divers from being eaten by crocodiles. The crystal clear water one sees in pictures on holiday post cards is an aberration. Most water is actually rather opaque, and this creates all sorts of problems for people who need to see what is happening in the depths. Two Finnish civil engineers,   and  , recognised the problem and developed a solution. “Our founders were looking at diver videos from underwater construction. In Finland it’s hard to see anything because the water is murky and they were thinking that there must be another way to do this,” says  , CEO of  . Their idea involved using sonar. Using sound waves to recognise things underwater is a relatively old technology, but VRT’s innovation was how that data is interpreted and displayed. Auer and Hänninen closely guard their novel technology. “They are still the only two people who know exactly how it happens, so it is sort of like a secret Coca-Cola recipe,” Tuominen continues. Kirsi Hänninen returning from an inspection trip in Brisbane. VRT’s technology allows the inspection of underwater structures, such as harbour walls, bridge piers, dams or pipelines. The resulting 3D images enable engineers to see structural conditions and the topography of the river or seabed. They can then pinpoint the need for maintenance or repair work. Underwater structures are normally inspected by divers, but there are a number of difficulties with this approach. Diving can be dangerous: currents could sweep divers away, equipment failures could put their lives at risk, and in some places in the world they could even be eaten. “Healthy divers’ meat is the crocodiles’ favourite dish. Diving companies have special cages for divers in waters which bustle with crocodiles. This is an extra cost for clients and makes inspection work even more difficult,” says  , VRT’s head of operations in Australia. Instead of sending divers down to swim with Australia’s salties, engineers can instead lower the sonar equipment from boats, solid platforms or even mobile platforms like trucks or railway cars. VRT is growing at about a 100 per cent rate annually. They have strong demand in the Baltic area, but are also receiving attention from all over the world. Tuominen points out that most of the world’s major cities are located on water and much of the infrastructure is decades old. “Global engineering firms, public road and railway companies and even diving firms discovered immediately VRT’s potential to help in their existing problems,” says Ahonen. The company’s services are so obviously useful that VRT is breaking some stereotypes. “I’m most excited when I see how fast our type of new solution is adopted, even in the public sector which everyone sees as slow and bureaucratic,” concludes Tuominen. VRT’s 3D images enable engineers to see structural conditions and the topography of the river or seabed."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/capture-design-combines-interior-design-and-3d-visualisation/,Capture Design combines interior design and 3D visualisation,"Russian-Finnish duo Marina Smirnova and Ida Broms started innovative design company Capture Design out of a shared love for 3D modelling. It all started with a lunch. Smirnova and Broms were responsible for 3D modelling and rendering at the same architectural office in Helsinki when a lunch discussion evolved into a business idea. Six months later, in June 2014,   opened. “Last March we went to a construction trade fair to try out our ideas and only had some very simple printed materials with us. People were very excited and we got our first customers right there and then. That really validated our plans to start a company,” Smirnova says. What Capture Design offers is spatial design concepts, interior and exterior renderings and product and catalogue visualisations. The company specialises in creating photorealistic 3D renderings through a combination of market analysis, artistic education and digital technology. It is this mix of services which the co-founders see as their competitive advantage. “We combine interior design and digital technology in a way that the end result looks like a real photo. People can’t usually differentiate between a photo and our 3D rendering. Since we use a freelance network we can offer high-quality services with an affordable price,” Smirnova explains. “Let’s say we have a customer who is building a house and wants to market it. We’ll do the whole interior design concept and also create all marketing materials for the house. We offer a full design package and that is rare in Finland,” Broms continues . Smirnova and Broms see Helsinki as a good place for startups. For Capture Design today’s work environment means working over country borders. The founders are based in Helsinki, their 3D artist lives in Thailand and the company works closely with other freelance 3D artists in Russia. They believe that skills and sharing a common language matter more than being in the same country. “First we will focus on Finland and build a well-known brand here. But in the next three to five years we would like to grow into a 10 people design studio and expand to Russia and then other Scandinavian countries,” says Broms. Broms and Smirnova emphasise that the market for interior design and 3D renderings varies by country. In Finland they work almost solely with companies and 3D rendering is still deemed expensive while in Russia the market is more focused on B2C. “It’s very common for a private person in Russia to order interior design with 3D renderings. They want to see in detail how their interiors would look and are ready to pay for that,” explains Smirnova. “We would like to create that kind of trend in Finland as well.” With both Finnish and Russian founders the question where to base Capture Design could have proved to be a difficult one, but Smirnova says it was an easy decision to launch in Helsinki. “Helsinki is a very good place for startups. There is a lot of support and opportunities. I studied in Aalto University and they really encouraged entrepreneurship. I’m also very grateful that as a student from Russia I was able to start my own company here,” Smirnova says. One of the company’s advisors has been  from the Aalto Ventures Program, who sees Capture Design as an excellent example of a company that leverages both Russian and Finnish expertise in a highly visual way. For him attracting international talent is vital for Finland’s future success. “Finland is emerging quickly as one of the five leading hubs in Europe for startups. We hope that by creating an excellent environment for highly skilled newcomers from Russia and the rest of the world, we will rise to the top of the list,” Cardwell says. Broms and Smirnova echo this sentiment and want to encourage others to try their wings in entrepreneurialism. “You have to believe in your idea and just go and do it. Don’t spend too much time thinking about the risks. Otherwise you’ll never do it,” comments Broms. “Make sure your family or partner is okay with you starting a business because it’s quite a process. You are busy all the time and crazy thinking of your company and not all relationships can take it. But it is totally worth it,” Smirnova concludes. Capture Design creates photo realistic 3D renderings which are hard to tell apart from a real photo."

We want to do the best for our closest animal companions, and recent research suggests raw food is healthier than dry or cooked alternatives. The Finnish company Mush have been making raw food since the 1980s and now find their products in high demand. “All of our products are natural and we are imitating the food that dogs have been eating the last 30 000 years and what a canine would eat by instinct, if it was living in the wild,” says  , brand and marketing director of  . Mush’s ingredients come from Finnish family farms, except for reindeer which is roaming free in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. Many dog foods contain cooked meats, grains and various preservatives. Proponents of raw feeding say that it is more natural and healthy for dogs to eat raw meat, bones and organs. Mush’s food contains beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, eggs, oils and vegetables, as well as a few more ingredients with a Nordic touch. “We know where our ingredients come from: Finnish family farms, except for reindeer which is roaming free in Finnish and Swedish Lapland, and salmon which comes from fish farms in Norway which are certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council,” continues Tapio. Mush’s product line   – meaning “instinct” in Finnish – contain between 90 and 95 per cent meat, bones and organs while the remainder is vegetables. There are no grains, additives or preservatives, and the food is not heated. This is the Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF) diet. “All our products are as little processed as possible. We mix fresh, raw ingredients that are identically quick frozen. You are able to use our   product series just like commercial dry food, with the one exception that you have to remember to defrost it before serving.” 10 years ago most of Mush’s customers were professional dog handlers or owned working dogs, but there were more people interested in the raw food diet besides kennels, hunters and sled dog mushers. In 2010 the company targeted individual consumers, and they had perfect timing as raw feeding grew in popularity. Between 2011 and 2013 Mush’s sales almost tripled and they are seeing strong international demand. “Today our products can be found in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Slovenia. In Germany we just entered the Fressnapf pet food chain. The next step is to build the retail network in Germany to its full potential,” says Tapio. The public appetite for quality raw food for their pets is such that Mush sees even more international market opportunities. “We open in Denmark this autumn as we are signing a contract with a local distributor. We currently have ongoing negotiations in several European countries. The next larger market to enter will be the UK.” Today Mush’s products can be found in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Slovenia."

Most of the damage caused by TBI does not occur upon the initial impact to the head but as a consequence of secondary brain injury. Currently, there are no drugs that can stop this development. Every year 1.7 million people in the US and 2.5 million in Europe suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could result from a car accident or sports injury or fall. In addition, millions more worldwide suffer from an acquired brain injury (ABI) like a stroke, or exposure to toxic gas, or growth of a tumour or any infection of the brain. Currently, doctors have no way of diagnosing or determining the amount and severity of the damage caused by a brain injury. “We are developing a biomarker, which could indicate whether a patient should stay for overnight observation or be hospitalised for two weeks to be treated,” says Harel The goal is to incorporate the biomarker into a quick and accurate diagnostic kit that can be easily used by healthcare professionals. Ideally, the kit would not only diagnose the presence of brain injury. It would also quantify its severity and indicate the precise treatment extent needed. Most of the damage caused by TBI does not occur upon the initial impact to the head but as a consequence of secondary brain injury. Currently, there are no drugs that can stop this development. “Since the injury is so complex, you cannot treat it with a single silver bullet,” says Harel. “You need a drug which will address several processes. We are investigating molecules that could stop a chain of events, several biochemical processes at the same time, thereby preventing the long-term deterioration of the brain.” Medicortex’s treatment involves three chemical mechanisms simultaneously, binding free metal ions in the brain as well as limiting the damage caused by free radical oxidation. This approach is aimed at preventing the secondary brain damage. The company, which is based in Turku, is looking for investors and has launched a crowdfunding campaign for preclinical development. In May, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, Tekes, granted Medicortex 94 000 euros."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-finnish-startup-looking-to-get-into-your-bed/,The Finnish startup looking to get into your bed,"Finnish sleep monitor maker Beddit is on a mission: to put a Beddit monitor to every bed. With eight million US dollars of funding raised to date and a major distribution deal in the US, it is off to a strong start.  first rose to the headlines when its 2013 Indiegogo campaign became one the most  . The company hit its 80 000-US dollar target in just six days, eventually reaching 500 000 US dollars and received pre-orders from 106 countries. In January 2014, the first Beddit sleep monitors arrived to the market. “The Indiegogo campaign exceeded our expectations,” says  , founder and CEO of the company. “It generated so much media coverage and retail and investor contacts that we haven’t really needed to do any marketing until now.” A year later Beddit has increased its turnover a hundred-fold, total funding has passed eight million US dollars and it’s sleep monitor is on sale in the US, Europe and Asia. Meanwhile a new distribution deal with the home retail giant ‘Bed, Bath and Beyond’ means that the Beddit sleep monitor will soon be available in 1 500 stores across the US. Just in time for Christmas. “95 per cent of Beddit’s existing business resides in the US,” Beddit’s founder Lasse Leppäkorpi says. The sleep monitor is using an ultra-thin film sensor which is placed under the bed sheet and records heart rate, breathing and movement. The data is sent to a smartphone over Bluetooth and provides both sleep tracking and analysis with tips on how to improve the quality of your sleep. For Beddit the timing has been perfect as the ‘quantified self’ trend has exploded around the world. It also means significant competition as many wearable devices are providing sleep data as well as a myriad of basic sleep tracking apps built into mobile phones. “We can offer more varied and accurate data than basic wearables, but our biggest differentiator is usability. You just sleep in your own bed and don’t need to wear anything. It takes a few minutes to set it up for the first time and you slide the sensor under the sheet, but then you can forget about it,” explains Leppäkorpi. “We believe that tracking wellbeing will become invisible. Sensors integrated into our living environment, smartphones and smart watches together with intelligent applications will do the tracking and current wearable wellness trackers will become obsolete.” Currently Beddit employs 17 people in its offices in Helsinki and San Francisco and hires one–two new employees every month. Much of the focus is on strengthening the company’s presence in the US and Europe while putting significant investment into R&D. Beddit’s technology stems from Leppäkorpi’s own experiences as an athlete. A poor triathlon season made him look more deeply into the role of sleep and recovery to health. Later Leppäkorpi’s Doctor of Science (D.Sc) studies specialised in ballistocardiography, a method for analysing cardiovascular system based on measuring micro-movements of a person. Combined with his sports background, it inspired him to look for co-founders and Beddit launched in 2006. The sleep monitor records heart rate, breathing and movement. Initially the company focused on licensing its technology and providing sleep monitoring data for medical and fitness professionals, but in late 2012 Beddit decided to build its own user-friendly consumer product. “Now we have two different user groups,” says Leppäkorpi. “Our main product, the mobile app, is targeted at consumers who want to improve their wellness. But we also have a more advanced web service used by medical professionals, researchers and athletes. “We are building a new wellbeing portal for the web which connects our users, offers more complex analysis and links to other [third party] services.” A second generation of the Beddit sleep monitor will be launched later this month which provides a more automated experience as the app doesn’t need be turned on in the night. With it comes a bigger focus on coaching services and overall wellbeing. “We want to develop more ways to use the sleep data to improve our users’ wellbeing,” Leppäkorpi explains. “For example we are building waking up experiences based on the data. In the future our APIs could be integrated with smart home systems and guide how the house is heated or lit during the night.” With massive growth in the quantified self market and smart homes set to be a key beneficiary in the emergence of the so-called ‘Internet of Things’, Beddit is well positioned to capitalise on both. Never has it been better to be asleep on the job."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/magisso-solves-kitchen-problems-through-crowdsourcing/,Magisso solves kitchen problems through crowdsourcing,"Fancy design is not enough for Magisso, a manufacturer of kitchen lifestyle products: the product also needs to be practical and overcome the challenges we all face in the kitchen. Placing the bar high has been a successful strategy – today, the company’s multiple-award-winning products are sold all around the world. In many cases, the driver behind  ’s products is annoyance. The daily challenges people face in the kitchen make them come up with most interesting solutions. “Our first product, the magnetic dishcloth holder, was developed by one of Magisso’s co-founders. He was fed up with the dirty dishcloth always hanging over the kitchen tap, dripping dirty water into the clean water,” says Magisso’s CEO  . Magisso’s mission is to build a bridge between functional product ideas and the global markets. The company’s payroll does not include a single permanent designer – anyone can submit their invention to the company. “We receive some 400–500 ideas a year. Most of them come from professional designers, but also from other people who have found a solution to a kitchen problem. An increasing number of ideas also come from outside Finland,” Sirén says. Magisso was founded in 2008 and the company immediately began to go global. Not letting themselves be intimidated by the US market with its difficult reputation, the new entrepreneurs established a local subsidiary by the name of Magisso North America. Their courage is now paying off: this year, the United States will be the company’s largest market area. In addition, the major American chain Bloomingdales will start selling Magisso products in eight of its department stores. “North America is an amazing, but incredibly scary opportunity. It involves many things that are difficult to understand and, of course, a huge amount of competition. However, we have never been very conventional. If someone says “you can’t do that”, we take it as a challenge. It’s good to remember that no one is going to come to Finland to usher anyone to the global markets,” Sirén says. Today, more than 70 per cent of Magisso’s net sales come from exports. The company does not have its own stores yet, instead its sales are channeled through distributors. The company is constantly on the lookout for growth abroad. “China and Japan are also interesting markets, clearly interested in Finnish design. We have been present in China for just over a year and in Japan for close to two year.” Magisso currently launches around eight to 12 new products a year. The company’s products have received a lot of recognition over the years. Among the greatest achievements, Sirén mentions the Red Dot awards and especially the Global Innovation Award presented to the   series. So there is a lot of interest. The company currently employs six full-time employees in Finland and two in the United States. Sirén expects recruitment needs to increase during the next year. “In future too, we wish to solve the problems that our homes are awash with. I don’t think we’ll stay in the kitchen forever; at some point, we will set out to conquer other parts of the home as well with our products.” The road has not been without its challenges, especially in terms of globalisation. The company faces them with the same attitude as it faces the annoying everyday problems found in the kitchen: “Challenges are made to be overcome,” Sirén says."

It has asked nurses in Sweden to improve elderly care services in their country and it is helping Indonesia’s new president identify the most important issues the government should address there. Businesses can also turn to   to ask customers what kind of services they would want to buy or which features they would like to see in a product. “Campaigns that really work for our platform are ones that have really interesting themes for the target audience,” says CEO  . “If they are fans of a certain organisation or of a certain product or customers of a certain company, they have this natural tie. They want to have better products or services.” “We tell our customers that they really need to consider what their target crowd is interested in and how to activate them. We just provide the technological means to keep them active and engage them into giving the right kind of input.” Tom Laine Distribution is done by emails and web portal and in the near future also mobile applications. Game playing elements keep people interested as well as real life incentives for participating in the campaign in the form of vouchers, gift cards, prizes, access codes to free services. Laine says the platform is not really suited to event feedback or if the crowd is small. “If the crowd is only 20 people, you should talk among yourselves or open a Facebook group, he says. Size matters and with 30-plus you’re getting up to speed. The bigger the crowd, the more effective we are.” He says the biggest benefit is understanding a community and its hidden needs and the ability to evaluate the ideas using people from that community with the right skills. “It’s not just about collecting ideas but leveraging the wisdom of the crowd. Our technology enabling this is unique,” he says. He cites the role Innopinion has played so far in helping to develop national healthcare and dementia care for elderly people in Sweden. The company engaged nursing students in Sweden to come up with new ideas and then used the same people to evaluate each other’s ideas. The company collected over 330 ideas from 140 students and the success of its campaign last year has led to a five-year partnership with Swedish Care International. Innopinion has been chosen among the   by  . It has established a charity organisation to use Innopinion’s platform and services to support social innovation and co-creation for the common good.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-s-roal-takes-expertise-to-diverse-industries/,Finland’s Roal takes expertise to diverse industries,"Roal is a Finnish company which develops industrial enzymes. These are necessary for a diverse range of products and processes – from making food to creating stone-washed denim jeans. Five years ago many companies were worrying about the economic recession, but   were in the midst of an expansion. Business has been so good that they are now expanding again. “In 2009 we expanded our production capacity by 40 per cent with an investment of 24 million euros. We are currently running a big investment program to expand our capabilities and capacities. The estimated value of this investment plan is over 40 million euros. During this expansion stage we have roughly doubled our work force from 65 to 150 persons,” says  , CEO of Roal. Five years ago many companies were worrying about the economic recession, but Roal were in the midst of an expansion. Roal is in an industry growing in leaps and bounds: industrial enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts which increase the rate of chemical reactions. They are necessary for brewing beer, ripening cheese or even creating biofuels. By the use of these enzymes animals digest their food better, laundry powders remove more oils from clothes and paper manufacturing uses less bleach. “The biggest application of our products is in the animal feed industry. The second largest is baking. Then there are other food and technical applications like pulp and paper, textiles and detergents,” Kekki explains. The demand for industrial enzymes is growing around the world. Innovative research continues to find new uses for them and they also have strong green credentials. In many cases enzymes are more environmentally friendly than conventional chemicals and processes. With such a burgeoning global demand about 90 per cent of Roal’s production is exported. “We are selling our enzyme products to Europe, North and South America, China, the rest of Asia and the Middle-east,” says Kekki. Roal’s roots lie in the domestic alcohol industry, as the company was founded as a joint venture between the state alcohol monopoly Alko and the German company Röhm. Today Roal is owned by the alcohol producer Altia and Associated British Foods. Manufacturing and research and development are carried out in facilities located in Rajamäki, about an hour’s drive north of the capital Helsinki. Kekki is enthusiastic about the advantages Finland provides for Roal’s manufacturing. “Finland offers a stable political and economic environment to make long-term investments. For this kind of industry we have the major advantages of a well-developed infrastructure, such as with electric supply, harbours and the road network. Finland is also well-connected to the world economy.” But while dependable energy supplies and good harbours are nice to have, a company is nothing without its people. “Finland offers a good talent pool of people. The education system for the biochemical industry and Finland’s long history with biochemistry has helped us develop networks that can be easily utilised. Also, cooperation with authorities in Finland is very pragmatic,” says Kekki."

A group of private investors also participated, including   and  . It follows a seed round of 700 000 euros over a year ago. The team, which is currently about 10-strong, plans to bring more talent on board but stay at a modest size. “The funding gives us the financial backbone to hire people but we firmly believe that small teams can do gigantic things. We prefer to keep the company small and tight than grow too quickly at this stage.  We don’t want quality to suffer.” The startup has revealed few details of  , the title it plans to release at the start of next year but Soininen says it will be a new type of flying game with very rich character animations and a strong story line which will blend the genre boundaries. With hundreds of games coming out on a daily basis, the current gaming environment is challenging says Soininen. The Small Giants team, which is currently about 10-strong, plans to bring more talent on board. “It is a brutal market so the differentiation with the game itself is extremely important but also marketing and how to break through in the huge noise not just of other games but the whole app marketing market.” For Small Giants Games, being in Helsinki, one of the main hubs for mobile games development, has considerable advantages. The mathematics and coding talent is at a very high level but it’s the sense of community, which Soininen appreciates. “We have a lot of colleagues in some of the very successful studios and friends in new upcoming studios and this culture of sharing and talking is something unique.” “Coming from a small country, we understand the global market and it is not a zero sum game. If colleagues from another company succeed, it is good for everyone in the long run.” Asked how he would like Small Giants to be viewed, Soininen replies without hesitation: a small manageable company which creates great things."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/health-startup-cosmethics-decodes-toxic-cosmetics/,Health startup CosmEthics decodes toxic cosmetics,"The ingredients list of a shampoo or toothpaste can be a jungle of unpronounceable words. The newly launched Finnish Cosmethics app aims to change this by analysing what cosmetic products really contain. Seven years ago I designed perfumes and became more aware of how different ingredients can affect our bodies. A friend with a cosmetics company said that petrol is basically added to moisturisers in the form of derivatives,  ,” CEO of  , explains. “The cosmetics industry uses over 23 000 ingredients so the amount of data is enormous. I wanted to make that data easier for consumers to digest and started working on CosmEthics in the summer of 2013.” Fast forward a year and Rantanen is on the stage at the prestigious Techcrunch Disrupt startup event in London where the CosmEthics app was launched this week. The app acts as a barcode reader that provides analysis of cosmetic products’ safety. Launch the app, scan your product (or search for it by name) and within seconds you are offered an analysis of its ingredients. The app provides an ingredient list where potential toxins and allergens are flagged using a traffic light system. Alternative products without these ingredients are suggested where possible. For users wanting to know more, the app offers information on individual ingredients and summaries of medical research on the uses and potential risks of the ingredients on the toxin alert list. Users can also create and share their own personalised alert lists if they want to avoid certain ingredients. For example perfume or animal products, due to an allergy or ethical issue. These ingredients are then flagged during the product scan. The CosmEthics app was launched on Monday and is available in the Apple store. An Android version is currently being built. Rantanen isn’t alone in her mission to help people make more informed choices when choosing cosmetic products. CosmEthics has a team of seven working in its office in Helsinki and is constantly looking for new talents. In May the company raised a historic 250 000 euros from a group of Finnish angel investors – the biggest angel funding round in Finland to date. Part of the company’s appeal is the size of its target market. The main focus for CosmEthics is the European Union where the cosmetics market is worth around 67 billion US dollars, according to Rantanen. “The cosmetics market is actually bigger in the EU than in the US. Also barcodes and legislation are uniform across the EU. It’s such an attractive market that at the moment we don’t have any plans to expand elsewhere,” Rantanen explains. “Of course that could change in the future.” Currently the CosmEthics database contains some 5 000 products. It is only a small percentage of the ever growing number of cosmetics products, but the company aims to add 1 000 new products each week and rapidly include all the most popular and commonly used cosmetics. Users can also submit photos of products they want to have analysed. “We have now launched the first version of the product so it’s not yet the ‘Ferrari’ we want to it to be. We are constantly expanding the database and adding new features,” Rantanen says. The basic app is free to use but in the future additional premium content will be available through in-app purchases. CosmEthics is also building an affiliate model to give its users easy access to web stores selling cosmetics and to monetise sales generated through the app. However Rantanen wants to emphasise that they don’t rate or rank products, but simply offer alternatives which don’t include ingredients that a user wants to avoid. “What I would like to see in the long term is people make purchasing decisions based more on a product’s contents than its brand and a cosmetics industry where misleading marketing and imagery is eliminated,” Rantanen concludes. “We want to enable this change by offering a service that is so easy to use and customisable that scanning products becomes an everyday habit.” CosmEthics wants to make consumers more aware of cosmetic ingredients. When shopping for cosmetics, user can use their phones to scan a product’s barcode and get analysed information on its ingredients."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/china-s-leading-domains-owned-by-finns/,China’s leading domains owned by Finns,"In 2008, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which monitors the global domain name system, announced that it was initiating an application process for new domains. One of the applicants, the Finnish TLD Registry, was the only applicant for the rights to two Chinese domains – and was given global monopoly over them. In autumn 2013,   was informed that they had been granted the exclusive rights to two Chinese top-level domains:   and  , which have since become the leading  . They are the Chinese counterpart to the domains ending in   and . . To begin with, TLD Registry had intended to apply for the ASCII domain names based on English, such as   and  . In filling out the close to 600-page applications for ICANN, they realised that it would be more worthwhile to invest in China. “Only some 10 million of China’s 1.3 billion-strong population speak English, says the first investor in TLD Registry,”  . Westerners easily forget that using English-language websites and domains does not necessarily guarantee success when entering the Asian markets. Things written in the consumers’ native language stick better in their minds. On 24 October, TLD Registry opened its new Chinese headquarters in Beijing’s Zhongguancun, known as “China’s Silicon Valley”. “Many Chinese people need to separately learn what certain famous brands, such as Nike, look like,” says   one of TLD Registry’s co-founders who once studied in China. “In China even the media will come up with a simple Chinese symbol for, for example, a Western politician if they have not bothered to come up with one for themselves. And they are not always flattering,” Tikka laughs. TLD Registry has noticed that Western companies are very interested in the Chinese markets but the language barrier in particular causes them to hesitate. In order to penetrate the markets the company must be familiar with and respect the Chinese culture, language and business practices. “If you wish to be successful in China, you must think like a Chinese person. The fengshui master   assists us by keeping us up-to-date on the ancient Chinese calendar. We have used the calendar to plan the various stages of our business activities and their timing,” says Tikka. With the help of the fengshui master and other experts, TLD Registry assists its clients in building Chinese-language versions of their corporate websites or creating an entirely new website. A company can purchase for its brand user rights to Chinese domains ending in   or   for the next 10 years, for example. The client can also request an existing Chinese domain name without having to know a word of Chinese. “We have something like a shopping centre where big brands can lease premises and pay us rent. The only thing being that this shopping centre fits millions of stores,” Tikka says. Chinese domain names are selling like hot cakes; during the past five months, the fully Finnish-owned TLD Registry has sold altogether 55,000 Chinese domain names. The brands purchasing these include Apple, Ikea, McDonalds, Rolex and the Finnish companies Valmet and Wärtsilä, among others. An ever-larger proportion of companies registered with TLD are Chinese, such as VANCL, which makes the Finnish company especially happy. “In March, we organised a huge live auction in Macao, something no-one had ever tried before. We made history as we were able to sell 33 Chinese premium domain names worth altogether 182 000 dollars,” says Lindberg. “Entrepreneurs need to see opportunities where others see difficulties! Our auction was a great example of what crazy Finnish creativity can achieve,” Lindberg says with a laugh. What is important now for TLD Registry is to maintain its leading position as the owner of China’s strongest domains. “Of China’s 1.3 billion residents, only 650 million are online, so the markets are the world’s largest and growth is nearly explosive,” says Lindberg."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/palko-interactive-leads-the-way/,Palko Interactive leads the way,"Just a few years ago Mathias Eriksson ran his own advertising agency. Then along came an innovation that prompted him to sell his company and start charting new waters. Water in itself is not a foreign element to Eriksson, as he has spent nearly a decade of his life at sea. He has also worked as a designer accumulating lots of experience with car decals, signs and instructions – guiding people from point A to point B. From 2002 he ran his own advertising agency, where the MOI navigation tool was developed. “Once I realised that the application had its own, independent market, I started   in 2008. The advertising world I already knew. Navigation, however, proved so challenging and interesting that I couldn’t pass the opportunity,” says Mathias Eriksson. Eriksson didn’t rush the beginning stages of the company. Its operations have been project-based and it has only received minor development funding for its projects, no major external funding. According to Eriksson, the market for navigation services is only now really starting to pick up. Palko Interactive is located in Kotka, a city in Southern Finland. It develops mainly indoor navigation solutions – a business area where giants like Google Maps are too large to operate. The company provides guidance solutions for public buildings, like hospitals, large indoor parking areas and terminals, as well as events and festivals. Up to now, it has sold local MOI solutions that run on large touchscreen monitors. Palko Interactive’s Moi app provides car owners the exact route to their cars in a car park with a swipe of a parking ticket. (Photo: Palko Interactive) Palko Interactive’s   navigation, developed for Finnpark Oy, won the category for   last year. It provides car owners with the exact route to their cars in a large, multi-level car park with a swipe of a parking ticket. Right now the company is about to change course. It is working on a single, uniform MOI service that will work on computer screens, mobile devices as well as large touchscreen monitors. Customers and resellers will be able to download the MOI application and use it for their own projects or resell it. The new version can also be used to support other services that require navigation. “The service is free for end-users. The building owners and event organizers will be charged a fee, which covers all updates, new versions and technical support,” says Eriksson. A background in advertising and signs has proved useful in developing the service. “Navigation is all about guiding people. It’s therefore essential to understand the human mind. Our solutions are not determined by technology but people and their needs.” Palko Interactive works as a network, and Mathias Eriksson is currently its only full-time employee. The company’s three other owners also offer their sales, acquisition, project and signage experience to its use. Coding and physical installation work is outsourced according to the specific needs of each project. “We have kept our operations as lean as possible. Our tight cost structure also benefits our clients,” says Eriksson. Palko Interactive intends to launch the new, uniform MOI service within a couple of months. It was tested last summer in Kotka Maritime Festival. Finland is for now the company’s main market area but it is actively searching funding in order to start its international operations. According to Eriksson, Finland has relatively few places that require high-quality navigation solutions. International markets, on the other hand, offer real potential. “MOI is a cloud service and its operating principles are not tied to any one area or culture. MOI works anywhere. As soon as we get funding, we will hire a couple of key employees to launch our international operations first in Europe and in the US and later also in Asia.” It looks like Mathias Eriksson may soon be charting new waters again.

They shared the idea of improving the lives of people in developing countries through sports. Based on this idea, Perälä and Saranlinna established TopSpot in 2011. “We organise   tournaments in Africa, mainly in Nigeria, for any youths who are nearly or already 18 years old,” Perälä says. “We are looking for football talents whose careers we can start up and who can gain the opportunity to play in European clubs.” The idea behind TopSpot is to also help those who cannot pursue a career in football. They are provided with an optional plan for building their future. “There are millions of people in Africa who want to be the next  . Not many can do it, though. We believe that through football we can achieve a lot more than just a way out of poverty for a handful of people,” says Perälä. Other talent scouts at the tournaments, in addition to Saranlinna, are   from Nigeria and   from the Netherlands. De Jong once played in Holland’s major league and the country’s national team at the World Cup. He has also coached in a number of countries. More than 20 players have ended up playing in European league teams through TopSpot. More than 20 players have ended up playing in European league teams through TopSpot. TopSpot is community-based business, i.e. financial gains are not its only goal. The objective of the company is to help local communities and to nurture players leaving Africa into individuals who are aware of their responsibility. According to Perälä this means, for example, that they know that they are role models for those who cannot build a career in football. The company receives funding from Nordic football clubs that pay TopSpot to act as talent scouts for them. Naturally, TopSpot is not the only one looking for football talent in Africa; world-class football involves huge sums of money and clubs pay a lot for good players. Perälä describes this aspect of the football industry as extremely ruthless. “There are all sorts of people working in the field in Africa. A common belief is that you just go, look around a bit and take the best players home with you. Many people expect to make easy money, which attracts all sorts of vultures.” He emphasises that, in reality, finding players requires years of work and making contacts. In addition, the players’ work does not start until they reach the Nordic clubs; despite being good players they have a long way to go before they reach the top. TopSpot stands out from other talent scouts also through its unique content production. The company has developed the   TV series, filming for which is supposed to begin this autumn. The company has signed a letter of intent with the Ghanaian TV channel Viasat1 for the sale of the TV series. Perälä says that Africa is lacking in high-quality TV productions that are about Africans and for Africans. The Topspotted series is being aimed at the continent’s rapidly digitalising TV markets. “We realised that our Topspot tournaments don’t really differ that much from many reality TV formats that search out talent. Our series focuses on our tournaments in Africa and reveals the background stories of the players,” says Perälä. And there are many stories. TopSpot knows that in addition to being one of the most popular sports in the world, football is also, in many societies, a way for children and young people to express themselves and to try to fulfil their personal dreams. TopSpot’s talent scouts are Theo de Jong (left) and Hilary Azodo (far right)."

Now his whole family is involved in running Kaslink Foods. Many Finns – and indeed, many Europeans – have enjoyed  ’s products, for example cream and milk, traditional Béarnaise, Hollandaise and red wine sauces or sweet caramel, chocolate and liquorice sauces. Raino Kukkonen started Kaslink Foods in Kouvola, Southeastern Finland, in the early 2000s. The family dairy has grown fast, and last year its turnover exceeded 50 million euros. “From the very beginning, we have specialized in contract manufacturing. We manufacture dairy products for the store brands of various retail chains, as well as for food companies’ own brands,” says  , the family’s youngest son. Raino Kukkonen works as the Managing Director of the company, while his wife   is in charge of the office. Matti Kukkonen and the family’s two other sons own the dairy together with their father. Matti and his brother   also work full-time for the company, both as directors. “Already as students, it was clear us that we would work in the family business. I didn’t even consider other choices. Our titles and responsibilities have not been specified beyond Director because we are involved in almost everything. We share the work according to our strengths but important strategic decisions we make together,” says Matti Kukkonen. Kaslink Foods buys milk from local producers as well as from Finland’s biggest dairy Valio and other large dairies. The company started international business fairly early. First, in 2007, it started exporting to Sweden. “International business has its challenges, and launching it can take time. It’s particularly important that the quality of the products leaves nothing to be desired,” says Matti Kukkonen. Finland is still Kaslink’s main market area but the company now exports to 16 European countries. The current Russian sanctions on food imports have not influenced the company’s business, as it does not export to Russia at the moment. Finland is still Kaslink’s main market area but the company now exports to 16 European countries. “Sweden is an important milk export market for us. Our exports to other countries consist mainly of sauces and sauce bases.” Kaslink’s international business is similar to its business in Finland: contract manufacturing for retail chains and food companies. “Many potential international clients already know us and contact us directly, but of course we’ve made active marketing efforts in the international market as well.” Kaslink’s product development, factory and office all operate under one roof. The company has over 100 employees at the moment. “Product development is something we’ve been doing since we started the company. We often develop new products from start to finish but sometimes a client brings their own recipes to us. Our product development team will look at the recipes together with the client and if necessary, adjust them to suit production on a factory scale,” Matti Kukkonen says. Kaslink’s future plans include growth and ensuring its place on European tables. “Competition in the dairy business is tough. We intend to continue developing our products and operations in order to succeed. With big competitors on the market, smaller companies must specialise and operate efficiently. Our strength has been concentrating on contract manufacturing. But a company can never afford to stand still and rest.” Raino Kukkonen’s long experience in the dairy industry has propelled Kaslink Foods to success. The decision to become an entrepreneur has certainly paid off. Kaslink Foods has over 100 employees in Finland."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/moodmetric-s-high-tech-fashion-is-not-your-parents-mood-ring/,Moodmetric’s high-tech fashion is not your parents’ mood ring,"This autumn Finland’s Vigofere is launching Moodmetric, a wearable technology which measures emotional wellbeing.  is an attempt to combine some of today’s most innovative technologies. It joins biosensing with wearable technology and mobile apps, and throws in fashion for good measure. The system includes a ring which measures the emotional state of the wearer and a smartphone application which analyses the data produced. From there, the user can take steps to improve her mental wellbeing. ”The Moodmetric ring measures the autonomous nervous system signals that can be used to understand reactions and improve quality of life. Any emotional reaction causes a skin reaction – an increase in skin conductance – which is easily measurable from palm and fingers,” says  , chief operating officer of Vigofere. “The Moodmetric ring is a tech fashion item that represents Scandinavian design and Finnish high-tech expertise,” says Niina Venho. The app stores the data, so that the user can clearly see when she is relaxed and when she is stressed throughout the day. But knowing about stress is one thing; doing something about is entirely different. ”There is included a Calm exercise that measures the meditative state of mind. This can help the user to wind down just for a few minutes, even in the middle of the day. The score at the end tells how well the exercise worked,” continues Venho. The potentialities of wearable technology are just now being explored. Communications and location-based services are popular while another segment of the industry aims at measuring and improving wellbeing. This market has a slew of physical fitness gadgets, but fewer products are aimed at emotional health. ”The Moodmetric ring is the smallest wearable technology in the world which measures emotional fitness. It’s a tech fashion item that represents Scandinavian design and Finnish high-tech expertise. The ring is designed to be an item of beauty enclosing a high-tech heart,” says Venho. No Caption The first prototype was created by co-founder Henry Rimminen in 2012, and the company Vigofere was started early this year. The name Vigofere is a portmanteau of Vigouroux and Féré, two scientists who published the first discoveries regarding the electrical conductivity of human skin in the late 1800s. Now that a team is in place the company plans to unveil the product at the Slush convention in November 2014. ”We are interested in having discussions with potential investors, media, business partners and early adopters of our product. We are planning to launch internationally next year so we are busy preparing to get the product ready for customers around the world,” says Venho. While they have much to do in the coming months, Venho says the longer-term horizon is even more exciting. ”There are endless possibilities as to where emotion data could be applied. Never before has it been possible to have this data, literally in your fingers, which can be wirelessly combined with other information and functionality in the health and wellness area,” she concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/be-liv-exports-design-in-an-envelope/,Be&liv exports design in an envelope,"The Finnish design company be&liv’s journey has taken place off the beaten path. The brand was born as a side project of a Finnish company Sulattamo, when ideas started to pile up on the designers’ desks. Be&liv has only operated for just over a year but practically all of its products are already being exported. The Finnish company is just about to launch its brand in Finland. “Our starting point is very different from that of many other Finnish design companies,” says  , co-founder of Sulattamo and creative director of  . Sulattamo operates as a subcontractor for various Finnish companies and, in many cases, the company needs to design a new product from scratch. “We used to have products with a good idea but which never made it to the customer. We realised we had several ideas like that and thought we should establish our own design brand,” Uusi-Autti continues. Be&liv is known for its foldable designs: all of its products are designed so that they can be mailed to the customer in an envelope. This substantially reduces freight costs and the product’s carbon footprint. The customer is left to carry out the assembly of the product, which can be done without glue or screws. Janne Uusi-Autti, co-founder of Sulattamo and creative director of be&liv, intends to invest all the profits from be & liv into the company’s growth. It takes courage to become an entrepreneur; this is something Uusi-Autti has experienced first-hand. “2009 was not an easy year to start. We put everything we owned into the company. What took the biscuit was when we went to apply for a loan for the company, having done major calculations based on our 10-year-long experience, and were told that it was never going to work,” Uusi-Autti recalls. “During the first year of operations, we already made a profit,” adds  , project manager at be&liv, who has been involved in Sulattamo from the beginning. “When Sulattamo was founded, the world economy was in a difficult place and when we established be&liv, the situation was the same again. That bodes well, because the only way to go is up! You shouldn’t have it too easy right at the start,” Airisto quips. Be&liv’s first product, a reusable advent calendar, hit the markets in time for Christmas last year. Be&liv is determined to take on international markets with purchasing power and volume. In a bid to do just that, Airisto and Uusi-Autti have been busy touring international trade fairs and meeting distributors over the past year. The lamps on show at fairs are selling like hotcakes, and currently be&liv’s products are being exported to Europe, Middle East and, above all, Japan where the company has signed a major distribution agreement with retail chain Takashimaya. “Now that we have distributors in both Finland and Japan, maybe we can fill in the distance between the two over the coming years,” Airisto says with a laugh. “For example in Trondheim in Norway, two home decor store owners fell in love with be&liv,” Airisto says. “They ordered a few dozens of our products and put a product picture on Instagram, which became a minor hype in Norway. In a couple of weeks, everything had been sold out and they needed to get some more quickly. If the same happens in Japan, our production team might have busy times ahead next year,” Airisto says. The company’s operations and design take place in Finland and the entire Sulattamo team is involved in building the growing be&liv brand. “If we want to make this a bigger business, we need to go global right away,” Uusi-Autti sums up. “Without forgetting our home country,” Airisto adds."

But not anymore, a Finnish startup thinks it has the solution. Every year over 3.7 billion disposable packages are delivered to consumers in Europe solely from e-commerce, according to the  .

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/clothing-label-muka-va-focuses-on-local-production/,Clothing label Muka Va focuses on local production,"Finnish clothing label Muka Va was launched in 2003. Today, Muka Va stands out thanks to the design and eco-friendliness of its locally produced garments – and the company has set its sights on the global market. The first store that began selling   clothing, Super Mukava, was opened in 2004 in the city of Tampere. Super Mukava started out as a collective of several Finnish fashion brands, but ended up being a dedicated Muka Va store in 2011, when   became one of the company’s main designers. “Super Mukava is based on Muka Va’s collections, but we continue to carry more than 30 Finnish brands,” Kiialainen says. Since 2011, Muka Va founder   has, together with Kiialainen, expanded their retail network to 20 stores and a couple of new online stores. The garments are sold across Finland, from North to South. “We are already busy working on the next autumn/winter collection, which we will take to the Berlin fashion show,” says Emilia Kiialainen. Muka Va’s production has been concentrated on the Pirkanmaa region. According to Kiialainen, local production guarantees the high quality of the garments. The designers test the durability and functionality of all of their main fabrics in practice. “We are one of the few brands to manufacture everything, including the fabrics, in Finland. We order the threads from Europe, but the fabrics are woven in Finland in Orivesi and the sewing takes place in Tampere,” Kiialainen explains. “In addition to local production, we are all about being ecological. All our garments are made from natural fibres to ensure that they are long-lasting and comfortable to wear.” Muka Va’s products have not been targeted at any given age group; instead, the team want to make clothes that can be worn by people of all ages. “Our design is not about classic feminine style; we embrace Scandinavian purity with no extra frills. Our design could best be described as pleasant and as three-dimensional as possible in terms of structure,” Kiialainen says. The two main designers are already looking forward to conquering international markets while staying true to their concept. “We have already been approached by the United States, but we only want to start expanding our operations once we can fully invest ourselves in it and be sure that we don’t have to change our basic concept, which is local production,” Kiialainen explains. “The fact that we do receive enquiries shows that our label is sparking interest even internationally. Maybe we’ll start with the Nordic countries and from there venture into Europe.” Despite the moderate pace of expansion, major changes are already on the cards. In January, the duo will take their new collection to the Ethical Fashion Show in Berlin in a bid to find suitable retailers that focus on ecological every-day wearable clothing. “We are already busy working on the next autumn/winter collection, which we will take to the Berlin fashion show. That is our favourite season, as it lasts so long in Finland. I can’t go into detail yet, but our collection will soon expand,” Kiialainen reveals. According to Muka Va, its design is characterised by Scandinavian purity with no extra frills. In their recent collections, the main designers have been inspired by three-dimensional structures."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tellybean-aims-to-reinvent-the-home-phone/,Tellybean aims to reinvent the home phone,"Finland’s Tellybean has created a unique approach to video calls. They want their service to be simple and easy, even for people leery of technology. The industry calls him a “late adopter” but you might call him “grandpa.” For whatever reason, he is just a bit slow to try out new technology. You would like to talk to him more, but he isn’t quite ready to learn how to use some new video calling software. This might seem like a problem, but the Finnish firm   instead thinks it is an opportunity. “A confused grandparent, a reluctant great-grandparent, a luddite, a devout simplicity seeker – these exist in almost every family. These are the people we cannot call today with the currently available services. With a general trend towards simplicity and a growing ageing population it is certainly a significant growth opportunity,” says  , CEO of Tellybean. Tellybean has developed a video calling service with these late adopters in mind. The product uses a television, which is crucial because a late adopter might not have a smartphone but he will almost certainly have a television. “First and foremost, we wanted to make video calling more natural and immersive, so you really feel like you’re in the same place. The simple way to achieve this is to make it “as large as life”. For that you simply need a bigger display,” Lindberg explains. All that is needed is a TV, Internet connection and a device they call the Tellyphone. The service can also be used with a Facebook app. The company has put great effort into making the whole system easy to use. “We had to remove the existing barriers so the whole family could enjoy the conversation. We had to greatly reduce the complexity that video calling had inherited from its PC roots – account creation, passwords, user and status management are examples of these,” says Lindberg. While there are many competitors in this field, Tellybean has a unique approach in that they are trying to reinvent the fundamental philosophy of the old home phone. “The old home phone is the perfect comparison. You call a place, not a person. It has its own number, or identifier. It’s easy to use and – importantly for later adopters – it’s familiar. It harks back to an era of simplicity: clean, crisp and purpose built. It’s often said that to understand the future one simply needs to look to the past. That’s what we did,” continues Lindberg. After a significant funding round in 2013 Tellybean is now expanding both geographically and into new consumer segments. “There is an increasing appreciation for simplicity in general, and this is coupled with plenty of frustration with the quality and reliability of existing video call solutions. The time is right for a fresh new service that gets the whole family in the picture,” Lindberg concludes. Tellybean had to remove the existing barriers so the whole family could enjoy the conversation."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/plantui-grows-gardens-in-urban-homes/,Plantui grows gardens in urban homes,"Designer Janne Loiske loves cooking and used to dream about growing herbs in his home. When travelling abroad, he encountered various indoor gardens but they were neither easy to use nor pleasant to look at. He needed to invent a better one. “I wanted an indoor garden that is easy to use, wash and maintain. I also wanted to create a smart, beautifully designed device,” says Janne Loiske, the founding partner of  . Loiske is an experienced designer and has worked with many big brands, including Iittala, Fiskars and Nokia. He began developing his smart garden while still running his own design agency. From the smart garden sprouted a new company. Founded in 2012, Plantui hired top gardeners to help develop the product. Sales started last summer. “I believe that we stand on the verge of a radical change. In the future, consumers will grow vegetables at home. Right now many vegetables are grown far from the consumer, although it would be more ecological to grow them near. Producing food at home is our vision. It may take 10, 20 or 50 years, but we’re heading there,” says Loiske. Plantui’s values include doing things well and in a sustainable manner. That includes manufacturing the smart gardens in Finland. This is how it works. Once you have a Plantui smart garden, you choose the plants you want and buy them as seed capsules. The small, roundish garden has room for six plants. In addition to the seed capsules you add water and fertilizer. The crop will be ready to harvest in six weeks. Janne Loiske, the founding partner of Plantui believes that we stand on the verge of a radical change: in the future, consumers will grow vegetables at home. The smart garden is designed for all kinds of users, not only those with a green thumb. Its light is optimal for plants and it switches on and off automatically, providing the crop the dark resting period it needs. The garden’s smart irrigation system pumps water to the roots automatically. Despite all this, the garden consumes little electricity. “Even when the garden is in continuous use, the power it uses costs less than 8 euros per year, thanks to LED lamps among other things,” Loiske says. Plantui’s business model is built on the combination of smart gardens and seed capsules. Its plant selection currently includes herbs, salad greens and edible flowers, for example basil, coriander, violets and many Asian plants. Each seed capsule comes with selected nutrients to suit the plant’s needs. Plantui has benefited from the growing popularity of gardening as well as the increasing interest in cooking and locally produced clean food. The company’s target groups also include urban people who are interested in design. “We don’t have much direct competition at the moment. Many indoor gardens are designed to maintain store-bought plants, whereas our smart garden grows plants from seed. Similar products are likely to increase in the future, but I don’t see competition as a negative thing,” Loiske says. “Our advantages are ease of use, optimized growth conditions and lights, superior technology and low energy consumption.” Plantui and its network of partners operate in Finland but its products are sold in a constantly growing area. Currently, its biggest markets are Germany and Denmark. “Many people find our smart gardens in online stores but we are constantly expanding our traditional distribution network as well. Our definite goal is to reach beyond the European market, at least the American and Japanese markets – but in no hurry. We will manage our current markets as well as possible and only then step further.” In Plantui’s vision, the smart garden represents stage one of the radical change. However, new products are on the way. “We will probably launch our next product in the spring but we don’t want to reveal what it is yet. Plantui is a young company, but our goal is growth, naturally.” And not only the growth of oregano and arugula but the company itself.   The smart garden is designed for all kinds of users, not only those with a green thumb. E.g. the garden’s smart irrigation system pumps water to the roots automatically."

Woodchopper is currently out as a soft launch on Windows but from January will be available on Android and iOS. Jutila says if the company can stay afloat, it can perhaps dream of having a huge success in five or 10 years time. “It is a very long process. All the companies which are successful in Finland at the moment have people with at least ten years of experience.” They might differ on how to make their products pay but all the up and gaming companies have one thing in common. Their founders share limitless quantities of self-belief. High quality products, hard work and creativity in marketing will triumph in the end. “Keep at it, keep working. Eventually, if you don’t quit, you will make a great game,” says Jutila. Headnought’s Woodchopper is an ethical game which doesn’t contain any killing and you have to be nice to other characters."

Cuckoo Workout, which, according to its founders, is like Zumba meets Candy Crush Saga at the office, and Nordic Diet Apps, which instructs users on how to eat according to the Nordic Plate Diet, are bringing Finnish wellbeing thinking to the world. “As we are already out of our comfort zone, it is easy to go that one step further,” says  , co-founder of  . The young entrepreneurs at Cuckoo Workout have recently returned from a month-long networking trip to New York and Silicon Valley in California, where they met decision-makers, investors and possible partners. Mänty and  , the other founder of Cuckoo Workout, came up with the idea of the playful, sporty exercises when they were working in the same open office following an active summer. “When we were doing office work for the first time in our lives and sitting eight hours in a day, we could feel the effects immediately,” says Lehmonen. “We began gaining weight and all kinds of other things.” “Slush has grown so enormously from last year that it’s been hard to catch up with everyone. We have had many meetings with both Finnish and foreign investors, which have all been extremely interesting,” says Cuckoo Workout’s co-founder Veera Lehmonen (right), pictured with her business partner Ida Mänty (left). “I said ‘Why don’t we do jumping jacks?’,” says Mänty. “Everyone at the office thought that was a great idea. We just set the alarm to go off at certain intervals. I think we reserved the ‘cuckooworkout’ domain name that very day. Two weeks after the first jumping jacks we were already sitting in an idea incubator.” Cuckoo Workout wants office employees to get out of their chairs and do different exercises for a few minutes throughout the workday. The employee gets points for each exercise, which can be used to challenge colleagues. Cuckoo Workout is also about improving the workplace team spirit and individual wellbeing, and impacting the creativity and communality of the office. According to Lehmonen and Mänty, Finland is an excellent place for experiments and development, but if you wish to gain a foothold in the major markets, the United States, for example, is where you should head – that is where the consumers are. Cuckoo Workout has decided to incubate its idea in Silicon Valley next year. “If you want to make it big, you need to approach the major markets right from the beginning. We will be developing our service on location and for a precise market, not developing it here in Finland for a specific target group and then heading overseas with it,” Mänty says.  develops easy-to-use dietary coaching applications and helps people to understand the basics of healthy eating. The word “diet” in Nordic Diet Apps does not mean losing weight. It means having a healthy diet. “It all began with research that indicated that obesity is the result of irregular eating habits, which then leads to absorbing too much energy from a single portion,” says Nordic Diet Apps’ founder  . The Nordic Diet Coach app helps people to understand the importance of having a regular meal rhythm and reminds you when to eat and to have healthy snacks. Each meal is photographed and assessed for its nutritional value using the application’s indicators. In this way the user is steered towards thinking about the qualitative choices he or she makes. Karlsson lost the 15 kilograms she gained after the birth of her first child using the app she developed. It helped her make better choices in terms of her food. Karlsson is now taking the Nordic nutritional recommendations to the UK and Ireland where the Nordic Diet Coach app is being tested. “Our philosophy is based on the Finnish ‘plate model’ which is not used anywhere else in the world. There are various types of food pyramids but Finland is the only country where we have a concrete example of how to eat healthy,” Karlsson says. This year the largest growth company event in the Nordics, Slush, has brought together approximately 2 000 startups and a total of about 14 000 visitors."

That’s 70 a minute, or more than one a second. Not only are they growing in volume but they’re also getting more sophisticated. “It’s no longer enough to play catch-up,” says  , executive vice president, consumer security. “Today the volumes are so massive you can’t do that anymore.” Using technologies based on artificial intelligence, behavioural detection and network reputation, the Helsinki-based company aims to stop viruses in their tracks as soon as they are detected. It’s 25 years since   was founded and in independent studies, it has regularly topped the rankings for protection against viruses, trojans and malware. The threats, which keep companies like F-Secure busy are essentially two-fold: cybercriminals intent on financial gain and governments engaged in surveillance. The vast majority of security issues still affect computers but mobile problems are developing fast. “Still far too many people haven’t woken up to security concerns,” says Konttinen. “They are unaware how their information such as bank details or Facebook username and password can be monitored because they are using an unprotected network.” “We guarantee that your net browser cannot be monitored and that you cannot be profiled, tracked or traced. We want to give you your privacy back,” says Samu Konttinen. The company sponsored an experiment in London this summer designed to demonstrate the dangers of insecure public Wi-Fi. The experiment, which was backed by European law enforcement agency Europol, involved a group of security researchers setting up a Wi-Fi hotspot. When people signed up to the terms and conditions, they agreed to give away their firstborn child for eternity. Six people signed up before the experiment was stopped. “We were originally just an antivirus company but today we also offer people a product for privacy protection,” says Konttinen. “We guarantee that your net browser cannot be monitored and that you cannot be profiled, tracked or traced. We want to give you your privacy back.” To that end, F-Secure has been teaming up with mobile operators and fixed line operators. More than 200 operators worldwide and most of the biggest use F-Secure products to protect their clients. Konttinen says     surveillance  “It is very positive for F-Secure, coming from a rather independent and neutral country with strict privacy laws. Many companies are asking themselves can we trust a Russian security company and can we even trust these very reputable American security companies which have to release information when the government asks.” “Three years ago, being a Finnish company didn’t mean so much. Now suddenly it is very, very important.” Today, F-Secure has about 1 000 employees in more than 25 countries and posts annual revenues of 150 million euros. Most of its business comes from Europe and North America but the Latin American market is growing fast."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/irofit-ready-to-transform-mobile-card-payments-in-developing-countries/,Irofit ready to transform mobile card payments in developing countries,"Finnish mobile payment startup Irofit has developed a platform for processing card payments in real-time even without an Internet connection. With a recent 600 000 euro funding round the startup aims to improve the operations of small businesses in the emerging markets. Despite only being founded in 2014, Finnish startup   is set to launch a unique mobile payments processing platform targeted specifically at emerging markets.  The platform allows small businesses to process card payments in real-time and manage their operations with a mobile phone. All they need is a free mobile app and an EMV-certified card reader. What sets Irofit apart from other mobile payment providers is that the platform can be used in areas where there is poor or even no internet connection. Instead of relying on the magic of the internet, Irofit’s technology transmits encrypted transaction data via existing GSM channels. “We are the first platform in the world to offer real-time mobile card payment processing without an Internet connection,” says Irofit founder and CEO  . “Our technology can be used anywhere where there is even the most basic GSM connection to make and receive calls. Basically it means we can expand the geographic coverage of card payments three to five times to what it is with traditional payment terminals.” “Our mission is to build products that help small businesses across emerging markets to grow and do better for themselves and their families,” says Omoniyi Olawale. It’s a value proposal that has raised the interest of investors. Irofit recently closed a seed round of 600 000 US dollars, led by Nordic early-stage VC firm Inventure. Other participants were  , a Finnish payment software developer, and Nigerian industry expert  . “It’s not only about the money we got, but the deep expertise our investors bring. Our investor from Nigeria has decades of experience in banking and financial services and has great networks in the market. On the other hand our Finnish investors are regional leaders in payments and venture capital,” explains Olawale. The investment will be used to finalise the development of the platform and to launch the service in Nigeria in early 2015. The first pilot tests in Nigeria will include 5,000 merchants. At the launch additional 95 000 devices will be rolled out to local merchants in cooperation with a major Nigerian financial institute. Olawale describes Nigeria as the biggest market in Africa with over 200 billion US dollars worth of card transactions done annually. In addition to payment processing, the mobile app will offer merchants business management tools like basic accounting, sales history and analytics, inventory management, payroll support, loyalty management and CRM. Currently Irofit is looking to hire additional developers to get ready for launching its mobile payment platform in Nigeria in early 2015. The idea for Irofit came to Olawale when he was visiting his native Nigeria a few years ago. Having lived in Finland for the past six years, he had become accustomed to being able to pay by card practically everywhere. However, in Nigeria he noticed that card payments weren’t accepted even in the biggest hospitals in the area and major reason for this was the lack of a reliable internet connection.  While queuing for an ATM, Olawale not only grew frustrated but also started mapping out a solution. “I’m a medical doctor by training, but I started doing lots of research on the topic and eventually convinced two engineers to start the company with me and build the solution,” Olawale explains. “Finland was a natural choice to locate the company: there is a lot of technical talent here for us to recruit for developing our platform and for ongoing R&D. Also Finland is internationally recognised for a high degree of trust and integrity, which makes it a great place to do business.” Currently Irofit has a team of four developers in its offices in Kuopio and Helsinki and is constantly looking for new talents.  The company is hiring more developers for its R&D in Finland and is also planning to establish operations in Nigeria. If the launch goes well, the next step for the company will be expanding its service elsewhere in Africa as well as India, South-East Asia and Latin America. Irofit is also considering opening up its payment APIs to enable other entrepreneurs and developers to benefit from the technology it has created. “We have built the whole platform from the ground up and are an ambitious company, but we can’t build all the possible products that could be integrated to our platform ourselves. This is an age where you don’t just keep things to yourself, but you use your product or software to help others to do what they want to do better,” says Olawale. “We are focusing on a huge market and our mission is to make life easier for people in those countries. For too long technology products that were developed for Western countries have just been imported into emerging markets. But the emerging markets represent the majority of the planet and they deserve products that have been designed for their specific needs.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-woman-who-wanted-to-break-etiquette/,The woman who wanted to break etiquette,"Eight years ago, HIM rock band soloist Ville Valo walked past Jenni Ahtiainen in the street. Inspired by the artist’s look, Ahtiainen designed an accessory for Valo and sent it to him. The next time Ahtiainen saw her accessory was when Valo made his entrance to Finland’s annual presidential Independence Day Ball, sporting a lace tiescarf around his neck. ”It was as like the world started to open up at that very moment. I had unloaded heaps and heaps of traditional ties, and seeing   was the kick that gave me direction. Although little did I realise then that my markets would be outside of Finland,” Ahtiainen says. The designer, then in her 30s, made a list of dozens of celebrities who she thought might want to wear her accessories. She picked around ten of them and sent them unique accessories with an eye to promoting her designs. All of the 10 celebrities included in the initial list are now  ’s customers. ”Music has always been an incredibly important part of this brand, from my personal life through to my designs,” Ahtiainen explains. “After all, visibility comes through the artists.” Today, Gtie produces individual neckwear, such as various alternatives to the traditional bow and tie, tiescarves and various jewellery as well as some clothing for women, men and children. Ahtiainen is a trained welder, but she also studied interior design and media technology for a while. However, when she got the idea for her own accessory brand, Gtie, she dropped out of the University of Art and Design Helsinki and established the company in 2006. With the right attitude and a bit of luck, Ahtiainen has come a long way. Gtie’s main materials are Finnish leather and Italian silk; sometimes also brass and knitted silver. ”I don’t shy away from contacting anyone. I can stop people in the street and say, ‘Hey, I have something that I’m sure you will like’,” Ahtiainen says with a laugh. Gtie has already caught the eye of a few foreign celebrities, too. Last summer, rap artist Snoop Dogg announced that he would place an order with Ahtiainen for a collection of headwear knitted from reindeer leather. Last week, Marilyn Manson received a package in Los Angeles thanks to social media. ”I posted an update on Facebook saying that I needed to make a quick delivery to LA. The post has been shared 290 times and viewed 45 000 times. Some 24 hours later the package was at Manson’s house,” says an amazed Ahtiainen. About a month ago, someone called Ahtiainen to ask her if she could receive a guest who was interested in her brand. The guest turned out to be  ’s son,  . ”Of course, Rohan arrived several hours late. I was so annoyed that I didn’t even expect him to show up anymore. When he finally did, we got on like a house on fire. I asked him how he could possibly know about my brand. He said he didn’t, but he knows  !” Thanks to her tenacity, Ahtiainen managed to get a 5000 euro special grant from the Finnish government in just two weeks to attend the American Music Awards 2013. She had been invited to ‘tie’ the celebrities parading on the red carpet. ”I decided that I would get there even if it meant selling my car, but the work itself was far from glamorous.” A year-and.-a-half ago, she participated in an event organised by Business Angels Finland and Finatex, pitching her brand to investors who, sporting their traditional ties, she feared would laugh her out. Then she realised she was there because the investors had money but no ideas. ”I thought that if I could get them to understand my idea, they would be potential investors in my brand. Because it so happens that my brand tends to divide opinion, also among investors.” “It’s important for me to be able to stand a hundred per cent behind what I do. And if I can’t get those people excited, no one can.” When Ahtiainen made an announcement in social media that she would go make her pitch, her customers started asking how they could support the brand financially. The pitching led to a co-operation agreement with the Invesdor crowdfunding service and Gtie managed to raise 300 000 euros in capital. Gtie recently opened a new store on Unioninkatu in Helsinki. The products are also available through Gtie’s online store. The brand has retailers in Berlin and Milan. Ahtiainen hopes that the next round of project funding will help her fully launch her brand globally. Gtie’s primary market is Germany, where Ahtiainen has several projects going on right now. Next spring, she will take on the British market, which appears to hold potential for Gtie accessories. Many years of hard work seems to be slowly paying off, even though, when it comes to the US, she is still waiting for that famous stroke of luck. ”I had never set my goals this high. Basically, I could stop any day and be happy with what I’ve accomplished,” Ahtiainen says. ”But of course I won’t stop.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-gamifies-employee-advocacy/,Finnish startup gamifies employee advocacy,"What started as a passion project of three university friends has grown to an international business with 15 employees which works with brands like LinkedIn and Ernst & Young. It all stems from employee advocacy. The significance of social media for company communications keeps growing. However encouraging employees to be active brand advocates in social media is not necessarily an easy feat. This is what the Finnish software startup Smarp aims to change. “Already when we were working with our first customers, we realised that the most important resource in social media for companies is their own employees,” says  , co-funder and CEO of  . “That is when we started thinking about employee advocacy.” For Smarp employee advocacy means encouraging employees to participate in a company’s communications and to share professional content to their social media network. Through its employee advocacy platform ‘Smarpshare’ the company wants to facilitate the discovery and sharing of content in a gamified and fun way. Companies can use the platform to collect all of their sharable content in one channel, alert their employees of new content and measure their success in social media. Employees can easily share the content, gain points for being active and earn rewards. These can be anything from real-life prizes to choosing a charity for the company to support. “Employees can also suggest content to be shared. We want to give the employees an easy way to influence how, where and when the company communications are done,” comments Smarp COO and co-founder  . It has been a steep learning curve for Heinilä and Lauharanta who started the company in 2011. Their first social media marketing customer, an Australian wine region, was a great reference for the two man startup to start offering social media training for Finnish companies. One customer dubbed Smarpshare “the iPhone of employee advocacy software” because of its ease of use. Smarp believes usability gives it a competitive edge in the US market where competitors are emerging. It was cooperation with the global engineering company Metso that lead to the creation of their first online product, a web-based training service. Although the service was doing well, it wasn’t enough for Heinilä and Lauharanta. “Out of Metso’s 30 000 employees around 7 000 had a LinkedIn account. That meant over 250 000 unique contacts,” says Heinilä. “We realised that if we could motivate a company’s own employees to share the company’s content, they could reach much wider audiences and in a more personal way. That is when we got the idea for Smarpshare.” The big break for the startup came in December 2012 when the former CEO of the market research giant TNS Gallup   got interested in the company. After visiting Smarp in Finland, Ros decided to invest 100 000 euros in the company and became its Chairman of the Board. His involvement meant that Smarp was able to hire more people and focus on building the new platform. In early 2014, after a second seed round, the platform was ready for full commercialisation and the company has been growing ever since. In addition to a team of 12 in Helsinki, the company has sales representatives in the UK, Singapore and Dubai and customers in all of these countries. Currently Smarp focuses on European markets, but it is also interested in Asia and the US where the company already has some trial customers. Smarp’s R&D remains in Finland, though the company wants to have sales presence in every country where it has major customers. “Finland offers great infrastructure and plenty of high-level expertise, which makes it a good place for product development,” comments Heinilä. “The support we have received from the likes of Tekes [the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation] and Aalto Start-up Center has enabled our fast growth.” “Our platform is very scalable and bring benefits to anyone from small startups to global giants, no matter where they are located. But we have to focus our sales efforts somewhere and that is on big companies.” The ambitions are high. Heinilä and Lauharanta believe that in five years the market will reach a mature stage where most companies are using employee advocacy software. They want to see Smarp grow to be one of the global leaders in that multi-billion dollar market. “Our growth has been tremendous, but this is just the start for us,” concludes Heinilä. Smarpshare is not meant for controlling but for giving employees more freedom. “I have always believed that if companies trust their employees and give them more freedom in social media, great things will happen,” says co-founder Mikael Lauharanta."

A pilot project at the Summa Akron City Hospital in Ohio is yielding positive feedback while participation in the Global Access programme of the UCLA Anderson Business School, where final year MBA students are working with the company, has generated leads from interested hospitals in California. “We are targeting mainly private maternity clinics and those public hospitals which are progressive in their methods,” says  , vice president of  . “These exist in some European countries, in the US and in the Gulf states.” The Relaxbirth Birthing Support Device has been designed so that women can find the most comfortable position to give birth. They are able to change position quickly and feel in control all the way through labour. “Mothers report that they really are active participants in the childbirth process, not like the passive, helpless patients they felt when giving birth in a traditional way,” says  , CEO of Relaxbirth. “We are targeting mainly private maternity clinics and those public hospitals which are progressive in their methods”, says Marianne Ehrnrooth, Vice President of Relaxbirth. The motorised device comes with a movable seat, a back and leaning support and handles, which are easy to grip.   Relaxbirth provides training and services for staff in client hospitals. The Relaxbirth chair was the brainchild of Finnish midwife,  , and based on her experiences in Finland and abroad. The device has been used in Finland for several years and is now expanding its reach. Summa Akron City Hospital is the first maternity unit in the United States to use the device.  Patients and staff are determining its ease of use in a pilot study and their experiences are compared with those of mothers who gave birth in a standard hospital bed. In September 2013, Relaxbirth and Atlas Medical, one of the leading medical technology providers in the United Arab Emirates signed a distribution agreement for Relaxbirth childbirth equipment sales for maternity hospitals in the UAE. In September, the company moved into a new business park in Helsinki where GE Healthcare has set up a “Health Innovation Village” to allow local health tech start-ups to network, innovate and grow. “We can share ideas and network much more efficiently with other companies,” says Ehrnrooth.” There are plenty of potential synergy benefits.” The company expects to take on additional staff when it rolls out the new version of its Relaxbirth Birthing Support Device based on feedback from users and the medical community. Relaxbirth has received both Finnish and international awards including a 2012 Red Herring Top 100 Global Winner Award for promising new companies while its inventor Eija Pessinen was named Inventor of the Year 2009 by The European Union Women Inventors and Innovators Network (EUWIIN).

They continue to release new services to drive world-wide growth. The British colony of Hong Kong returns to China. Microsoft bails out a struggling Apple Computer. Every radio is playing  ’s   remake in memory of  . The year is 1997, and the Finnish company   releases a product for the electronic processing of invoices. “Basware has been the forerunner in the business for 30 years, and has to some extent invented e-invoicing,” says  , chief marketing officer for the company. Basware was founded in 1985 and specialises in financial software. Over the years it has released many cutting edge products, from budgeting software to electronic invoices. To stay competitive in the brutal business-to-business marketplace they are still coming up with new services. “In September 2014 we announced the launch of Basware’s Financing Services, which provides new and innovative financing services for buyers and suppliers, combining payment with financing services for companies of all sizes,” says Muddiman. “It is designed to optimise cash and working capital through digital participation in the Basware Commerce Network.” The Basware Commerce Network is an open ecosystem that helps connect buyers, sellers and other partners. It connects e-invoicing and e-ordering networks and has already tallied over 80 million transactions. “The foundation of our business is e-invoicing and automating procurement and payment processes within and between organisations. When the economy is tough companies are looking for ways to decrease costs. Automating financial processes are an effective way to do so,” Muddiman explains. Electronic invoicing is still relatively uncommon, but it is becoming more popular. MasterCard and Basware conducted a joint survey of over 1,000 global financial officers and discovered one in four had already automated their invoice processes. However, 43 per cent said they would focus more on e-invoicing so the company sees a major growth opportunity. “We have a market leadership position already in the Nordics, Germany and the Benelux region. We connect over one million active organisations across more than 100 countries so we are already “global” in many ways. The company will also continue to support organic growth and will continue mergers and acquisitions in order to drive the consolidation of the e-invoicing market in Europe and North America,” Muddiman continues. Muddiman sees a number of reasons why the use of electronic invoicing is rising, including a growing realisation of the cost and efficiency benefits, a supportive infrastructure and regulatory standards. “E-invoicing has increased significantly, especially during the last two–three years,” he observes. “That growth will undoubtedly continue and at some point in the future it will be ubiquitous. We absolutely see e-invoicing becoming business-as-usual, the same way as the Internet and mobile phones are business-as-usual today compared to the situation 10 years ago.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/beibamboo-aims-to-create-the-best-baby-outfits-in-the-world/,Beibamboo aims to create the best baby outfits in the world,"Finnish company Beibamboo creates baby outfits with a difference. They have patented hidden seams, use environmentally friendly materials and have a line especially for hospitals looking after preemie babies. Now the company, born from a mother’s love for her premature daughter, is ready to take on international markets The idea for fully opening, almost seamless, skin-friendly baby clothing came to   founder   when she was taking care of her prematurely born baby girl seven years ago. “When she was treated in the hospital, I was surprised how unpractical the baby clothes were,” says Ignatius. “Especially since preemie babies are attached to all sorts of tubes and wires. Parents can’t even dress their own child. “I started to think about designing clothes from the point of view of what a baby needs.” “At the startup event Slush in Helsinki I was approached by an investor who had invested in the biggest childrens clothing online store in Germany. They will soon add our clothes into their selection,” says Ignatius. It took Ignatius a few more years to come up with the first Beibamboo baby clothes in the summer of 2010. Since then she has been developing the clothing line in conjunction with neonatal ward staff in Finland and released two clothing collections. One targeted at hospitals and one for all babies up to 2.5 years old. Beibamboo’s hospital range has been designed neonatal intensive care units in mind and all the clothes can be fully opened. This enables parents to dress their babies themselves as no tubes or cannulas need to be removed. The design has brought some surprising benefits. “Since none of the tubes need to be detached, it reduces the risk of infection,” Ignatius says. “Dressing and undressing is also painless for the baby.” All the clothes are practically seamless, using the company’s own patented cover seams, labels are placed outside the garments to prevent scratching and the sizes are adjustable as babies grow. The designs are also aimed to be classic, rather than following any trend or seasonal fashion, to further extend their lifespan. It is this combination of carefully designed features that makes the clothes unique says Ignatius, who also stresses that their production is environmentally friendly. “The environmental aspect is also very important to me. We use organic cotton and bamboo in our clothes. Bamboo is soft for the skin and can be grown without fertilizers and pesticides.” Currently Beibamboo baby clothes are used in six hospitals in Finland and sold through the company’s own website and resellers in the Nordics. Ignatius also has international plans. One step on that road has been cooperating with General Electric’s Health Innovation Village in Helsinki, where the company’s office and team of five are now located. According to Ignatius, US-based GE is the world’s biggest supplier of incubators also giving Beibamboo access to hospitals globally. Beibamboo has just launched a Kickstarter campaign to speed its internationalisation. As a part of the campaign, the company will donate their baby clothes to neonatal intensive care units in different countries. “The US is an attractive market for us due to its size and the contacts we have,” says Ignatius. “. And in Europe, our clothes have been recently been picked up by Germany’s biggest online children’s clothing store. “Of course the Nordics are a natural market for us, but our clothes can be used everywhere. We have even received some enquiries from China.” Beibamboo’s expansion plans are supported by a newly launched  . The aim is to get visibility for the brand and to raise funding for further product development and marketing. As a part of the campaign, the company will donate their baby clothes to neonatal intensive care units in different countries in exchange for donations. The campaign has a familiar face.   singer  , father of prematurely born twins, is promoting Beibamboo in the company’s video. Prior to starting Beibamboo, Ignatius had a 15 year career as a graphic designer. She admits changing careers was daunting but is driven by the desire to help new parents. Recognition for her work is growing and last year Ignatius was chosen on the international   list, popularised by Forbes. “Even though building a clothing brand without any previous experience has been tough at times, I have mostly slept well at night because I believe I’m helping to make people’s lives better, “Ignatius says. “If I can also create a commercial success that employs lots of people in good working conditions [around the world], I will be proud of my legacy.”"

Merus Power offers clean technology to improve power quality, energy efficiency and environmental performance. Although multinational companies operate in the same business area, managing director   says Merus Power can offer a tailor-made service. — We have selected our market niche in power quality and we put all our efforts into that particular problem so we have a specific know-how and good problem-solving capabilities. Merus Power operates in a variety of sectors including wind and solar, mining oil and gas, textiles and data centres. The solutions it offers range from stabilizing voltage to mitigating harmonic distortions. Harmonics are electric voltages and currents on an electric power system, which can cause power quality problems. One recent project, which exemplifies how the company operates, was for the underwater diamond mining operations for De Beers off the coast of Namibia. Merus Power operates in a variety of sectors including wind and solar, mining, oil and gas, textiles and data centres. The project was initiated by a local partner as Merus Power always works with local partners abroad. Engineers were reporting that the variable speed drives operating the pumps used for drenching were causing high harmonic distortions – high enough to result in the overload of the whole electrical system. Merus Power shipped a filter to South Africa to coincide with the vessel’s dry docking schedule in Cape Town. Nine months since the device was installed, harmonic distortions have been reduced to virtually nil and mining operations are now running smoothly at the vessel without any unexpected and costly disruptions. Merus Power has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years. Last month, the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 programme, which lists the fastest growing technology companies in Finland, ranked it fourth on its Rising Star list. Revenues have grown 571 per cent over the last three years. With investments in research and development now bearing fruit, the company is focusing increasingly on global expansion and sales. Turnover was three million euros in 2013 and is expected to be nearly five million next year. Merus Power is chasing a five- to tenfold increase by 2017-18. “Now is the time to get the brand recognized and establish long-term customer and partner relationships,” says Tuomala. The company is also pinning its hopes for new business on a patented system it has developed, aiming at protecting emission critical processes from voltage dips and power failures for a short period of time."

I’d define myself as future-minded,” he states. “As a designer I try to imagine digital things that don’t exist yet. How they behave, how people would feel about them, and why they would make a difference. As a humanist I try to imagine how these interactive intelligent artefacts might affect people and their environment.” Many entrepreneurs identify a need and then build a company to fulfil that need. Koponen did something similar with Random, but instead of beginning with a service or product he started with his philosophy. “If you read the same things everyone else is reading, you start thinking like everyone else is thinking,” he says. “I come back to diversity. It’s crucial for creativity, for happiness, for humanity.” Random is an iOS mobile application which discovers online content via anonymous web browsing with a predictive discovery engine. You open the app to find a mosaic of possible topics to read about. It might be ‘fitness,’ ‘time,’ ‘men,’ or ‘storytelling,’ for instance. What you find depends upon the app’s sophisticated artificial intelligence and a healthy dose of chance. The Random app wants to pleasantly surprise you with what you can find online. “Marketing-driven personalisation engines are killing diversity in our daily digital environments by turning them into filter bubbles full of listicles and obtrusive advertisement,” Koponen explains. “We only see the things that are coming from our friends and like-minded people.” He believes that there is a need for new tools and techniques which take us beyond what we already know, and which exposes us to different opinions and ideas. This, he says, feeds the curiosity which defines us as human beings. The company is backed by Skype founder  . Currently they have a crew of seven based in Helsinki. “Our multinational team is a combination of designers, humanists and data scientists,” continues Koponen. “The diversity actualises in our everyday discussions. We all have our own take of the future of the digital environments and artificial intelligence so we tend to have very lively discussions about the topic.” The Random team has big plans for the future, and they realise that Random can be more than a content-discovery app. “In the bigger picture, we’re creating a human-centred artificial intelligence that could make any information interface more adaptive. Think that your phone, laptop or smartwatch would adapt to you and simultaneously could provide you positive surprises.” Random’s idea is to expose people to diversity by presenting alternative connections and paths. “By doing this it also opens up your personal future horizon,” Koponen says. “. If a person uses Random to embrace diversity she could potentially become more open towards different ideas, opinions and world views. Unexpected surprises make you happier than expected rewards or results.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/8342/,Blueprint Genetics disrupts genetic diagnostics testing and targets US,"Almost five per cent of the world population is affected by a hereditary disease, says Finnish biotechnology company Blueprint Genetics. The company has developed a high-quality and cost-efficient professional genetic test to ensure that these diseases are diagnosed correctly.  has a mission: the biotechnology company wants to raise professional genetic testing to a new level. One year ago Blueprint released its first genetic diagnostic tests for inherited cardiovascular disorders and with 80 hospitals in 15 countries already signed up the company is off to a strong start. The test is based on the targeted sequencing method developed by Finnish biologist and Blueprint Genetics co-founder   during his postdoctoral studies at Stanford University in the United States. The test uses a molecular biology approach called ‘Oligonucleotide-Selective Sequencing’ to efficiently analyse patients’ DNA. Myllykangas’ neighbouring laboratory happened to be occupied by two fellow Finnish doctors,   and  . Both recognised the benefits of the new technology in clinical use as many diseases are the result of hereditary changes in the DNA. Between them Blueprint Genetics was born and founded in 2012 when the trio returned to Finland. Blueprint’s first genetic test was launched in 2013. “How the process works is that when a patient or a family suspected to have a hereditary disease visits their doctor, a blood sample is taken and delivered to us for analysis,” explains Blueprint Genetics CEO  , who joined the company early on. “As genetic testing technology has become more complex, hospitals more and more prefer to outsource the testing instead of relying on their own laboratories”, says the CEO of Blueprint Genetics Tommi Lehtonen. “We provide the clinician with our analysis through our web service. The results can be used to determine the right treatment for the patient and to better understand the development of the disease.” Blueprint Genetics is not without competitors but stands out in the crowd by offering a high diagnostic hit rate, fast lead times and cost-efficiency combined with clinician-friendly analyses. “When we launched our test, genetic tests typically cost around 3,000 euros and took several months to analyse,” says Lehtonen. “Our average price is 1 300 euros and the lead time for all our tests is three weeks. Some of our competitors might offer low costs or fast analyses, but we are the only one who has been able to combine all of these elements. “It’s a great sign that our customers in Canada prefer to send their samples to us in Europe instead of using companies in the US.” Blueprint Genetics’ unique offering has also raised the interest of investors. In August the company closed its latest funding round bringing total funding to approximately three million euros. The company’s existing investors Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, and Finnish business angels were joined by the early-stage venture capital company Inventure as well as Avohoidon Tutkimussäätiö, a Finnish foundation. Blueprint Genetics, which employees 13 people in Helsinki, has a clear plan to use the funding to accelerate its internationalisation. Currently the company’s main markets are in Sweden, Canada and Finland, but the biggest fish is found across the pond: the more mature genetic testing market in the US. The company’s first office outside Finland has already been set up on the West Coast and will secure its sales license in the US during the first months of 2015. “Our main push this year has been starting operations in the US,” explains Lehtonen. “The funding will be used to grow our operations there as well as our whole organisation. Naturally we will also focus on further development on the technological side.” Genetic tests for consumers have been gathering lots of visibility in recent years, but Lehtonen emphasises that consumer and clinical tests are two very different beasts. “They have very different technologies and operational logic,” he says. “Consumer tests don’t offer the quality and detail that is needed in clinical tests. However, they are getting people interested in their genetic history which is a positive thing. “We believe that with time and advances in technology and regulations, in 10 years or so, the professional and consumer markets in genetic testing will converge. Then it would be possible for us to do something in the consumer space.” But for now the next step for Blueprint Genetics is developing tests for other diseases beside the pilot group of cardiovascular diseases. Its technology could potentially be used for any hereditary diseases and that is exactly where the company’s ambitions lay. “The major part of clinical genetic testing market is focused on cancer testing,” explains Lehtonen, who points out there are more than 3 500 inherited diseases. “The genetic testing for other diseases is an under-developed market. Which is why we want to be the leading global company in clinical genetics testing for all other hereditary diseases.” Blueprint Genetics has already customers in 15 countries but its next major step is expanding to the US market."

Friman points out that Weiste isn’t even trying to compete in price with products coming from countries with cheap workforce, and hence the company’s selection doesn’t include simple, one-coloured baubles. “Basic items are more or less the same, no matter who produces them,” Friman says. “We offer products that have been developed further.” Many consumers are willing to pay for Finnish products despite the price tag. Weiste has been the only producer of Christmas decorations in the Nordic countries for a good while. “Basic items are more or less the same, no matter who produces them. We offer products that have been developed further,” says Helena Friman. “Being Finnish and European is of increasing importance. Most of our competitors come from other corners of the world, so customers really do pay attention to the words ‘Made in Finland’.” The number of employees varies throughout the year. Garlands and lametta are manufactured in Pukinmäki, Helsinki, and hard products such as baubles in Hanko. Most of the decorations are made in Finland, but some products are put together in Estonia. Most of the work is done by hand. “In spite of our attempts, many phases in the processes can’t be mechanised,” Friman says. “Using machines would compromise the appearance of the products.” Friman can’t see Weiste ever moving its production away from Finland. She’s noticed that Finnish products are internationally deemed to be of high and steady quality; and as a family business, Weiste cherishes its traditions. Members from four generations of the family have made a living working for the company. It’s hard to imagine that sharing a home country with Santa Claus himself would be a disadvantage for a Christmas-related company. Friman admits that although at times the original birthplace of Santa is contested, Weiste holds on to the idea of him being of Finnish origin. The company itself doesn’t actively use Father Christmas in its marketing, but resellers are intrigued by the link between Finland and Santa Claus. Although now is the busiest time of the year for Santa, people at Weiste have moved onto the year ahead. The planning for Christmas 2016 starts in the beginning of 2015, as soon as the expo season is over."

There is an old saying in motorsports that if you want to win, you should hire a Finn.   of   decided to take that maxim from his racing days and applied it to luxury travel. “I used to be a professional snowmobile and jet ski racer in Europe and America;” Honkanen says. “I had an injury in Minneapolis in 1999, where I broke my heel, my hip and my back. As soon as I got back to Finland and healed I got an idea for a snowmobile school for children.” He set up his business at Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland. Over time wealthy families returned to Finland time and again, and they turned to Honkanen because he was so good with their kids and families. Janne Honkanen’s Luxury Action provides adventures for travellers. “Returning clients requested me to plan their entire holidays and customise all services, so I kind of accidently ended up arranging high-end holiday packages and later Luxury Action was born,” says Honkanen. “Currently we operate in Finland and all Nordic countries.” Luxury Action is not a typical tour operator. They offer custom experiences in travel, and as their name implies adventure is one of their specialities. Luxury Action has offered snowmobile safaris, kayaking, dog sledding, cruises on ice breakers and a trip to the North Pole. But even the most hardened adrenalin junkie needs to relax, so the company has provided private meetings with Santa Claus, Nordic cuisine from renowned chefs and accommodation in ice igloos. If sleeping under a dome of ice is not your style, Luxury Action has other options. “We manage exclusively a number of properties as the most exclusive private ranch in the Nordic countries,” Honkanen says. Luxury travel is a well-established industry, but Honkanen offers an unusual service which he calls the Hollywood Experience. The client comes up with a story idea which Luxury Action creates as a movie. Some examples they give as inspiration are action adventures, car chases, fantasy movies or even reality shows like Deadliest Catch. Such a movie doesn’t come cheap: the cost is 10,000 – 20,000 euros per week with a one week minimum. “The Hollywood Experience is a good, new and unique travel experience for wealthy families who want to offer an experience for their kids and grandchildren,” Honkanen explains. “The narrative can include the latest movie fairy tale or characters. You can live your dream.” For those with a dream of motorsports glory, it might pay to remember that adage of hiring a Finn to win. “If a client wants to experience ultimate driving: back in August we had two-time F1 World Champion   and a very rare Mercedes-Benz rally car on a Finnish rally road,” Honkanen points out. The Finnish company Luxury Action provides bespoke adventures for travellers to the Nordic region."

Helena’s Goodies is a bakery and café that offers Nairobians Finnish delicacies. The company’s objective is to be part of the first wave of Kenya’s emerging café culture. In early 2014,   went to Kenya for a month’s holiday with his family. They spent time, among other things, on a safari organised by the former middle-distance runner  . Kirwa is originally from Kenya but now lives in Finland. The Jaakkola family fell in love with Kenya and the local people. After their return, Kirwa, their next-door neighbour in Lahti, came by to get feedback on the safari and the trip to Kenya in general. Entranced by the country, Jaakkola jokingly said that he could very well imagine working there. Kirwa told him that it could be arranged: there would most definitely be a demand for the products of  , the bakery owned by the Jaakkola family. “In October, we founded a company named Helena’s Goodies in Kenya,” Jaakkola says. “We are renting bakery facilities with an adjacent café in Nairobi. It all began with a joke, and look at us now: here we are working at full steam.” The Jaakkolas decided to go to Kenya with the same products that make up their Finnish offering. Helenan Kotileipomo specialises in deep-fried bakery products, such as doughnuts and meet pasties. The latter have been very well received by Kenyans. Helena’s Goodies is located   minutes from Nairobi’s centre. The recipes were not adapted for Kenya, but some of the products were renamed. For example, cinnamon rolls became Maasai’s ears. It was Kirwa who came up with the name, as the cinnamon rolls distantly reminded him of his Kenyan father’s stretched ear lobes. “We also added some products to our offering that were not successful in Finland, like certain types of bread, for example,” Jaakkola says. “These products have proved to be highly popular in Kenya.” Helena’s Goodies in Nairobi currently employs two local people full-time and a Kenyan partner who owns 16 per cent of the company, as does Kirwa. According to Jaakkola, Nairobi’s bakeries are primarily owned by locals and focused on selling bread. There are cafés, too, but these are largely frequented by the Westerners living in the city. “However, Kenya’s economy is growing at a tremendous pace and,  due to this development, the locals are also slowly warming to the café culture, which presents us with a clear niche,” Jaakkola explains. The expansion to Kenya has not been without its challenges, though. Due to problems with the local customs authorities relating to importing bakery equipment from Finland, the company has not yet been able to start bakery operations at full capacity. This has not discouraged the family business. “Our dream is to expand in Kenya and establish more cafés in the country,” Jaakkola sums up."

The Aus Finnland music project will target German, Austrian and Swiss music fans, industry professionals and press. The project, which spans all music genres, aims to boost opportunities for artists from Finland and create a sustainable base for the future of music exports. It seeks to increase the number of new openings, projects and contracts as well as the number of shows and performances of Finnish music in these markets. The   website will list every single show by Finnish artists in the region and provide editorial content about Finnish music in German. “It is not just a one-way export project but the start of a long-term relationship,” says  , head of international music export at  , which promotes awareness and the success of Finnish music at home and abroad. “People seem to think Finland is only about heavy metal or classical music but these days all different styles of music are very much alive,” says Sami Häikiö. The association represents different sectors of the industry, including copyright societies, record companies, publishers, music makers and performers. “We do a lot of matchmaking,” says Häikiö. “For example, we might bring international music business people to Finland to certain events where we showcase Finnish artists.” Music Finland reckons the current market value of Finnish music exports is about 36–37 million euros.The figure includes sales, concerts and international license agreements. The highest turnover is in Europe and the Nordic countries followed by the United States and Japan. Abroad, Finland is recognised for renowned conductors and composers like  . In addition the country has become widely known for its heavy metal and hard rock music following the victory of Lordi  the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/artwave-wants-everyone-on-waves/,Artwave wants everyone on waves,"Finland’s reputation as a surf country skyrocketed last autumn – all because of one wave. The first artificial Artwave was surfed on in October, and now Artwave wants to spread the joys of surfing all over the world. In the autumn of 2011,   voiced out loud a crazy-sounding idea at Aalto University’s Design Factory. Would it be possible to create both artificial and mobile waves in Finland, a country full of unsurfable water? “People in high places have told us this isn’t going to work,” says Andersen, the coordinator of the project. “That’s the best possible sign that we’re on the right path.” Fortunately there were believers, too. Soon the gang was testing the waters in a children’s pool at the Espoonlahti swimming pool – after hours, of course. “After a lot of effort, the scale model started forming a magical view: a rising wave,” Andersen reminiscences. “That’s where it all started.” By spring 2012   had been accepted into Aalto University’s entrepreneurship programme, an invention announcement had been submitted, and patenting was on the cards. The quick pace of development was acknowledged by the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation Tekes, and it provided Artwave with funding in the spring of 2013. Last October an Artwave was surfed for the first time. “It was a happy and humble moment,” says Andersen. “In sports terms, we scored a goal at an important moment.” A huge group of people has been involved in Artwave, from Finnish surfers to frequency changer providers. It has also offered a topic for four academic dissertations. 
Andersen describes the technique as simple. The machine aims at maximising the water’s tendency to create waves. Learning to surf with the help of a machine is safer than in natural waves, where streams, tides, pollution, animals, and other surfers need to be taken into account. “People who build ships want to decrease wave-making resistance, we want to increase it using as little energy as possible.” The ultimate goal is to make surfing more accessible to all age groups. Out in the world the sport is popular, and according to Andersen, it’s ”one of the finest forms of exercise”. “Does surfing appeal to a teenager more than many other sports? If this gets young people more into exercising, we’re onto something big.” Andersen compares Artwave to ski lifts at ski resorts. Learning to surf with the help of a machine is safer than in natural waves, where streams, tides, pollution, animals, and other surfers need to be taken into account. Surf parks with their artificial pools are already in existence. What makes Artwave different is its mobility. The machine is easy to install and it’s planned for natural waters, so there’s no need for big investments. The waves can be customised. The only requirement is a large enough, 4-metre deep area of water and a sturdy beach. Access to an industrial energy source is a bonus. Energy consumption is kept to a minimum in all possible ways. Andersen points out that the consumption is surprisingly small to begin with, because making waves comes naturally to water. “We create waves together with the water by listening to what it tells us about its movements.” The point is to leave no trace in nature. When the machine is removed, the area is as it was. What if a Saimaa ringed seal is nesting nearby? “We simply refuse to surf in vulnerable waters,” Andersen says. Andersen calls Artwave a masterpiece of Finnish engineering. The whole idea has a slice of Finnish insanity in it, as well as the way in which it connects with the natural environment. “There are no waves in Finland, but we want to go surfing. We don’t stay around wondering what to do; instead, we make a wave machine.” Artwave wants to go global. The recipe is simple: “We ship the product to its destination with two quiet blokes. They set things up, tell a local surfer to give it a go, adjust the settings, and get out a perfect wave. Then they grab a bite to eat and go home. If something breaks down, they come back and fix it.” Potential customers are event managers, holiday and ski resorts, and city councils. The interest has been keener abroad than in Finland. Currently Artwave is looking for partners, planning the next stage in development, and negotiating additional funding. Andersen himself wants to catch a wave or two, too. For him, surfing is a huge deal. “I got on a surfboard once, and everything started to look different.” A huge group of people has been involved in Artwave, from Finnish surfers to frequency changer providers.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pilvi-transforms-e-commerce-for-cloud-services/,Pilvi transforms e-commerce for cloud services,"The cloud is now an integral part of everyday business, but for companies providing cloud services reaching customers can still be challenging and time consuming. This is something Finnish startup Pilvi hopes to change with its new e-commerce platform.  (‘cloud’ in Finnish) was founded in 2013 on the realisation that many local cloud service providers were struggling in a market increasingly dominated by global giants such as Amazon and Google. Instead of fighting these giants, Pilvi cleverly partnered with them and many others and created the ‘Pilvi Shop’ online store builder which was launched in August 2014. “What we wanted to offer is a platform and tools to build and manage a cloud services marketplace,” explains Pilvi’s sales director  . “Cloud service providers can expand their own service offering by brokering Cloud services from other providers from all around the globe. “There are plenty of e-commerce platforms that are built for the sale of physical products, but not for cloud services.” But Pilvi isn’t only about helping local cloud services providers sell global services, like Amazon and Google hosting. It also embraces local services. Pilvi customers can both sell their own services and even make them available to be resold through other service providers’ Pilvi -powered online stores In addition the effect of the Pilvi Shop is potentially dramatic. Rather than having to invest in building their own online store from scratch, a cloud service provider can use the Pilvi Platform to open their own branded online store within a few days. Pilvi believes that merging global and local cloud services and sales can drastically lower the barrier for service providers opening online stores while also helping them widen their product offerings. Their customers benefit by being able to purchase and manage variety of Cloud services through one channel. They also have access to local support if problems arise. At present Pilvi believes this is a unique offering. So far the company has only found one close competitor who approaches cloud services e-commerce from a slightly different focus. “Their online stores can only sell the so-called ‘SaaS layer’ (Software as a Service), while our platform also covers hosting and capacity services, known as the ‘IaaS layer’ (Infrastructure as a Service),” Vehosmaa explains. “We offer the whole buffet of cloud services instead of focusing on just SaaS. The market response to this has been very positive.” Unsurprisingly Pilvi with its Espoo-based team of 10 employees is now eyeing international markets and the UK and Central Europe are first on the expansion list with the US to follow. Key to this will be Pilvi’s planned upgrade to its own online store which will greatly increase the speed of deployment for new customers. Who will these customers be? Currently Pilvi’s primary focus is medium-sized cloud service providers, but discussions have been active with a number of other companies, including large teleoperators. That said Pilvi still believes that its unique merger of global and local services is what will be key to long term success. “There is no doubt that global giants will rule the cloud service market, but local companies won’t disappear. [Cloud service providers’] End users will always need local, trusted partners who offer personalised service and help in their own language and without delays. It’s quite hard to just call Amazon or Google, Vehosmaa summarises. “We think it is a realistic goal that in a few years hundreds of thousands, even millions, of end users will manage their cloud services through our platform.”"

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-startup-pursues-a-bigger-vision-for-health-tech/,Wellmo pursues bigger vision for healthtech,"Finnish health technology startup Wellmo was born out of two ex-Nokian’s passion for health and wellbeing. They have created a mobile platform to help companies improve the wellbeing of their employees. Some 10 years ago   was feeling the toll of a busy career. A sabbatical from his work at Finnish technology giant Nokia helped him improve his lifestyle and lose weight. Now, he wants to help others to lead healthier lives by making employee wellness programmes more personal. “About three-quarters of people already have some kind of personal wellness goals. But many feel that corporate wellness programmes aren’t for them because its focus might differ from their own goals”, says Olkkonen, co-founder and CEO of  , who previously lead Nokia’s wellness business. “We help employers to engage these people by asking them what are their own goals and how the wellness programme coaches can help in achieving that. “ In short, Wellmo is a cloud-based platform and mobile app for running employee wellness programmes. Health-focused corporate service providers, such as occupational health and coaching, can use Wellmo to offer companies bespoke campaigns, personal coaching and surveys. The Wellmo platform consists of three parts: tools for service providers to run wellness programmes, a mobile app for employees to track their wellbeing and aggregation of health tracking data from existing apps and devices. “So far companies haven’t been able to effectively measure the benefits of their wellness programmes,” believes Jaakko Olkkonen. “As we can provide them with measurable results, they will invest more in employee wellbeing.” Instead of offering yet another health tracker, Wellmo mobile app can gather data from over 30 wearables including Fitbit, Beddit, Garmin and Withings. This means Wellmo’s approach enables employees to use their prefered products as part of their corporate wellness programme. Employees can then use the data gathered through the Wellmo mobile app to set goals and chart their own progress while their wellness programme coaches can monitor the data and help them reach their goals. “Basically employers can cost-efficiently offer all of their staff a personal coach”, explains Olkkonen. For the employer Wellmo provides an overview of the well being of its staff and their measurable results in real time. The benefits of this can be significant with the company citing a recent article in the   which claims the return on investment for comprehensive well-run employee wellness programmes can be as high as six to one. Wellmo was born when Nokia’s own mobile wellness business was discontinued in 2012. Olkkonen and his colleague   left the company, licensed its ‘Mobile Wellness Diary’ technology and founded their own company later that year. For Wellmo, which now has 13 employees in its Helsinki-based headquarters, it was an easy choice to approach wellbeing from a service provider – rather than consumer – point of view. “We wanted to focus on the second phase of wellness technology where, instead of consumer products, these technologies will move onto a larger scale in different services,” says Olkkonen. “Measuring your own blood pressure is useful, but you will benefit much more when a health professional can use that data to provide a personalised service.” The start has been promising. While Wellmo was only officially launched in November 2014 it already has clients in Scandinavia, Benelux and the United Arab Emirates. For the time being the company’s target markets are Europe and the Middle East, with Olkkonen noting that the latter’s wellness culture is still in its infancy. Wellmo also has long term plans to move into public health care. The company believes that in the future wellness technologies will be more widely adopted also in the public sector and a service like Wellmo could be used as a preemptive method to monitor and improve health and potentially save millions in health care expenses. “Even though people still have a lot to improve in their lifestyles, there is a lot of drive to do so,” Olkkonen concludes. “But they will need professional help to reach their goals and we can help with that. Technology has already changed many areas in our lives and it will also change how we manage and develop our wellbeing.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/making-kanteles-is-music-to-luthier-s-ears/,Making kanteles is music to luthier’s ears,"Situated in a small town in Central Finland, a British luthier is creating the Finnish national instrument for a local and international clientele. How does an artist know when they have finished a painting? When does a writer sense that their novel is ready for an audience? With just an extra brushstroke or word, they may potentially reach an even more satisfying conclusion. For luthier  , however, the final touch when completing a kantele is more apparent. “I play the notes to make sure it’s in tune,” he reveals, after applying a finish of linseed oil. “I wouldn’t call it a song; it’s just a certain way that I play the strings.” This final stage of the process has been reached with increasing regularity, with Thompson’s one-man business,  , currently producing up to ten five-string kanteles on a weekly basis. Thompson makes a range of different kaneteles, with the traditional five-string model (left) being the most popular among his customers. Years ago in his hometown of Newark, UK, Thompson was content with the weekly rhythm of making guitars, having trained as a luthier. Nonetheless, an innocuous conversation one day with his Finnish wife   about instruments from her home country would draw him away from his guitar-orientated stock-in-trade. Made famous by the likes of the national epic  , and a prominent feature of Finnish folk music of yore, the kantele shares a similarity with the zither. Thompson was intrigued. “It seemed so interesting that Finland had its own instrument, then to try and work out how to make one on my own,” he recalls. One immediate stumbling block was the lack of information available in English on the topic. So, Thompson scoured the Internet, seeking out images with which he could approximate the instrument’s required measurements. “If there was a picture with someone’s hand in it I could then basically work out the size it was,” he recalls. “I would take a ruler and could see the kantele is that long and looks like it’s that wide. It was trial and error.” The luthier patiently fine-tuned his design until he had something playable in his hands. But this wasn’t enough; he wanted it to be exact. After the couple moved from England to the small Finnish town of Saarijärvi, near the city of Jyväskylä, the challenge of making a living amongst the picturesque lakes and forests became apparent for the newcomer. The solution? Thompson set up a small workshop attached to their home, establishing a business that specialised in producing the national instrument. Entirely self-funded, he gathered the basic tools he needed, drawing on local knowledge to finalise his design. Thompson completes each kantele by strumming the strings to ensure the instrument is in tune. “There was a string maker near me and he was able to tell me the exact measurements,” he explains. “I wasn’t far off. It will be five years this spring that the company’s been going.” Utilising locally sourced alder wood to create the kaneteles, the main market for Thompson’s wares is also found in Finland. However, his work continues to attract considerable interest from all around the world. “Countries like Germany and Japan have similar instruments, so they know about the kantele and they are interested in it. Then there are also countries like Australia and America, where people have Finnish heritage.” While Melodia Soitin’s most popular item remains the standard five-string model, Thompson makes a range of kanteles, including those with 10, 11 and 19 strings. In light of his future plans to gradually increase production and sell his kanteles to music shops, Thompson is extremely satisfied with what he has been able to achieve – somewhat against the odds – in small-town Finland. “It’s become a surprise success story,” he muses. “It’s been an amazing thing. I’ve been able to start my own business in a foreign country and have some money coming in for these instruments. I feel very lucky to get up in the morning, wander off to the workshop and build kanteles.”"

The project started in 2012 with a key focus in water and sanitation facilities. “It consists of a combination of short term practical and down-to-earth hygiene improvement and long-term enabler of children’s – and especially girls’ – right to education,” says  , senior vice president of sustainability development at Metso. “The schools were chosen for their proximity to our production plant in Rajasthan.” In rural India safe and clean toilets can make a real difference to girls’ school attendance. More than 300 million women and girls in India do not have access to safe menstrual hygiene products or clean toilets, which hampers their education. According to a recent survey by Nielsen and  , over one-fifth of Indian girls dropped out of school when they reached puberty. Plan India says it is important to educate the entire community about the basic needs of hygiene and sanitation. “We take a holistic approach in our programmes involving the entire community,” says  , senior programme manager at Plan India. “Our belief is that children can be the change agents, they can really achieve change.” Focusing on CSR makes long-term business sense as Metso believes companies managed in a sustainable way will have a greater business potential in the long run. “We try to manage a complex business environment, where CSR also has an important role to play – for our own people, for people around our facilities, and of course for our customers,” Ohlsson adds.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-whiskey-lifts-the-spirits/,Finnish whiskey lifts the spirits,"Good ideas take time to mature and the creation of the first private distillery in Helsinki for more than a century was no exception. Some 10 years after three friends –   and   from Finland and   from Ireland – first mooted the idea, they started their first distillations last August. This year they plan to produce 12 000 litres of barrel strength whiskey. By the time it matures in three years, the trio hope to have another still installed, quadrupling capacity to 50–60 000 litres. “Our goal is to produce top quality distillates because the only way we can compete with our products is through quality,” says Holohan. He points out that production is deliberately small scale and that   won’t be able to compete on price given the cost of production in Finland. In addition, the trio are disadvantaged by strict national alcohol laws, not least when it comes to advertising. It’s one of the reasons, they offer tours of the distillery as they are dependent on word-of-mouth. “Our goal is to produce top quality distillates because the only way we can compete with our products is through quality,” says Séamus Holohan. However, one thing the company is blessed with, are quality raw materials. Not only is the acidity of the water ideal, but there is no shortage of rye in Finland, which is used to supply the domestic beer industry with malt also exported to the distilling industry in Scotland and Japan. “It was an eye opener for us,” says Holohan. “Raw materials are produced here, then shipped over to Scotland and then imported back as a finished product a few years later.” “For excellent whiskey, you have to start with the best raw materials you can get. It is not like making wines where you are so dependent on soil type and climate. In Finland, when it comes to making whiskey, we can compete with the best in the world.” Around 70 per cent of taste and final colour comes from the barrel and while waiting for the whiskey to mature, the trio have diversified into producing gin and Applejack, a matured apple spirit. Helsinki Dry Gin has been available in restaurants and bars since January and has just hit Alko, the national alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly in Finland. The distillery is based in the   converted abattoir premises between the districts of Kalasatama and Sörnäinen, which have become a food cultural centre with a series of restaurants and specialist shops. “When the still is on for distilling, the excess heat produced by it can be used to heat a sauna in Teurastamo’s chimney,” says Holohan. Over 1.5 million litres of whiskey a year are currently sold at Alko and only 0.5 per cent of that is produced in Finland. The Finnish whiskey market is currently serviced primarily by Scotch blended whiskey. “We want to make something that is top quality and do it with pride, says Holohan.“That’s really the governing ideal of the company.” “For excellent whiskey, you have to start with the best raw materials you can get. In Finland, when it comes to making whiskey, we can compete with the best in the world,” says Séamus Holohan."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/swords-to-dinosaurs-meet-the-google-of-public-procurement/,Swords to dinosaurs: Meet the Google of public procurement,"Sometimes it takes being boring to be successful. This is what Ville Heinonen and Mikko Lehmuskoski have found after co-founding Oppex, the “world’s largest source of public procurement notices”.  Public procurement is a totally boring area for a startup which is exactly why we thought there must be something great about it,” says   CEO and co-founder   with a laugh. “Like that the public sector represents a 10 trillion-euro market globally.” In practice, Oppex is a global search engine for public procurement tenders. It helps companies to find sales opportunities from both local and international government contracts. For example a user types in a search word related to their industry and the results show all relevant tenders from over 100 countries. The service aggregates thousands of new public tenders daily and translates them to English from around 50 languages. This is exactly what gives Oppex a competitive edge compared to other similar services. “There aren’t many other global services in this field, but what makes us unique is that no one else offers English translations of public tenders. With our service, companies can find any public tender, no matter what the original language is, explains Heinonen. “Oppex suits especially small and medium-sized companies who don’t have the resources to go through public tenders in many different countries and languages.” It seems the company has found the right approach. Despite only being launched publicly in November 2014 (after a few years of testing) the service already has thousands of business users from 120 countries. Oppex has come a long way since 2009 when Heinonen and Lehmuskoski, who met 10 years earlier while studying together, started the company. The first iteration of the service was born three years ago – coded by Lehmuskoski himself. “During the first month of using the service, one of the test users found four interesting tenders from Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic. Four months later they had already closed one of the deals, worth 300,000 euros,” says Heinonen. “When we got similar feedback from other companies, we knew we wanted to take the service further.” The duo quit their day jobs to become full time entrepreneurs. Now Oppex employs 10 people in its headquarters in Helsinki and abroad and is constantly looking for new talent, from coders to digital marketers. “The next step for us is to speed up our internationalisation and marketing. Our aim is to be a globally well recognised company in our field within a few years,” Heinonen says. These ambitions are spurred on by a 1.2 million-euro seed funding from media company Alma Media, startup accelerator Veturi, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes, and seven angel investors. Oppex’s first marketing pushes will be targeted at the UK and Germany as they have been successful test markets for the company. However, as the public procurement process is very similar all over the world, potentially there is no limit to where the company can go. Oppex’s database currently includes more than 3.5 million public tenders and the company claims it’s already the world’s largest source of tenders. While traditional industries like healthcare and construction represent major areas of public procurement, the variety of tenders and business the company is seeing has taken Heinonen by surprise. “Sometimes it takes me a few minutes to even understand what a company does,” he laughs. “There are some amazing public tenders out there, it’s actually very interesting to go through them. We have seen everything from ceremonial swords and dinosaur playgrounds to champagne and caviar.” Maybe public procurement is not so boring after all. Remote work is a natural part of Oppex’s business culture as half of its employees live abroad. “We want to find the best people for us and that is more important than where they live,“ says Heinonen."

She established a fashion company named Dreams & Doors that manufactures ecological sportswear in the UK – and has decided to make it big. The thought had been smouldering in her for years: active in tennis and rowing in her student years, she wanted clothes which would make a sporty woman look classic and chic. The existing markets failed to respond to her need to look elegant and feminine in sportswear. “I want to offer people outfits that they can easily wear for a bike ride into town and for a drink after their sports session,” Hasan says. “I want to offer people outfits that they can easily wear for a bike ride into town and for a drink after their sports session,” Alisha Hasan says. The company is just in its infancy, but Hasan believes she is uncovering a gold mine. According to her, there are currently no other manufacturers using similar organic fabrics in their sportswear lines. Hasan designs her ecological sportswear pieces herself. The fabrics are imported from India and Turkey, among other countries, and the garments are produced in the UK. Hasan wants to support companies specialising in sustainable development and small British textile factories. “The fabrics are either herb-dyed, i.e. totally chemical-free, or OekoTex-certified, which means that the minor amounts of chemicals used in their manufacture do not cause any detrimental impacts on the environment,” Hasan explains. Producing ecological garments is neither low-cost nor easy. Due to the availability of the materials, Hasan needs to proceed in a reverse order compared to traditional fashion labels: she buys the fabrics first and then creates her designs, and not the other way round. Hasan describes her customer as a sporty career person aged 20 to 35 with an active life and a playful style. They are also quality-conscious and care about their health and the environment.   is a luxury brand which enjoys a large potential customer base at British sports clubs. “Also creating a men’s collection right off the bat was a strategic move, because market opportunities are certainly not in short supply when it comes to men’s fashion,” says Hasan. The first collection was launched last summer and the pre-sales of the spring/summer 2015 collection have been growing steadily among both customers and distributors. As of early summer, Hasan’s garments will be sold in London’s high-end Equinox fitness clubs, and the network of co-operation partners was further expanded at the   held in Berlin in January. “We had booked several meetings with local eco-fashion retailers during the fair. The purchaser of the German store Phasenreich and the founder of the Monagoo distribution channel visited the fair just so they could meet our team,” Hasan says. The ecological and chemical-free fabrics used by Hasan are imported from India and Turkey, among other countries. Raised in Finland, Hasan completed her Master’s degree in economic science in London. She thinks of the UK as her second home and lives in London. Establishing a company in the UK was a natural choice, as the largest markets for her products can be found outside of Finland. However, it is important for Hasan to let her Finnish roots and the Scandinavian aesthetics shine through in her designs: in her future collection she intends to use reindeer leather produced in Finland for its quality and unique characteristics. Hasan also wishes to collaborate with Finnish designers. She has already signed an agreement with  , an artist and graphic designer known internationally for her My Little Pony designs. “Mari will design a new dedicated character for D & D’s future collection which will be targeted especially at Japan and South Korea. We want to create a new kind of Finnish design identity, one that is more global and focused on detail,” Hasan says. “One of my favourite print designers is  , who created the Taika range for Iittala. Each of his pieces tells a story. I want to achieve the same expression in my garments, and I’m not likely to run out of stories and wild ideas anytime soon,” Hasan says, laughing."

Everyone knows that scene in   where the droid R2-D2 displays a holographic image of Princess Leia. It is a gripping scene because images floating in thin air are so otherworldly and futuristic. When shoppers see it happen in a Tampere mall they gather around, just as intrigued as Luke Skywalker was. But this isn’t a secret message from a fictional princess; this is the work of the Finnish company Fogio.  is their creation. The system generates a thin white fog onto which images are projected. It can display text, static pictures, moving images or combinations of the three. It is similar to a movie projector but the screen is an ephemeral slice of white fog. “It is basically created with electricity, water and ultrasonic technology. It is a very dry fog. You can walk through it and not get wet,” says  , sales manager for Fogscreen. Walking through the screen of fog is exactly what the people in Tampere want to do. They reach out and touch it, stand in it, and circle around to see how it works. The public’s curiosity makes the system a great advertising platform and is why the company created their “Ads in the Air” concept. “It is very effective as an advertising concept. People walk through these ads in the air; they engage with it and react to it. It shows up great in pictures. You can take pictures of the images and share the information on social media. It creates an exponential reach,” says Kurri. “It is very effective as an advertising concept. People walk through these ads in the air; they engage with it and react to it, ” says Ville Kurri, Sales Manager for Fogscreen. Fogscreen has found many more uses for their product than ads. A Polish art museum projected the history of Krakow on the screen of fog. The Elite Models agency used it for their models to walk through on the runway. Disney had the system on their Enchanted Tour and Bowl Circus installed it at the entrance to their bowling and entertainment centre. “The Harry Potter ride at an amusement park projected ghostly images on Fogscreen,” Kurri continues. The company currently has a staff of six. They sell and rent the Fogscreen device as well as work with partners with the “Ads in the Air” service which is based on a revenue sharing model. “The US is a big market. We also do a lot of business in Asia and Europe,” Kurri says. After running pilot projects with their advertising concept in Finland, Fogio is now taking their idea abroad. After an event in Seoul, Korea they are on their way to sunny Dubai."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/revolutionary-finnish-wellness-app-lands-usd-550k-and-jamie-oliver/,Revolutionary Finnish wellness app lands USD 550K and Jamie Oliver,"Finnish Fifth Corner gives an alternative to the quantified self trend and targets the fun and inspirational side of wellbeing. Its approach is backed by 550 000 US dollars of new funding – and Jamie Oliver. Helsinki-based Fifth Corner has moved fast. The company was only founded in 2014 as a spin-off from Finnish health technology startup Health Puzzle and already has attracted users from over 100 countries to an early access version of its   on iOS. “We wanted to take a more good-hearted approach to improving wellbeing,” says  , CEO and co-founder of Fifth Corner. “Our aim is to make health fun, inspirational and approachable as well as to promote the idea that small actions will lead to major change.” “We believe data-heavy measuring and dashboards can be useful for some, but do not inspire behavioral change in all of us.” Instead of measuring their every movement, the wellness focused YOU-app encourages its users to complete daily micro-actions The YOU-app promotes a healthy lifestyle through bite-sized daily micro-actions and only asks its users for a minute per day. Actions fall into four categories: food, love, mind and exercise and tasks vary from doing 10 squats to taking a minute for yourself to appreciate your environment or changing part of your evening meal. Users show they have completed their action by taking a picture of it and sharing that with their friends and followers. This approach makes the YOU-app stand out from the mass of existing fitness trackers and wellness apps focused on quantifiable data and measuring everything from steps and sleep to heart rate and calories. While lighthearted, the ideology of micro-actions is based in science. To create sustainable change, researchers and neuroscientists advocate small steps, rather than changing your whole life at once. “YOU-app started to take shape when we realised that the first challenge to solve is how to inspire people to change their behaviour,” explains Lähteenmäki . “We believe in micro-actions because change rarely happens overnight. Your wellbeing is the sum of all those small actions you take every day, and every choice you make is significant.” Moving away from data crunching fitness tech has also attracted international backers. Fifth Corner’s seed-funding round of 550 000 US dollars (approx. 450 000 euros) was led by London-based venture capital firm Wellington Partners and angel investors from the UK and Finland. Fifth Corner aims to use the funding mainly to boost product development as the company prepares to release the full version of its app for iOS and Android in the next few months. There are also plans to grow its existing team of nine engineers and designers during 2015. “We want to hone the app to its peak before full launch and we are also looking for a few more people to complement our great team,” Lähteenmäki explains. Despite its international approach Fifth Corner believes Helsinki will always remain home and its office location in Viiskulma means ‘five corners’. Nevertheless Lähteenmäki encourages a global perspective. “Helsinki has developed a lot as a startup hub, but it is still a good idea for startups to go outside Finland at an early stage to learn and build networks.” YOU-app is backed by Jamie Oliver who participates in developing its content. The celebrity chef has already been marketing the app to his 4.1+ million Twitter followers. Fifth Corner has one more ace up its sleeve. The YOU-app is backed by celebrity chef   and his team who are working with the company on the app’s content and user experience. Oliver, known for his passion promoting healthy living, has also been a vocal advocate of You-app regularly promoting it to his millions of followers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. “You-app has started off very well and a major factor in this is our partnership with Jamie,” Lähteenmäki says. “He has an incredible reach. There’s a large audience that appreciates him and loves his positive and inspirational way of doing things.” Fifth Corner was introduced to Oliver by one of its investors. Both share the same vision of inspiring people to take action towards a healthier lifestyle and the collaboration between the teams started quickly to advance YOU-app’s philosophy of “small things matter”. “It’s tragic that so many start the year with a resolution to change their lifestyles, but 90 per cent will fail because they have tried to bite off more than they can chew. Our team would like to see micro-actions to become the next big thing. “In the end, it’s the small decisions that matter the most.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sasu-kauppi-a-rising-star-of-finnish-design/,Sasu Kauppi – a rising star of Finnish design,"Known for his unique street fashion, Helsinki-based clothing designer Sasu Kauppi has sparked more interest abroad than in his home country. Nevertheless, he regards Finland as an inspiring setting for a creative entrepreneur like himself and would not want to live elsewhere.  Things are going well in the world of Finnish clothing design: the industry has started to gain international interest and is producing several promising fashion designers. These young talents tend to be eager to seek job opportunities abroad, and many of them have been employed by international fashion houses.   instead, wanted to do things in his own way. After graduating from London’s famous art university Central Saint Martins with a master’s degree in fashion, Kauppi decided to return to Finland and create his own clothing brand. But why would an up-and-coming designer do that? “Everybody keeps asking me that. In my opinion, Finland is a more inspiring country in comparison to Britain, and I love it here in Helsinki. I can easily travel everywhere that I need to go, so the whereabouts of my company do not matter,” Kauppi says. Sasu Kauppi regards Finland as an inspiring setting for a creative entrepreneur like himself and would not want to live elsewhere. Already during Kauppi’s London years, his urban streetwear outfits were praised by his professor  , who has taught some of the biggest international fashion gurus such as  . After founding his own brand in the autumn of 2011, Kauppi has designed and manufactured several small-scale collections in Finland. In the last two years, his clothes have been seen, for example, on the catwalks of Paris Fashion Week and Pre Helsinki. “I actually do not consider fashion design to be a form of art. For me, a piece of clothing is rather a tool for making my ideas and thoughts visible on the streets,” Kauppi highlights. Nowadays Kauppi spends most of his days at his design studio located in the industrial Jätkäsaari neighbourhood in Helsinki. Right now he is working on the autumn/winter 2015 collection with the help of his trainees. In addition, he acts as a design consultant abroad and teaches design at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture. According to Kauppi, his fashion is inspired by things that interest him – such as movies, sports, people that pass by on the street, or even by the Simpsons. In Finland, one can buy Kauppi’s products only at his annual sample sales. In fact, the largest markets for his clothing are far away from home. “My products are currently sold mainly in small boutiques and online stores in Asia, especially in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Japan. Moreover, I have got some sales in Britain and in the United States,” Kauppi explains. “In addition to these countries, I have received a good amount of positive feedback in Australia, New Zealand and South America. I am also negotiating new collaborations with some retailers,” he continues. Already during Kauppi’s London years, his urban streetwear outfits were praised by his professor Louise Wilson, who has taught some of the biggest international fashion gurus such as Stella McCartney. When talking about his future, Kauppi is careful also because of the rumours in Finnish media related to his possible co-operation with American rapper and designer  . Kauppi expresses his interest in new collaboration opportunities and confirms West’s recent visit to his studio, but prefers to keep quiet about the rest. He is willing to reveal something about his future, however. “I am thinking of changing my brand’s strategy a little. I will be focusing more on individual product groups instead of complete collections. I will start manufacturing simpler and more affordable products as well as unique products made by hand or even made to order,” he explains. With or without Kanye West, the international fashion world will definitely hear more about this promising Finnish designer in the future."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/3820/,High tech Russian fishing company is hooked on Finland,"Russian technology company Fishmagnet’s unique electronic fish bait is attracting interest across Europe. To tackle the growing demand the company has opened its first European sales office in Finland.  was established in 2006 to develop electronic fishing products and has since grown into a 30 person strong company. Now the time is right for the company to boost its internationalisation through opening its first office outside Russia: a European sales office in Lahti, Southern Finland. Fishmagnet’s growth plans are based in its patented electronic fish bait, ‘Fishmagnet-2’, which the company claims is unique. “All known ways of attracting fish affect only one of a fish’s natural senses at a time,” explains  , CEO of Fishmagnet. “But Fishmagnet-2 allures fish by influencing three senses simultaneously: sight, hearing and sensitivity to vibration.” Fishmagnet’s patented electronic fish bait is raising interest in international markets. The company aims to boost sales through its new European sales office based in Lahti, Finland. The Finland office, which was opened in December, will act as the main channel for the company’s sales in Europe. Currently the electronic bait is on sale in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus with a growing number of retail and wholesale buyers in the EU, including Germany, Spain and France. Initially Fishmagnet’s Finland office has employed one sales manager but the company has plans for expansion. “At the second stage, we plan to also have production of our electronic bait in Finland which means we will also recruit more people,” says Nikolaev. How the Fishmagnet-2 works is by generating three types of stimulant: sound, vibration and light. Sound comes from the bait in low-frequency waves which can carry up to 900 meters in fresh water and 1,100 metres in salty water. Vibration alerts a fish’s lateral line, a system of sense organs which detect movement and thirdly the bait has a light emitting diode which blinks periodically. This is effective for night fishing or rapids where noise and vibration can be cancelled out. The rechargeable electronic bait, which comes in six different feature variations, is especially beneficial in luring fish from long distances. Fishmagnet claims it can attract fish from remote parts of reservoirs to the bait. “This combination of an unique electronic device and an effective fish bait has caused lots of interest. It’s targeted at everyone from amateur and sports fishers to commercial fishing.” Finland wasn’t the only option for Fishmagnet when the company was looking for a location for its  European sales office. The company was first interested in Finland due to its stable business environment and proximity to Russia and the rest of Europe, but it was the ‘Finlanding’ competition that sealed it. Fishmagnet-2 works by generating sound, vibration and light. This is effective for night fishing or rapids where noise and vibration can be cancelled out. Finlanding is a Russian-Finnish program targeted at Russian hi-tech companies interested in international business. The program supports Russian companies’ internationalisation and it runs a competition where finalists are given intensive consultation and networking opportunities in Finland. Fishmagnet was a Finlanding finalist in 2014. “It’s a very good competition for Russian firms who plan to operate in Finland and Europe. We were given great assistance on how to establish and organise our business in Finland,” Nikolaev explains. But the new sales office is just the start for Fishmagnet. The company plans to make a strong foothold in the European market in the next few years and it has received inquiries from the US and Canada, where there is large target market of fishing enthusiasts. Fishmagnet is also planning to expand its range into additional electronic fishing equipment. When asked about the company’s vision for the coming years, Nikolaev has a clear answer: to become the Rapala of electronic fish baits. Finnish fishing equipment company Rapala sells tens of millions of lures annually. So perhaps Finland is Fishmagnet’s best catch yet."

In  ’s  , friendly aliens have discovered the Voyager satellite. They begin to watch Earth television and emulate some of the exciting things they witness, like racing vehicles over outrageous terrain. This might sound fun enough, but Traplight Games wanted more: they gave players the ability to add their own creations to the game. “In the beginning   was just a technology demo, developed on the side,” says CEO  . “The idea was that there should be an easy, intuitive and fun way for players to use their creativity on mobile devices, and this idea led to the birth of the level editor technology used in  .” When the game is released players will be able to create tracks, challenges and tournaments and share them with each other. “Recent success stories in user-generated content games have really opened up the market,” Rakkola says. “Games like   and   have proven that harnessing user creativity can give birth to thriving, active and lucrative games and player communities.” However, Rakkola points out that the most popular games with user-generated content are on console or PC platforms. He believes that Traplight Games can become a market leader in user-generated content for mobile devices. The three founders of the company – Rakkola,   and   – originally started working together in 2007. In 2010, they established Traplight Games and helped develop games for other companies. They spent six months working on the What on Earth demo, which impressed venture capitalists enough that they invested 500 000 US dollars in the company late in 2014. “We’re at a very exciting phase in our development right now, as we are preparing for a closed beta launch in January. From the beta we’ll get some initial data about how the players are actually playing and perceiving our game, and how many are creating content versus just enjoying the stuff made by others”, Rakkola continues. After the closed beta period they hope to have a soft launch during the spring of 2015. Following that they plan to expand globally. “Traplight is dedicated to What on Earth as a game and a brand, and is going to develop it further in the future. The first implementation of this technology is a racing themed game, but there is no reason why it couldn’t be used, for example, for a shooter game or a puzzle game. The story behind What on Earth is also rich, versatile and intriguing, and it will be easy to create new worlds and stories inside the premise”, Rakkola concludes. Tampere based Traplight Games was established in 2010 and their first game What on Earth should come out in early 2015."

Today, farmers renting tractors in Canada, photographers searching for venues in the United States and pet owners looking for carers in Mexico are flocking to the open-source platform to buy and sell goods and services. “What WordPress did for publishing we want to do for creating marketplaces”, says Juho Makkonen, CEO and co-founder of Sharetribe. “We have the technology if you have the community,” says  , CEO and co-founder of the Helsinki-based startup, which lets people create their own peer-to-peer marketplace. And it seems there’s no end to the communities in sight from selling rodeo equipment to renting surfboards, from booking a nanny to ordering a cake, from hiring a DIY expert to finding a venue for a pop-up store. Since the site’s launch with first paying customers in 2013, paying customer numbers are in the three figures. The company hopes they’ll be in four figures by the end of this year with the sky the limit after that. “We thought finding these entrepreneurs would be our most difficult problem but once we put the website out there enabling people to create their own marketplace, they suddenly started contacting us,” says Makkonen. “They might not be the next Airbnb, the next billion dollar business, but they can still be an extremely good local business, supporting multiple people.” The company is riding the wave of the sharing economy, which is expected to grow dramatically. In the two months since Finland’s premier tech conference Slush in November, when Sharetribe made global payments possible, more than 2 000 people have created their own websites. Not all of them are expected to convert to paying customers at the end of the 30 day free trial but the trend is clear. Makkonen says what makes Sharetribe attractive is the speed and ease of setting it up, involving as little as 60 seconds to create a new marketplace. You can then customize it yourself and it is much cheaper than hiring a developer. Sharetribe is riding the wave of the sharing economy, which is expected to grow dramatically “What WordPress did for publishing we want to do for creating marketplaces,” he says. He adds that the company’s biggest challenge is that some customers are expecting the sort of services and support provided by giants like Airbnb or eBay while Sharetribe currently has just nine employees (including one in Canada and one in the US). Sharetribe charges a subscription for the overall service with fees depending on the number of users each client has on their site. Clients make money by taking a cut of any transaction. The company is planning to experiment with other business models, which may range from charging a membership fee to placing banner ads."

Faced with the same issues a decade earlier, the United States had developed an RAI information system for improving care work that became statutory in all of the country’s homes for the elderly. , who had worked in North America for several years in the 1990s, and  , who had come across the system when performing research work in the United States, set out to bring the system to Finland – and succeeded. In spring 1999, a two-year project was launched in Finland to develop a software solution based on the RAI information system. A software solution as fast and easy to use as possible was built around the components created in the United States, and piloted by assessing approximately 2 000 senior citizens. The positive feedback resulted in the creation of  , a software tool for the RAI information system. A company by the name of RAIsoft was founded in autumn 2000 to develop and sell the software. For the Finnish market, the company needed to apply for a licence from InterRAI, an international research organisation in charge of developing the RAI information system globally. Today, RAIsoft’s software application areas in Finland include home care for senior citizens, care facilities, homes for the elderly and inpatient wards of healthcare centres, as well as psychiatric care. The company’s clientele of more than 170 customers includes both private and public sector operators. At the heart of RAIsoft’s software is a carefully crafted battery of questions, which the care personnel are trained to fill in. The patient data entered into the software assists in creating the best possible care plan. The outcomes of the care work are also easy to monitor and compare. “During the observation period prior to assessing a customer, the care personnel observe the customer and talk with him or her, says RAIsoft’s current chief knowledge officer,  , who developed the pilot version of the RAIsoft software. RAIsoft offers software to support decision-making and management in the social and health-care sector “We have received very good feedback on also taking into account the customer’s loved ones and asking them questions as well,” Boholm continues."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/viima-makes-feedback-easy/,Viima makes feedback easy,"The Finnish software startup Viima has made its first advances into international markets, promising to provide businesses with a transparent and collaborative feedback system. The company advertises open communications within their clients’ firms, as well as an increase in employee satisfaction. All this is done through what they are calling ‘transparent feedback’. “What differentiates us from other feedback systems is our ease of use, visual appeal, and overall fun. Regarding feedback processes, our specialty is making feedback transparent to all,” says  , co-founder of  . When Viima labels their feedback as ‘transparent’, they really mean it. Shifting from the traditional notion of standardized satisfaction forms and phone calls, their software seeks to bring feedback closer to the modern social media format. As customers submit their opinions, they are visible not only to other customers, but to shareholders and employees, and even competitors. In their website, Viima points out examples of companies that successfully reach out to customers in platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, placing them in the spotlight, and potentially creating more clients. This also encourages fair and helpful interaction with clients, as bad business practices would also be seen by the public. Nieminen, with other co-founders   and  , met on the first day of their Software Business and Engineering studies at the Aalto University School of Science. After studying subjects such as co-creation and customer engagement, they decided to apply their vision into an area which they view, lacks clarity and participation. The idea of transparency is not only topical, with an increasing distrust of corporations in the world, but can become something enjoyable for all parties involved. “What differentiates us from other feedback systems is our ease of use, visual appeal, and overall fun”, says Jesse Nieminen, co-founder of Viima. Now, Viima has set its eyes in the international scene after some time in the home market. “Until September we worked solely in Finland. We were in the process of developing new products by sitting face to face with our customers, which was easiest to do in the domestic market,”  Nieminen states. “However, we have been aiming at the international market since the beginning. Through our online sales sector launched in September, we have been in contact with international customers who are currently in the trial phase. “We are slowly reaching out to the international stage, especially through the Internet.” Viima promises companies access to feedback that is truly valuable for many reasons. With their approach the company claims that firms will not receive duplicate feedbacks from users. Each response will be categorised, a transparent control over public feedback will be available, and an appealing user interface will gather honest opinions in the matter of seconds. This principle of transparency seems to be the norm in modern Finnish businesses. With the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom describing Finland as efficient and transparent, Finnish businesses may seek to bring these modern practices into use in various ways, and Viima may be the first of many to adapt it into feedback."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/flockler-makes-content-marketing-more-social/,Flockler makes content marketing more social,"Today’s digital world challenges companies trying to reach and engage their users across a wide variety of social media channels. This is where the Finnish startup Flockler steps in.   was founded in early 2011 when the use of social media was growing rapidly. A pilot product helped media companies like   to build social news channels and from it the Flockler platform was born in 2013. In short Flockler enables brands and publishers to create social magazines, applications and websites which combine editorial, curated and social content. A brand can engage its audience by allowing them to contribute content through any social media service they wish using a specific hashtag. Today Flockler employs a total of 10 people in its offices in Tampere, Finland and London and has a roster of international customers, including one of the world’s largest publishing houses: Penguin Random House. “We have been very customer oriented from the start. The best approach is to create and evolve with your customers and to be ready to throw away products which don’t work” says  , CEO and co-founder of Flockler. “It’s not always easy to do when you have spent months building something, but it has helped us to build a product that really adds value to our customers.” The result is Flockler has matured into a feature packed, flexible platform that can be integrated to a company’s existing website or it can be used to build a completely new channel that works on any device from mobile phones to desktops. “We want to help our customers to make marketing more social, more engaging and easily measurable,” says Toni Hopponen CEO and co-founder of Flockler. Flockler provides everything from custom design to email marketing and native mobile applications, all of which is built on top of analytics to give customers real time feedback on how well their services are performing. “We want to help our customers to make marketing more social, more engaging and easily measurable”, explains Hopponen. “What separates us from publishing systems or social media curation tools is that we enable companies to build their own tailored social channel where they can produce and publish content under their own rules. With curation tools it’s not possible to combine your own content and social media content.” In practice most companies build upon templates offered by Flockler. These can be setup in a few days and don’t require any special technical expertise. For more complex needs, bespoke solutions can be built in cooperation with Flockler or third parties using the company’s API. Flockler is also interested in expanding the reach of web content. The platform currently enables content to be viewed on large advertising displays and TV broadcasts. A major Flockler customer here is Finnish Broadcasting Company  . It has been working with Flockler from day one and uses the platform to add social media content and monitoring to TV broadcasts. For example when broadcasting an ice hockey game, Yle can display real time or curated social media content on the same screen. For Flockler this is only the start of how its platform could be used outside more traditional mobile and browser based solutions. “We had one really interesting case in Finland last summer where [TV station] Nelonen and coffee company Paulig collaborated on TV advertising”, says Hopponen. “When Paulig’s ad was broadcast it used a live feed of Instagram photos from users applying a specific hashtag which changed every time the ad was shown. Our platform made that possible. It’s an interesting case of how web content can be used in a new context.” Currently Flockler has roughly 70 long term clients and a number of customers who use the platform on a short term basis. Most are based in Finland and the UK, but expansion has begun with new recruitment in Tampere and London and new clients elsewhere in Europe and as far away as Australia. “We didn’t have to make the decision to target international markets, that has always been built into the service,” says Hopponen. “We are focusing on the European market for now but later we hope to expand to the other side of the Atlantic as well.” Flockler’s long term goal is to ease the work of marketers and journalists. “The key to this is enabling a kind of ‘360-degree publishing’ where the same content can be shown everywhere from big screens and ad breaks to a company’s own website,” Hopponen concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/plaeka-dresses-men-with-nordic-style/,Plækä dresses men with Nordic style,"The two Finnish men who, in 2011, named their company Plækä, had no idea what they had just created. Now, three years later, this small nightmare of a name has grown into a retail concept that sells Scandinavian men’s clothing all over the world. The Finnish men’s clothing brand   was born when two men studying to be teachers grew tired of bemoaning the fact that their favourite labels were not available in Finland. The pair used to order their clothes online, mainly from Denmark.  and   set out to look into their possibilities of becoming resellers of Nordic clothing labels. They soon contacted various brands and bought their plane tickets to Denmark. “At first, the brand representatives were quite reserved. They are very selective about the stores in which they sell their clothes. But as soon as we got to meet them face-to-face, we won the deal right away,” Kuokkanen recalls. In addition to retail operations, Plækä’s founders had always dreamed of creating their own collection. They launched their first one last summer. Plækä meets face to face with all brand representatives. The men still visit the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair twice a year to select new brands for their range. “Our style is best described by the words ‘functionality’ and ‘Nordic simplicity’. It is all about Nordic serenity where the quality of the materials and the wearability of the clothes play a big role,” explains Kuokkanen. “You can buy ten shirts in a discount clothing chain for the price of one of our shirts, but then again our customers know what they are paying for.” Plækä’s own production currently takes place in Finland, the United States and Estonia. They mainly use natural materials, such as wool, cotton and hemp rope. “The world’s best baseball caps come from the United States, so we wanted to make ours there. Our belts and fabrics are from Finland, but the sewing is done in Tallinn. Our products still have a high degree of domestic content,” Kuokkanen says. Soon after Plækä’s website was launched, enquiries in English began to pour in. More and more often, deliveries also were made outside Finland’s borders.  Kuokkanen and his friends understood that it would make sense to turn the business idea on its head. Currently, Plækä carries 13 Nordic brands. Both these and Plækä’s own collection are mainly targeted at men – something Plækä’s owners see as their sales asset. According to Kuokkanen, their clientele includes men anywhere between the ages of 16 and 80. “When our customers enter our pop-up stores, they often ask what we have for men and are delighted to hear our answer: well, actually everything,” Kuokkanen says. A new collection is already in the pipeline, and the Plækä team has been asked to join a few pop-up events abroad. The Plækä team is already so renown that the brands themselves are contacting them directly, and not the other way around. “We already have to say “no” to the lesser known brands because we don’t have the time to market them,” Kuokkanen says regretfully. Its Nordic roots will always be at the heart of Plækä and are also reflected in the name of the brand which features the Finnish letter ‘ä’ and the Danish letter ‘æ’. Today the founders can count on the same question being asked whenever they meet with new people: how on earth do you pronounce the name of your brand? “Masi and I have always liked sailing,” Kuokkanen says. “The Finnish word ‘pläkä’ means the moment at sea when the water is calm as a millpond. All you can do then is to dangle your feet overboard and enjoy the moment. That’s a fairly accurate description of where we are right now.” Plækä’s own collection has been created in collaboration with various Finnish brands. The leather ornament’s for Karhu’s shoes were made by Tiensivu and the pattern on the T-shirt’s chest pocket has been designed by the designer couple Saana ja Olli."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-workwear-services-company-growing-fast-in-india/,Finnish workwear services company growing fast in India,"Lindström, the Finnish workwear services company, is growing fast in India, thanks to its unique business model and rising levels of hygiene in the country. In India, the care and maintenance of workplace uniform has traditionally been the responsibility a local  , a laundry man, who would take the clothes to be washed at a local laundry. It meant that hygiene standards were variable. But today, Indian companies are made to pay more attention to hygiene and safety for workers in order to adhere to global standards. Offering workwear cleaning and maintenance rental services to Indian companies was a no-brainer for  . “We created a unique business model for India, which includes everything from renting the workwear for its maintenance and sustainable disposal of the garments,” says  , managing director, Lindström India. “Today, we are the only rental workwear service provider in the market.” The service is simple: clients pay a rental fee for workwear and the centres take care of their mending, washing and maintenance. Many Indian companies who need hygienic manufacturing environments prefer to outsource their workwear management. The days of the   may be numbered because today Indian companies need to pay close attention to their hygiene as well as their image. Near misses with cleanliness standards are no longer permissible. Many Indian companies who need hygienic manufacturing environments – such as those operating in food, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, automobiles and fast moving consumer goods sectors – now prefer to outsource their workwear management. “Overall, hygiene and safety regulations are actively under surveillance in India,” Chakrabarty explains. “The number of audits executed by various authorities is increasing, especially in the food and pharmaceutical segments.” Lindström has been in India for seven years now with service centres spread across several states and cities. “Our growth rate is approximately 40–50 per cent on an annual basis. For the next year we are looking to keep up with same speed and hopefully grow our business even more,” Chakrabarty says. Any Finnish companies wanting to replicate Lindström’s success will need both business knowledge and courage. “Before entering the market it is always good to have an understanding of the potential customer base, geography, culture and business ethics,” Chakrabarty reminds. For Lindström it is not about making quick wins. “We are lucky that we can operate on a long term basis as a family company,” Chakrabarty says. “Our long term strategy guides all our global operations from investments to operational decisions.”"

These are just some of the words diabetes patients typically use to describe the glucose meter produced by Finnish company Mendor. Gone are the days of carrying a bag of separate components to check blood sugar level.  was founded in 2006 by five individuals from different universities in Helsinki. After participating in a national business plan competition, the team started product development. One of the founders was a type 1 diabetic, adding an extra incentive to come up with a new type of discreet and portable meter. The result was the Mendor Discreet, an all-in-one design with meter, the lancing device and a cartridge of 25 test strips all part of one small box, about the size of an iphone. “It’s about 20 seconds from pocket to pocket,” says co-founder  . “And it’s not just the speed but the convenience and comfort when you need to test yourself on the move.” The software, which accompanies the device, is another important feature. The Mendor Balance puts all your glucose measurements in the cloud, allowing easy sharing of data with doctors. The Mendor Discreet meter was launched at the start of 2011. The company, which now employs 27 people and had sales of 4.3 million euros in 2013, has sold over 150,000 devices. Although the company is now on a successful trajectory, the ride was not always smooth. In October 2010, in particular, bankruptcy loomed. The founders recall a few sleepless nights before they managed to convince existing investors and new ones to keep them going. The result has been three financing rounds since then of 8.1 million euros in the summer of 2011, 4.7 million euros in January 2014 and a further 6.5 million euros last July. The company has just launched a 3G enabled meter, Mendor Smart, and expanded rapidly in European markets and China with the US market on the cards. “We imagined that once we had developed a prototype and got the first patent application, that we were almost done,” recalls Planman. “In fact, once you reach those goals, you have to move up a division and actually make the product. The challenge is that you have very limited resources at the beginning to make the device and build up the company.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/storm-of-interest-brewing-for-kumu-drums-overseas/,Storm of interest brewing for Kumu Drums overseas,"Kumu Drums is developing its custom-made drums for an international audience. Helanen’s customers are a veritable who’s who of Finnish drummers. Also among them are some big names whose drumming expertise is less known, such as iconic HIM frontman  . Many international players have some or all of their kits constructed by Kumu Drums. These include   (Average White Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, many more),   (Toto, many more),   (Branford Marsalis & Buckshot LeFonque, Average White Band, many more) and   (Big Brother and the Holding Co.). Perhaps the most intriguing use of silver birch is when the branches of Finland’s national tree are bunched together and used to vigorously beat oneself. A common practise inside Finnish saunas, this is said to improve blood circulation during the cleansing ritual. For drum maker  , however, birch represents something more familiar – and more rambunctious – for newcomers to Finnish culture. Helanen has spent 30 years moulding it into the cylindrical shells that make up  ’ customised drum kits. “The Finnish birch is widely known as one of the finest woods in drums,” Helanen explains, from his company’s workshop in Hämeenlinna. “I get the birch from Koskisen Oy, located in the village of Hirvensalmi. They make it for me, just as I wish. It is special plywood, two models, with two and three plies.” The thin wooden shell resonates strongly when played softly, thus Helanen’s wares allow drummers to minimise the amount of energy expended when laying down a beat. A drum’s low, sustaining sound also has extra meaning for Helanen, with Kumu taking its name from the Finnish word to describe such. Fittingly, ‘Kumu’ also refers to a certain sound of a thunderstorm. This cloud of creativity sees Helanen creating at least one complete kit every week, along with a handful of single drums, tailored to customers’ specific requests. “I have done many unique patterns and finishes,” Helanen says. “Some have even wanted their kit to look like it is really old and beaten, even rusty. People are always so happy when they get their drums. They admire the finish and later have told me that they have stepped up levels with their playing.” Given that the local market has all but been exhausted over three decades, the Kumu storm is slowly shifting abroad. Last year, Helanen showcased his work at the Chicago Drum Show and the Hollywood Drum Show for the first time, garnering a very positive response. “People really liked the look of our drums, and especially loved our unique, self-designed lugs [the metal parts on the drum shell onto which the tuning rods attach],” he recalls. “Many said that ‘these are the best drums of this show’.” Unsurprisingly, a return visit is on the agenda this year. “It is the homeland of the drum set, so the USA is a really important market.” Elsewhere, Helanen is further developing his customer base in Germany. Potential is also being explored in France and the Netherlands, and further afield in Asia. Although Kumu has been predominantly a one-man show for the past three decades, this shift in customer focus is seeing the company broadening its operations. Helanen’s two sons are assisting him this year with increasing the volume of international exports and also helping introduce some new models that may even utilise different woods. “We will get bigger, but with our feet on the ground,” Helanen affirms. “We will continue with our uncompromising style, adding some fresh ideas, but respecting the tradition of the acoustic drum.” All of Kumu’s drums are currently made from Finnish birch, widely known as one of the finest woods in drums. This year the family-owned company turns their focus to international markets."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wikipedia-for-programming-skills-uses-finland-as-a-gateway-to-europe/,’Wikipedia’ for programming skills uses Finland as a gateway to Europe,"Online programming lessons aren’t a novelty, but the Russian-Kazakhstan born Hexlet has brought a unique real-world element to it. Now the company is using Finland as a springboard to international markets.  is an open platform for teaching programming which offers short two hour lessons for all developers, from beginners to the highly skilled. All lessons are comprised of two parts: theory and practical assignments – and it is the latter where the company claims to offer something truly unique. While many services simulate real-world programming environments, in the Hexlet platform assignments are done in an actual real programming environment built to match those programmers use for work. This means that a lesson can include interaction with databases, complex frameworks and applications, multiple servers and other sophisticated tools. Despite this no downloads or installations are needed, as the Hexlet platform is cloud-based and runs through a web browser. “Coding is a big trend now and some courses make programming seem almost too easy. Then people have difficulties using what they have learnt in the real world. In our platform you learn in a real-world programming environment,” says Rakhim Davletkaliyev. “We haven’t found any other programming teaching tool with the same kind of functionalities,” says Hexlet CEO  , who founded the company with CTO  in early 2014. “Hexlet is a bit more difficult than the likes of Codecademy, where you have a nice interface and a guy pointing to the place where you have to type a certain word. But in the real world you don’t have anyone pointing the answers to you, you have to figure them out yourself. That’s why our lessons are more realistic.“ This approach has helped the platform, which was first published in Russian last June, attract 44,000 registered users and take the first steps towards internationalisation. In January Hexlet launched the browser version of its platform (now also available in English) and was officially established in Helsinki, Finland. Currently most of the available lessons are the handiwork of the Hexlet team, but the platform offers tools for anyone to publish their lessons which the company will vet. Each lesson is required to focus on a specific skill so a developer can use it to learn something new without going through a time-consuming course. “Unlike with long courses, you will not only learn a topic but also use it in practice within two hours,” Davletkaliyev says. The business model is simple. All theory lessons are available for free, but accessing the practical assignment sections requires paying a monthly subscription fee. In addition Hexlet is looking to expand the platform to meet the training needs of business customers. “Companies, especially when developers are switching projects all the time, could use our platform and content to teach developers the skills needed in their different projects. They could also use it to teach their clients and partners,” explains Davletkaliyev. “In the future Hexlet could be a kind of marketing and meeting place for companies and programmers. Companies showcase their expertise to potential clients by publishing lessons and programmers use the platform to demonstrate their skills to recruiters.” Furthermore these ‘think big’ services are already under way. Hexlet has started negotiations with several Finnish companies and hopes to begin discussions in other Nordic countries in the near future. While Hexlet is officially based in Helsinki, its four-member team is split between Russia and Kazakhstan. The company aims to employ a few people in Finland and gradually grow its operations. “We see Finland as a gateway to Europe,” says Davletkaliyev. “We’ll continue to target Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, where most of our users are at the moment, but Finland will be our headquarters as we start to expand first to the Nordics and then central Europe and Northern America.” The Hexlet teaching platform was first launched in Russian and required download and installation. An English language browser-based version was released in January and at the same time the company was established in Helsinki, Finland. But it wasn’t only location that attracted Hexlet to Finland. The main factor was the support and funding the company received from Helsinki Ventures, an accelerator and early stage investor. “I spent a month in Helsinki as part of a customer development programme organised by Helsinki Ventures,” explains Davletkaliyev. “The startup scene in Finland wasn’t what I expected. The surprising thing for me was the number of startups and organisations that help startups, including the government, and the amount of large companies that are really open to meeting startups and guiding them.” Hexlet says it has been a positive experience taking its first steps toward wider markets and helped the company hone a clear and ambitious goal for the future: “We would like to see Hexlet as the Wikipedia for programming skills,” Davletkaliyev concludes. “If a programmer needs to learn about a specific skill, the first thing that should pop into their mind is ‘I’ll check Hexlet’.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/new-worldwide-drinking-trend-comes-from-finnish-forests/,New worldwide drinking trend from Finnish forests,"Last year British media predicted birch sap, or birch water, to be the coconut water of 2015: a worldwide drinking trend. Finnish company Nordic Koivu was onto it before others; they’ve been exporting birch sap for over a decade. When   and   started planning on a family, they wanted to move to the countryside. They were on the hunt for a place close to nature for their future children to grow up in, but also a source of livelihood. ”Whilst looking for a house we listed all possible business ideas for making a living in the country,” tells Susanna. The best idea was found in their very own garden. The newly-found house in Tohmajärvi, Finland was surrounded by a beautiful birch forest. The Maaranens didn’t want to chop down the trees, and the thought of sap came to mind. Now  ’s certifiably organic, free-of-additives and without preservatives, non-pasteurised sap is being drunk around the world. 97 per cent of their production travels to Central Europe and Asia. Arto and Susanna moved to their birch-abundant house in 1996. At the time they owned a company called Aurinkolehto, but they were constantly gathering information about birch sap from experts in different fields all over the world. Nordic Koivu aims at growth both at home and internationally. The company targets those European countries that yet remain untouched, and in Asia China, Japan, and South Korea The first version of the automated collection and production lines was installed in 1999; the first commercial products were sold two years later. In 2002 Aurinkolehdo was awarded the president’s InnoFinland award, and they have also been nominated for The Outstanding Young Farmer award. Ten years ago the company gave up its other lines of work and focused only on birch sap production. Sap has gained interest among the more and more health-aware consumers. According to Susanna, birch sap has long been used to treat different health-related issues. ”There’s no scientific research on the health effects of birch sap, and we’re not even trying to claim it’s a medicine of any kind. It’s a healthy natural product,” Susanna emphasises. The Central European customers of Nordic Koivu recommend birch sap for body cleansing and weight control. In cosmetics birch sap has been said to help the renewal of skin cells. The first bottles of birch sap came from the trees near the Maaranen family home. When the production was moved to a new premise, the sap was extracted from birch trees in areas rented from the municipality of Tohmajärvi. The production moved to new premises in 2012, and now the collection is done by subcontractors. Forest owners in Tohmajärvi area collect the sap using Nordic Koivu’s technology, whilst the owners focus on production, product development, and marketing. 2015 is, again, a year of change for Nordic Koivu. In the minds of some consumers, a glass bottle of organic birch sap might have seemed luxurious. Soon the company will launch a product with supermarkets in mind. ”The price of the new product is suitable for supermarkets. This way we’ll reach a whole new level of volume,” Susanna says. Unlike the bottled product, the new line will be packaged aseptically into cans. This means they will be pasteurised, then citric acid and, in the case of berry products, fructose will be added. The new concept means new flavours, too. Birch sap will be accompanied by combinations of birch sap and wild blueberry and birch sap and wild lingonberry. Like birch sap, both berries come from Finland and are organic. The sap is collected from trees using an automatic system. A truck takes the sap to the factory, where the bottling and packaging processes are automated as well. The harvesting period lasts, at best, only some weeks. In order to extract sap, holes need to be drilled into the tree. According to Maaranen, this doesn’t damage the birch. Sap has gained interest among the more and more health-aware consumers. According to Susanna Maaranen, birch sap has long been used to treat different health-related issues. ”The hole will leave a mark, and sometimes a small decay. The growth of the tree isn’t affected.” It’s easy for the owners to supervise the productions, since everything is made in Finland and, as much as possible, locally. Only bottles and caps come from abroad. With the new concept Nordic Koivu aims at growth both at home and internationally. The company targets those European countries that yet remain untouched, and in Asia for example China, Japan, and South Korea. “I believe there’s room for significant growth in Asia. Australia and North America offer potential for our product too,” Susanna says. In the domestic market Nordic Koivu’s consumer products have been marginal until now. The growing selection of products is coming with the hopes of increasing the presence in Finland. Growth means more work. Although the marriage is over, the Maaranens still work together, Susanna in sales and marketing and Arto in production and administration. Currently they have six employees year-round, but in the harvesting period 12 employees are needed for bottling alone. The new production concept will also lead to an increase in the number of staff. Being Finnish plays an important role in Nordic Koivu’s international image. This is visible in the name of the company. ”We chose the word   (birch), because at least to our knowledge it doesn’t mean anything funny or strange in any language. It’s also easy to pronounce for a foreigner.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-construction-know-how-helps-to-build-india/,Finnish construction knowhow helps build India,"Two Finnish construction specialists Elematic and Betonimestarit have recently made headway in the Indian market by opening up offices, establishing manufacturing bases and signing up new clients.  India is growing exponentially and the country’s cities are bursting at the seams. Building sites are rising everywhere but the lack of modern construction technology and decent materials mean projects are often delayed and poorly executed. Finnish company  , which supplies pre-cast concrete technology, has landed in India at the right time. “India is a massive country where urbanisation and construction will continue to be strong in next 25 years. Over 750 million people will need new housing in urban areas alone,” the company’s chief executive   says. Element precast housing construction is a relatively new concept in India, which means less competition. “We wanted to be the first company in our business with a local presence because it will help us to serve the Indian market and gain a strong position,” Jungar says. Also early to market is the Finnish precast concrete product supplier  . “It was important for us to try something new. As an enterprise, we had to weigh out the risks and benefits to make sure our investment would pay off,” says Betonimestarit’s director  . Betonimestarit decided to enlist the help of a local partner and established a manufacturing facility near Mumbai. “Finding the right connection is crucial because it is hard to make it work without local help. Eventually it was intuition that led us to the right partner,” Saarelainen says. Starting manufacturing operations was a decision which both companies made in order to stay ahead of the competition and reduce operational costs. “Local manufacturing helped us to be able to stay competitive, reduce our customs duty and high transportation costs, and to be immune to currency fluctuations,” Jungar adds. Whilst Indian market offers huge opportunities, both companies agree there are many challenges. “Getting raw materials is sometimes difficult and infrastructure is weak,” says Saarelainen. Also, the lack of industry standards hampers development. “India lacks countrywide concrete element standards but instead they are applying global standards with varying success,” Saarelainen notes. Whilst India has plenty of affordable workers available, finding staff with the right skills can be hard. “We have responded by creating a training programme, especially designed for our Indian workers,” Saarelainen explains. But despite the challenges, both companies are expecting to reap concrete benefits from their investments in the near future. “India is a massive country where urbanisation and construction will continue to be strong in next 25 years. Over 750 million people will need new housing in urban areas alone,” says Elematic’s chief executive Mats Jungar."

Being an enthusiastic backpacker, Silvennoinen was initially only interested in Lapland as a holiday destination, but soon holidaying turned into work, which eventually led to the establishment of her own hostel. Silvennoinen has previous experience working in hostels in Scotland and in Finland. “I studied business management and graphical design, but I was not interested in these fields, as they involve sitting in front of a computer all day. I weighed my options, because I could not find a company in the accommodation sector in Finland where I would have liked to work. I had no intention to stay in Lapland, but here I am,” Silvennoinen says with a laugh. 7 Fells Hostel offers beds for around 40 people in collective accommodation, or guests can reserve a cottage equipped with a sauna. In traditional old Finnish style, collective shower facilities are located in a separate building. Alongside travelling and entrepreneurship in the accommodation sector, Silvennoinen’s values include eco-friendliness and recycling. The hostel’s furniture consists of items that are either recycled or donated by friends. The hostel is cleaned using environmentally friendly detergents, and all rooms have been painted with plastic-free paints with no emissions. Created by Tinja Silvennoinen, the hostel is the result of 10 years of daydreaming. At the moment, foreign hostel guests outnumber Finnish guests, but Finns are expected to find their way to the seven fells once spring arrives. Malaysian tourists, for example, have arrived in high numbers, as word of a village full of aurora borealis in the middle of the Lappish wilderness spreads fast. A documentary on Finland by a Malaysian  adventure traveller which provides a quick glimpse into the 7 Fells Hostel has something to do with that. “Foreign travellers are more interested in the aurora borealis, husky safaris and other activities than in cross-country skiing. For Finns, it is important to be able to go cross-country skiing, as well as downhill skiing on the Ylläs fell situated just a few kilometres away,” Silvennoinen explains. When is the best time to see the aurora borealis? “The aurora borealis season lasts from the end of August till April, before it gets too bright. I think the best time is in October–November, but the place was empty then!” says Silvennoinen. Silvennoinen also likes to photograph the celestial spectacle, and when she sets out to do it, she brings the hostel guests with her. For her, the most important thing is to offer an alternative accommodation option for backpackers, budget travellers and lone travellers. The hostel is accessible by public transport from the Kolari railway station and the Kittilä airport. “I have no driver’s licence and I’m doing just fine,” Silvennoinen says with a smile. Eco-friendliness and recycling are an integral part of the hostel concept. The furniture is recycled and renovated in-house and the rooms have been painted with plastic-free paints with no emissions."

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/ak-service-ltd-heads-west-from-helsinki/,AK-Service heads west from Helsinki,"AK-Service Ltd, Russia’s market leader of onboard service products, wants to make its products travel further. This year the company will open an office in Helsinki, which will serve as a stepping stone into the European market. Currently   is the biggest manufacturer and supplier of travel amenity kits and accessories in Russia and the CIS-countries. Its products are used by leading transportation companies in Russia and the CIS, including Aeroflot, Air Astana, and Russian Railways. “We thought we were prepared and ready to offer something new and interesting to European clients,” says Alexander Ferents, the CEO of AK-Service. The company is also looking to recruit a head of office and two to four sales and account managers for the Helsinki office. In other functions the plan is to rely on outsourcing. “We won’t need too many people due to Finland’s developed outsourcing sector. We are not going to become an overstaffed company; efficiency is our greatest priority,” Ferents points out. Last spring AK-Service was one of the finalists of the Finlanding competition. Finlanding is a business competition for Russian high-tech companies that are interested in entering the European market through Finland. “Helsinki has a great level of transportation access and proximity to Russia,” Ferents explains. AK-Service registered in Finland as Sky Life in January. According to Ferents, the reason for using two different names is that the European entity must create its own image and build its own reputation. Ferents estimates that the value of the investment this year is 200 000 euros in organisation and management costs. Potential customers are the same in every country: ferries, cruise lines, air carriers, and hotels. The goal is to establish the company in the European market, first in the Nordic countries and then further. The aim is simple: “Becoming a big market participant and obtaining a range of new European clients.” The headquarters of the company, as well as are production facilities and the design studio, are located in St. Petersburg. The majority of the products is produced directly by AK-Service, although the company has partners in China and Europe. About 50 of the 180 staff members in Russia work in management and administration, and the rest in production. No one from Russia will relocate to Finland. Interaction will be performed via communication tools and regular business trips. The company wants to recruit exclusively Finns to take care of its Helsinki office. “We expect the employees to demonstrate those very qualities the Nordic countries are known across the globe for: consistency, persistence, and attention to detail.” AK-Service isn’t going to hire for example designers as permanent staff members. Instead it hopes to collaborate with Finnish design studios. When products are consumed and used whilst travelling, designers need to bear in mind not only style, but also things like usability, convenience, and storage space. The fact that the majority of the business goes through tender procedures brings about an additional challenge. “Hence it’s necessary to comprehend what the client wants and offer the best possible product cost-efficiently. That’s easier said than done.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finnish-pitching-event-breaks-the-ice/,Finnish pitching event breaks the ice,"This year’s Polar Bear Pitch contest in Oulu drew a record number of international contestants. The significance of composer   to Finnish culture cannot be understated. Given that the 150th anniversary of his birth occurs this year, it thus seems fitting to officially open an important event with a performance of his music. However, when Oulu Symphony Orchestra violinist   steps into an ice hole that has been cut in the frozen surface of the Oulujoki River and commences a musical tribute to the composer clad solely in a bathing suit, you can rest assured that this is an event like no other. Welcome to the 2015  . Held on 25 February, one-by-one competitors followed this musical introduction into the same ice hole from where they pitched their business ideas. A crowd watched eagerly on the riverbank, joined by a global audience following the online stream. Icing on the cake: Oulu Symphony Orchestra violinist Jari Suomalainen officially opened the event, clad solely in a bathing suit in an ice hole. “It went really, really well,” states organiser  , who first came up with the concept in 2013 as a way to support the local business community. “The 20 companies had some really classy pitches.” One notable change from last year’s inaugural event was that 11 of the finalists came from abroad. Given that ice swimming is not an activity indigenous to many of the cultures represented, some innovative approaches were employed in the lead up to the event. “I bought a pack of ice from the supermarket every day and put it to the bath with cold water,” explains Israeli   from competition winners Relevancy Data. The company has developed face recognition technology that first emerged in the Israeli security sector, so that it can detect objects, logos, music and emotions in videos. “We can now use this technology in the online video advertising sphere where there is a great demand for this data of the analysed video content in order to better target ads.” The international presence this year also extended to the final two positions in the top three. However, such a chilly physical challenge was a less unfamiliar task for them, having not travelled very far to get to Finland. “Our company is managing employees’ wellness benefits,” explains Estonian  , CEO of second-placed company Sport ID. “It is an out-of-the-box solution for companies to start a wellness programme among their employees.” Aside from taking up the challenge of pitching succinctly, the chief goal of participating companies is to attract investment. Third place went to Tinitell, a Swedish company whose mobile phone for children is worn on the wrist, and also boasts GPS capabilities. “As an entrepreneur I spend a lot of time at the office,” founder  explains. “I welcomed the idea to go for a swim in northern Finland.” Aside from taking up the challenge of pitching succinctly, the chief goal of participating companies is to attract investment. Several venture capital companies and angel investors were present at the event, and many more were following online. The interest generated by the event is such that over 60 per cent of companies competing last year have attracted financing. Aside from increased success with developing tools for businesses that offer corporate fitness services, 2014’s winning team Laturi Corporation still utilise the team working skills they developed for the event. Weekly ice swimming together has become part of the company’s weekly routine, according to organiser Kemppaala. “I admire the quality of each of the start-ups to be brave enough to face challenges and grow strong,” she states, pointing to how ice pitching reflects the challenges of entrepreneurialship. “You have to step out of your comfort zone and put yourself into the game.” Over 60 per cent of companies competing last year have attracted financing."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/firstbeat-the-finnish-secret-behind-teams-like-manchester-city/,"Firstbeat, the Finnish secret behind teams like Manchester City","Firstbeat represents Finnish modesty at its best. The little known company provides technology used by millions around the world – including the English national football team. Samsung, Garmin, Suunto, Chicago Bulls, Manchester City… These are some of the brands   CEO   casually mentions while talking about his company. The brands are united by a common factor: they all use Firstbeat’s heartbeat analytics technology. “Our users include millions of consumers, thousands of companies and hundreds of elite sports teams,” Kettunen says. Firstbeat’s technology is based on heart rate variability measurement. The analytics provide data on different body functions as it is used to create a digital model of a user’s physiology. The model helps to turn heart rate data into personalised feedback on the user’s wellbeing and performance and helps them to better understand their bodies. Accurate physiological modelling also sets Firstbeat apart from other heart rate measurement methods. “There are many things in the body that affect heart rate variability. Our physiological modelling based technology enables to get accurate and rich information on what is really happening in the body. We can see the level of stress, recovery and oxygen consumption as well as how exercise affects performance,” explains Kettunen. “What makes our method unique is the creation of a digital model, a big picture, of all the body functions. We can offer nearly laboratory level data without the use of a laboratory.” Firstbeat’s roots are in the Research Institute for Olympic sports in Jyväskylä, central Finland. At the turn of the millennium the institute studied how methods used by athletes could also be applied to the assessment of stress and recovery levels in everyday life. Firstbeat was established in 2002 to transform this research into technology which anyone could use to improve their wellbeing. Twelve years later Firstbeat has grown into a 40 plus strong company whose clientele is primarily located outside Finland, mainly in Europe and the US. Firstbeat is starting to see the success of the technology it has been developing for over ten years. Millions of consumers, thousands of companies and hundreds of sports teams use its heart rate analytics methods around the world. Firstbeat licenses its technology to consumer device manufacturers who use it to provide their users with fitness related information like training effect and recovery time. For occupational health service providers Firstbeat has developed a full lifestyle assessment package complete with measurement devices and analytics software. This enables service providers to give their customers personalised feedback on how they are recovering from work, what are their stress levels and what actions they could take to improve their wellbeing. “Currently our biggest markets are in consumer technology and occupational health. A lot is happening in consumer tech at the moment but occupational health offers huge opportunities in the long run,” Kettunen says. But Firstbeat hasn’t forgotten its roots. Its analytics solution for professional athletes is particularly useful in team sports where it can provide a coach with the information they need to win the next competition or fixture. Notably how an athlete has recovered from previous training and what is their current performance level. Despite growing demand, Firstbeat isn’t standing still. The company is constantly developing its technology which is supported by its strong ties to the research community. Currently Firstbeat is used in over 80 research facilities worldwide. It also has new methods and partnerships in the works. They remain under wraps for now, but continue to drive forward the company’s mission to provide meaningful physiological information for everybody. “The ‘quantified self’ idea is constantly in the media but it’s still a fairly small group of people who actually do it. Combining heart rate measurements with more advanced devices and our technology will give people much richer, meaningful information on their wellbeing. This motivates more people to use these kinds of devices,” Kettunen says. “We want to offer wider groups of people the tools to better understand their bodies.” Firstbeat has prospered through assisting top level athletes, but it is this ongoing commitment to help everyone that keeps the company grounded. This sounds like Finnish modesty to us. Firstbeat’s heart rate analytics technology is used by three main markets: consumer device manufacturers, corporate wellness services and in professional sports."

Hundreds of Lego pieces lie in a pile on the table; a pyramid and a helicopter are among the constructs in various stages of assembly. The green leaves of  ’s Fresh Wall act as a backdrop, purifying the air that is fueling innovation. First impressions are bright, fresh and energetic. Welcome to the office of  . Times have certainly changed in the past couple of years for the Finnish healthtech community. Nowadays, we are greeted with news of significant investments and developments in the sector on a regular basis. Companies such as  ,   and   are becoming household names. However, in 2012 it was a different story, with mobile gaming the darling of the start-up community. “There was no hype about this scene,” recalls    , HealthSPA’s co-founder. “We noticed there was nobody who brought together the Finnish health and wellness startup scene in Finland. We decided that let’s put something together.” The ‘we’ that Salonius refers to includes fellow entrepreneurs  ,  and . Launched as a hobby, HealthSPA quickly swallowed up their spare time as they set about fostering an open environment that would strengthen the local ecosystem. “We created a platform to help people take their ideas or business forward,” Salonius explains. “We try to function as the voice for the startup scene and merge all the news and promote the startups.” In less than three years the cluster has exceeded expectations, helping over 200 startups find media exposure, investors and one another via a range of matchmaking events. The effect has been palpable. The growing tidal wave of interest in healthtech now reaches all the way to the Finnish Government. National turnover within the sector is currently three billion euros. Every Samsung smartwatch and heart rate monitor now utilises Firstbeat algorithms for monitoring information. “Something is happening here,” Gianelli observes. “We are not the only people talking about health and wellbeing in Finland anymore.” Fresh developments are rapidly emerging. Every Samsung smartwatch and heart rate monitor now utilises Firstbeat algorithms for monitoring information. Clothing+ has developed a sports bra with Victoria’s Secret containing a monitoring sensor. Synoste has been making significant advancements in creating a pain-free bone-lengthening device. The list keeps growing. One significant piece of recent news was the announcement of Vertical Startup Accelerator. Focused on boosting the fortunes of healthtech startups, the accelerator is partnered with Samsung. So, where was the Health Spa quartet in the midst of all this? Front and centre, of course. “Based on the learnings we got from HealthSPA we decided to go full in and create a business accelerator,” Salonius explains. “We have been doing this for the past two-and-a-half years so we understand quite well how the sector looks like and what the needs are for the start-ups and other players.” However, the quartet is keen to emphasise that this is a separate entity. They will continue their work with HealthSPA, developing the ecosystem towards a prosperous future. Having added three new members to the team, the next stage for HeathSPA involves shifting the focus away from the capital region, shining the spotlight on the rest of the country. An event in Tampere on 6 March is their maiden voyage, with Oulu, Turku and Kuopio to follow. “Although Finland is a small country, the diversity is extremely rich,” Gianelli enthuses. “Finland can be the world’s hub for health and wellbeing. We tell people to forget about Silicon Valley, forget about Tel Aviv, think about Finland.” Slush, one of the leading startup and technology events in the world, gathers healthtech startups together. Finland’s turnover within the heathtech sector is currently three billion euros."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/communal-support-for-mental-health-issues-grows-online/,Communal support for mental health issues grows online,"Online community Heimo brings people together online to assist one another with a variety of issues related to mental wellbeing. According to the United Nations World Health Organization, up to 30 per cent of the global population has suffered some kind of mental health issue during the past year. However, given the stigma attached to mental illness in many cultures, at least two-thirds of these individuals will remain untreated. Seeking to stem the flow is  . “Heimo is a mental wellbeing community where people can share their thoughts safely and anonymously online, and find their peer support,” explains CEO  . “People can also connect with healthcare professionals here. The name comes from ‘tribe’, which is what   means in English.” Heimo offers a support community for individuals with mental health issues. This element of congregation is integral to Heimo’s success, with the community consisting of various ‘tribes’ of people validating emotions by discussing shared experiences. Significantly, using real names is not a prerequisite of joining the community, removing a considerable hurdle impeding many who seek to express their inner turmoil. The idea for Heimo was born when two Finnish psychologists,  and  , realised that there is an extremely strong stigma attached to talking about mental wellbeing. In short, people are concerned about being perceived as ‘crazy’ if they mention their mental health issues. Kurikka and Hovi decided to create services for mental wellbeing without a threshold: 24/7 services without stigma or the need to go somewhere to seek assistance. The pair was intrigued and began to think of ways to facilitate an easier pathway for those seeking help. A phone service was their first solution, but their clientele was hesitant to pay for it. After moving to video services, they were then drawn to the relative anonymity afforded by the Internet, but wondered how could they harness it to achieve their goal. Enter Alastalo, the brains behind one of the largest online discussion forums worldwide, Suomi24, who recognised that peer support within an easily accessible service was the key to their success. A tightly woven community would create rock solid foundations upon which the network could grow and thus help keep operating costs at a minimum. “The power of an established community can help your situation much faster than if you call a doctor and he doesn’t answer,” Alastalo explains, pointing out also that healthcare professionals can be also found on Heimo. A strong sense of shared support would also act as a natural repellent for Internet trolls. When such damaging disturbances emerge, the community would eject them before they can inflict any real damage. After securing initial funding from Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation last year, Heimo has been fine-tuning its operations in the interim. Currently participating in a closed beta version are around 20 healthcare organisations and groups who already have peer support groups in the live world. Heimo CEO Jarno Alastalo was the former leader of the largest online community in Finland, Suomi24. Interestingly, gamification is being explored as a way to strengthen the tight-knit community, as a means to further encourage user loyalty and involvement. “We are building a system where people are rewarded based on if they have been commenting, writing or listening,” Alastalo explains. “We are talking about having ‘aura’ or ‘karma’.” Monetising the service is the next step before the service goes live this summer. Alongside company sponsorships, a variety of chargeable extra services will be on offer, such as appointments with psychologists via the video service Meedoc. Alastalo is keen to introduce what he calls the “Spotify model” of subscription services for users to access such extra services. The open community will always be free. Once all the pieces are in place, plans are also afoot to expand Heimo beyond Finland, in the process diluting the global stigma attached to mental health. “We believe that community services are the best way to help most of the people in the world,” Alastalo says."

Gathering together the similarly minded Finnish start-ups and companies behind these in one convenient and supportive community is  . “The ‘serious’ adjective in this context refers to games or designed experiences that can be used for teaching, training, activating, raising awareness, simulating, inspiring change, communicating an idea/message and storytelling,” explains the cluster’s CEO  . “Serious gaming is a globally rising trend and in Finland we have especially great opportunities to grow big in this area.” “Serious gaming is a globally rising trend and in Finland we have especially great opportunities to grow big in this area,” says cluster’s CEO Matti Kuha Established in 2013, the idea of the cluster is simple: bring everyone together to share knowledge, network and create products that will eventually develop the local scene as a whole, benefiting all involved. “There’s no doubt serious gaming will break through big time in the coming years,” Kuha states. “We want to help everybody understand this already now and also to reflect the openness and sharing atmosphere of the Finnish game industry.” One significant step towards their goal last year was by signing a MoU with the University of Helsinki’s Playful Learning Center. Based in the university’s Department of Teacher Education, the centre researches and develops playful solutions for education. “Together we are creating a validation process for learning games,” Kuha outlines. “We start with pre-school and primary school aged children. They provide unbiased and honest feedback, so introducing new games in this setting allows for companies to get real time, critical feedback. It allows for analysis of the game in order to make improvements, with an eye on creating excellent content for the market. Later we aim to widen up to older age groups.” This academic stamp of approval acts as a significant lure for game developers to the cluster. “As someone with a background in university research myself I am very happy to see that the cluster is working closer with the Helsinki University and other research units,” explains  , founder of the  . Before joining the cluster Kanerva’s company had previously made a name for themselves with motion-sensor games from the   and   series. “We didn’t really consider ourselves as a serious games company before, just entertainment products. Then we heard about the Serious Gaming Cluster. We joined just a few months ago in order to see all the new exciting opportunities in the field.” In the lead up to Slush in November last year the cluster organised Game Cave, its first major event. Here 30 serious gaming companies gathered to demo their games and solutions. The impact on Virtual Air Guitar Company joined the cluster just a few months ago in order to see all the new exciting opportunities in the field. the scene was immediate.

Elsewhere, the Minecraftedu-based schooling concept from Teacher Gaming and 10monkeys.com’s math games have also made waves. One renowned ‘veteran’ of the cluster is Skill Pixels, whose Smart Kid-concept aimed at educating four-to-eight year olds has attracted considerable attention abroad. “With its wish to position itself as a superpower of education, Finland has really generated a vibrant start-up community around edtech/serious games,” states  ,  ’ CEO. “With dozens of companies now in the Serious Games Cluster, we hope that one of these will become a success story comparable to the recent casual games successes coming from Finland.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jalo-helsinki-kills-fire-with-style-and-tom-of-finland/,Jalo Helsinki kills fire with style and Tom of Finland,"Safe doesn’t need to mean boring, thought the folks of Jalo Helsinki in 2010. Now, five years later, smoke alarms designed by Finnish artists are for sale in different corners of the world. In April Jalo Helsinki will release a series of designer fire blankets, one of which features the much talked-about Tom of Finland.  was looking for a smoke alarm for his house, and he found himself wondering why none of them seemed to be decorative. Why couldn’t something that important and wide-spread be beautiful as well? The thought came back to him, when he was contemplating entrepreneurship together with three other Aalto University students. All of them had a strong urge to start a company, but choosing the field wasn’t easy. Smoke alarms provided them with the opportunity to commercialise a product that can save lives. Järvenpää says they started out with a cocksure attitude, instantly thinking about the international market. ”In the beginning we held a disillusioned belief in our own success,” he admits. This spring the product selection will expand, when Jalo Helsinki launches its line of designer fire blankets. One of the designs is of Tom of Finland. The majority of the expenses of founding the company, from starting the production and getting the product certified, were covered by the founders themselves. The investment didn’t bear fruit instantly; for the first three and a half years they couldn’t afford to pay themselves any salary whatsoever. ”Had we known how much time and money it all would take, we wouldn’t have jumped into it. Fortunately we didn’t know what was coming,” Järvenpää says now. The currently available smoke alarms, Kupu and Lento, are designed by   and  . The product has retailers all over the world, but the most sales happen in Germany and France. In Germany the product sells multiple times more than in Finland. Järvenpää points out that in Central Europe smoke alarms are a well-known product, which gives it a better starting point than in, for example, Russia. In April the product selection will expand, when   launches its line of designer fire blankets. One of the designs is of Tom of Finland, the same character that gained international attention when  . Järvenpää confesses that the reason for choosing Tom of Finland was his fame. A beautiful appearance isn’t an excuse to compromise the usability of the product. Jalo Helsinki’s smoke alarms can be installed with a simple sticker instead of having to screw it into the ceiling. It can also be both tested and silenced by simply touching its surface. ”Our main objective has been to make the product as easy as possible to use,” Järvenpää explains. Although the brand is strongly Nordic, the product can be customised with international retailers in mind. A Japanese designer has already designed a smoke alarm for Jalo Helsinki. New ideas are constantly being developed: ”We’ve been asked for CO detectors and a model that uses wall power instead of batteries,” tells Järvenpää. From the original four-man team, two are left to be in charge of Jalo Helsinki. In addition to the owners, there are eight full-time employees in, for example, sales and product development. The production itself is in the hands of a Chinese subcontractor. Järvenpää describes the situation as fluid. What expertise is on demand and at which moment varies, and a lot depends on international partners. ”New markets open up when retailers see us at international fairs and get interested. A lot is up to chance.” According to Järvenpää, the expansion of exportation is slowed down by the fact that requirements and necessary certificates vary by country. On the one hand, obtaining the certifications makes it harder to enter new markets and brings extra costs; on the other hand, it helps demonstrate that social responsibility and environmental issues are taken into account to an expected standard. Järvenpää thinks that being Finnish can be beneficial for the image of the product in many countries. ”In Japan, for example, the attitude towards Finland is very positive, and Finnish society is seen as an ideal example. In Russia, in turn, where smoke alarms aren’t common, Finland holds a strong value in terms of branding.” Jalo Helsinki’s smoke alarms can be installed with a simple sticker instead of having to screw it into the ceiling.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pulse-on-gets-hearts-racing-faster/,PulseOn gets hearts racing faster,"Finnish company, Pulse On, which makes highly accurate, wrist-based heart rate monitors is gearing up for its first full season.   was founded in November 2012 and spent about 18 months developing its own sensor technology. Last October, it began shipping pre-orders and this spring witnesses the start of a planned expansion from a pilot phase into the US and additional European markets. The company’s founders reckoned that existing chest strap heart rate monitors were not only uncomfortable and bulky but were only offering limited insights into an individual’s training. “80 per cent of traditional heart rate monitors are sold to men and 80 per cent of the heart rate monitors purchased are only used once or twice,” says  , head of sales and marketing. In contrast, the data shows that equal numbers of men and women are using PulseOn’s device and they’re keen to get continual feedback from their devices. “We are not trying to target everyone but we are really seeking to provide meaningful inputs to those who care about their fitness and want to see their progress,” says Asikainen. “The product is positioned at someone who is already active in sports, exercising two or three times a week and wants clear insight into their training sessions.” Weighing less than 30 grams and designed to be comfortable and easy to use, the wrist device measures heart rate accurately and reliably. The sensor detects the tiny modulations of light intensity caused by blood flow to best detect your heart rate in different conditions. After training, your PulseOn automatically syncs the details of the session with your iOS or Android mobile application, offering easily understandable feedback on both the training session and your fitness. PulseOn’s performance has been tested in various cardio-intensive sports and reads heart rate data with the same accuracy as the traditional chest strap based devices – all the way to heart rate variability during rest. PulseOn, which is based in Espoo with sales teams in the US and the UK, has high hopes for the future. “The sensor technology is the core of the company and allows us to build different products around the fitness and wellness base,” says Asikainen."

Co-founder and CEO   has a pragmatic approach to business and  ’s newest app is making waves on many fronts. Thür and Yousician’s COO   met while studying in Tampere University of Technology, Finland, and were teamed together on a student project. The end result was their first prize as a business team and the reward was 20 euros. The real reward, however, was the relationship that was formed and would continue on to bigger and better things. The students figured “we are either going to be the guys who talk about it or the guys who actually do something about it”, Thür explains. They decided to be the guys who did the latter. Both men had played instruments growing up but quit because of the way the lessons were delivered. In Thür’s words, “we wanted to do something we found meaningful and had the idea of gamifying the process of learning an instrument to make it more fun and accessible.” The audio technology on the first app, Wildchords, was not yet able to handle advanced guitar playing. The team built the first product around simple chord progressions with a focus on children as their market. The app was very well received but Thür and Kaipainen knew they wanted to cater to more advanced guitar players. Yousician’s Chris Thür (left) shows Robert Dunne how the Yousician app works in practice. Fast forward to today and the Yousician app boasts a sophisticated design and mature user interface, advanced audio technology and more focus placed on the journey that is learning an instrument. “We thought, ‘how would we build a product based on everything we have learned with our previous products, and turn it into the best product that we can imagine?’” Thür is confident in saying that “Yousician is our main product and is the product that we always wanted to build.” Yousician have won over 20 international awards on several different platforms and under many categories. It began with the 20 euro prize in the university and the team has continued to collect prizes under the Mobile Applications category, within the Education category and then an initiative by the European Union – the Best European Learning Game Award. “That was really cool because someone with a focus on education sat down, looked at our product and thought our product can really help children learn how to play the guitar.” Another award that Yousician has collected is the top award for Music Technologies at SXSW, which Thür and his team collected a large novelty check from. Thür wanted to share the big check with his team, so he insisted on taking it home with him on the flight back to Finland. It was too large and the flight attendant had to ask the captain whether it was allowed on board. The captain seemed to understand what it meant to Thür and he managed to find a place on the plane for the check. It hangs proudly on Yousician’s wall along with the city of Tampere’s Innovation award among many others. The company flew all of its employees including their partners and children to Greece last year for one month and plan to fly everyone to Thailand this year. This might sound like just a fancy holiday or a crazy idea but it plays into the overall culture that is cultivated within the company. Yousician app boasts a sophisticated design and mature user interface, advanced audio technology and more focus placed on the journey that is learning an instrument. “When someone comes to us with an idea, we try to think of ideas why we wouldn’t do it instead of reasons why we would do it.” From coffee breaks in the music room in order to learn the guitar riff of the day, along with colour-coding the notes on the guitar and encouraging people to paint their nails in the same colours to promote quicker learning, Yousician has its finger on the pulse of innovative ideas. When Thür and Kaipainen started Yousician, they did not know any other people that had started their own companies. It sounded like a “crazy thing” that other people did as a form of career. However, the beginning of their journey coincided with the startup grassroots movement growing in many parts in Finland. “You need a good number of dumb ideas in order to generate one great idea,” Thür says, “and we welcome all kinds of ideas.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/piggy-baggy-to-revolutionize-sharing-economy/,Piggy Baggy to revolutionise sharing economy,"The frequently used expression piggyback lends itself to a whole different meaning with Harri Paloheimo, the founder of the Piggy Baggy service and CEO of Coreorient. This rising business has hit the ground running in crowd sourcing delivery service. This business now employing seven employees, reaches out to businesses, consumers and local authorities in Finland. “Piggyback is a metaphor used when service is created based on another,” says Paloheimo. “The entire sharing economy is built on the internet. Piggybacking is also about carrying someone on the shoulders and piggy bank for saving some cash for a rainy day. That’s why we decided to name the crowd sourced delivery service  .” Piggy Baggy saves time, energy, and pieces together the steps of a crowd sourcing delivery service. The service involves distribution of goods from one location to another through ridesharing: a fast, secure and economical way of transporting goods. The creation of the idea was born from an experience that Paloheimo had himself. The family microwave, which was under guarantee, broke and he had to take two buses and a train in order to return the product and get it repaired. It was at this point that Paloheimo thought there must be an easier way to exchange goods while doing his part for the environment in the process. Piggy Baggy makes crowd sourcing simple and efficient for everyone. In addition to driving and public transport, cycling is a very popular way of commuting around the city and surrounding areas of Helsinki. There’s a strong trend, especially among young people, not want to own cars and therefore Paloheimo spotted the need for a crowd sourced delivery service. Not only would this save time but also money and would be more efficient to the planet. The easy step by step service is not only focusing on the single person but community based organizations and public institutions. Some elderly, youth or the unemployed are not able to enjoy or reach certain facilities due to logistic or traffic related factors but with Piggy Baggy, effectively bringing anything to your door, there is no need for anyone to worry that they are missing out on knowledge or educational development. For example library law in Finland allows everyone the right to books wherever they are located and people with reduced mobility are eligible to have the books delivered directly to their doorstep. As it is very costly to the public sector, it has been hard to obtain the service of sending books from the libraries to the homes. Now Piggy Baggy has designed a more cost friendly way of maintaining the service to society. This year the Piggy Baggy team focuses on partnerships to enable low cost home deliveries of online food groceries and other online purchases. Coreorient is part of the sharing economy which means shared creation, production, distribution, trade and consumption of goods and services by different people and organisations. As part of the European Union growth strategy for the coming decade, Horizon 2020 SMA, Piggy Baggy can scale European market quickly, legally and economically branch out to other business opportunities enabling even more people to enjoy the their service. As one of the 155 SMEs, Piggy Baggy received 50,000 euro in 2014 to finance feasibility studies for their projects. Looking into the future the peak of global oil production is decreasing and will further disrupt car-dependent societies allowing Piggy Baggy to branch out worldwide and distinguish a global market. Piggy Baggy is all about ridesharing, bringing not only products to your door but generating a society of efficiency, distribution, business and social connect. “Join the transport revolution that is Piggy Baggy,” says Paloheimo.

http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/startup-sauna-s-reputation-is-heating-up/,Startup Sauna’s reputation is heating up,"Startup Sauna, a community that was started by a group of entrepreneurial minded students from Aalto University, was established in 2010 and continues to draw startups from over 20 countries and interested investors to the 1500 square meter industry hall that CEO Jaakko Hynynen calls his office. Initially inspired by the entrepreneurial boom in the United States, the students started Aalto Entrepreneur Society. They had a lot of activities for their peers with an interest in startups which included keynotes from experienced serial entrepreneurs, investor interest from Finland, pitching evenings where students could get feedback on their product and even speed-dating style meetups that helped people find suitable co-founders to share ideas. The society was expanding as was  ’s events diary. “It was apparent quite quickly that they were holding a lot of events with a lot of people involved and they needed space,” Hynynen says. Good News from Finland’s intern Robert Dunne at the Startup Sauna space which includes a sauna that doubles as a meeting room. Renting out space was becoming a laborious task for the growing list of events and the students decided they needed a place to go. Following consultation with Aalto University, who were fully on board with the idea, the former hand sanitizer warehouse was cleared out, renovated and would become the meeting point for aspiring entrepreneurs in Northern Europe. There have been various iterations and interior design changes but the concept remains the same. It is a free co-working space for students, graduates or whoever else wants to walk in and avail of the resources. “The doors are open and you can come in and work on your school project or your startup. You are free to use the space as long as you clean up after yourself,” says Hynynen. Startup Sauna runs an accelerator program that helps startups when they begin to grow. Getting involved in Startup Sauna and introducing yourself to the people you find there is most useful when the problem and solution phase of your startup has been realized. Startup Sauna runs the program to put startups on a platform with some of the world’s major investors as spectators. “You tend to get some initial customers and then you plateau. This is the point when you are not growing as you might like and you can use the accelerator to speed up this growth and kick it on to the next point.” Startup Sauna has a pool of coaches from Finland who have huge wealth in experience, contacts and investment history, which helps in the acceleration process. The coaches are there to provide assistance and pitching help to the startups that are still in their infancy. One of the problems that many startups face is that they have built a product but have not yet built a business. The experience that the coaches bring to the table is priceless for a startup looking to expand and focus on their customer base and larger audience. “The accelerator program connects you initially to those customers who you are trying to target, the customers who see you as the best possible solution to their problem,” explains Hynynen. Startup Sauna is a non-profit organization and they do not take any equity from the startups involved in their accelerator programs. “This is a good deal for startups as they get assistance, connections and don’t have to give up equity in their business.” Hynynen has taken time out of his studies in order to act as CEO at Startup Sauna. It is a revolving door of personnel within the four walls of the system and this is down in part to the fact that the people involved want Startup Sauna to continue growing and never stagnate. The ecosystem of startups has a very clear sense of what it does and this is evident with the many returning coaches who have little to gain from contributing their services aside from the knowledge that they have helped a startup in whatever way they could. Many of the Startup Sauna coaches believe in the social responsibility to help out due to the fact that many of them have already put their businesses through Startup Sauna and benefited greatly from the experience. “Finland, as a whole, has a longstanding tradition of volunteers work,” Hynynen explains, “and the coaches have gained a lot from startup sauna and feel like it is time to pay it forward.” Startup Sauna has several areas that entrepreneurs can work in."

When one thinks of a bar in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, a budding business opportunity isn’t perhaps the first thing that comes to mind. However, when   led a tour group to North Korea last year, a local watering hole was exactly where his business took flight. After discovering that two members of his tour group were part of a team of brand marketing professionals, Viira suggested they meet up for a drink after the day’s activities had drawn to a close. There was something he wanted to discuss with them: an idea that he and  , his co-worker and lifelong friend, had been working on for some time. Needless to say they were more than impressed. Fast-forward a year later, and this fresh idea is about to be launched into the sector of the travel industry currently worth 350 billion US dollars globally.   is a new booking platform and pricing model for guided tours and adventure holidays, offering direct online sales. “If you look at all the modern super success stories of the travel industry like Airbnb, they connect the user more directly to the service,” Viira says. Along with transparent pricing throughout the booking process, Faralong also employs one innovative addition: “Our idea is brilliantly simple – the more people who join a tour, the less each person has to pay.” “Our idea is brilliantly simple – the more people who join a tour, the less each person has to pay,” says Faralong’s co-founder Kalle Viira. Faralong caters to a variety of needs, offering tours in around 30 different countries. For the traveller seeking a less crowded experience, there is also no minimum number of group size – the overall cost of the tour is the same, it’s just a matter of between how many tourists that sum will be divided. Faralong has already raised more than 500,000 US dollars from venture capital funds and leading travel partners in Asia and South America. The idea has also attracted a wealth of Finnish talent, including the former CEO of Finland’s biggest tour operator Aurinkomatkat,  . Also onboard are Rovio’s senior ecommerce manager  , and the founder of Proxy Ventures,  , who was behind the Supercell brand. While some of the initial investment has been utilised for building the platform, much of it remains untouched. The solid foundations of the service are already in place via Viira and Viitala’s global network of contacts accumulated during their two decades of travel industry experience. The remaining funds will ensure their business idea remains uncompromised during its opening chapter. Faralong has its sights set on markets in Scandinavia, the UK and Holland when it launches in May. Given the wide range of people embarking on such tours these days, an exact customer profile is difficult to ascertain. Yet one thing for sure is that the Faralong traveller will play an integral role in its growth. Customers will naturally seek out other travellers to join tours they have signed up for in the hope of driving down the individual price, acting as a valuable promotional tool for the company. Meanwhile, a comprehensive feedback system ensures quality of service. Travelling to the four corners of the world over the last two decades, staying at all manner of hotels and embarking on a variety of tour experiences has helped inform Viira and Viitala’s approach to giving the customer what they want. And, importantly, being acutely aware of what they don’t: “One of our values is not to mess with people’s holidays,” Viitala emphasises. For the traveller seeking a less crowded experience, there is also no minimum number of group size – the overall cost of the tour is the same, it’s just a matter of between how many tourists that sum will be divided."

In less than a week the game sold over half a million copies, and the CEO’s mailbox is now flooding with job applications. ’s team knew   would be popular when it was still in the making. ”Everyone has got a vision of what a city should be like. City-building games appeal to both mathematical and creative players, as you can build your city as optimally functioning or as visually attractive as possible,” the company’s CEO   explains. However, sales figures and feedback from both critics and gamers have been a pleasant surprise for the makers. The presales of   already took the first place on Steam’s sales list, and on its first day the game was played by over 60 000 users simultaneously. A quarter of a million sold copies within the first 24 hours is, according to Hallikainen, “an insane amount”. ”The game has broken all the previous records of our publisher Paradox Interactive,” she says. Although Hallikainen knew the game was good, critics’ reviews exceeded her expectations. ”Critics noticed things we probably had started taking for granted. The game indeed has got plenty of details and the player has a lot of liberties. We ourselves were really critical and only paid attention to what was missing. Maybe we’re just modest Finns,” she says laughingly. Colossal Order was founded in 2009, and   is the company’s third game. The two previous ones,   and  , gained popularity as well. Hallikainen points out that the newest game interests masses more than its predecessors; in Cities in Motion the player builds a public transportation system into an already existing city, whereas in Cities: Skylines the player creates the whole city from scratch. ”The game has broken all the previous records of our publisher Paradox Interactive,” CEO Mariina Hallikainen says. ”Not everyone is passionate about public transportation.   were marginal games due to their very idea”, Hallikainen says. The draw of city-building games was proven by   with its fourth version, which was immensely popular in the early 2000s. Hallikainen deems it fair and right that all similar games are inevitably compared to  . “By publishing  Maxis started the whole genre of citybuilders.

Hallikainen thinks that was because they were very open about the upcoming game throughout the development process. Also, players who make videos about games online were given access to the game prior to its official publication. ”People who are famous in the gaming world put videos about the game online, so players knew what to expect in advance. Before buying the game they had already started planning what they would want to do with it.” Initially started by a group of five friends, Colossal Order is now looking to expand its 13-member team further. Currently available positions have been open since last autumn, but it’s been hard to find the right people – until now. ”After the popularity of   we’ve received loads of applications. I’m confident we’ll now find suitable candidates.” The size of the team will stay moderate. Hallikainen deems Colossal Order a bit like a family business, and the aim isn’t to employ people just for short projects. ”Even when we started the company, we owners ate noodles and employees were paid a decent salary,” Hallikainen mentions followed by a laugh. Although all the energy is now put into removing bugs and adding new features and updates to the newest game, Colossal Order looks further into the future, too. ”Hopefully at some point we’ll be developing two games at a time,” says Hallikainen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/finland-and-india-developing-diagnostics-together/,Finland and India – developing diagnostics together,"Finland and India have come together in a fruitful alliance to develop health technology. Each country has expertise that complements the other’s; combining them enables the creation of new solutions. A huge demand for health technology is building up among India’s vast population. Around 70 per cent of India’s 1.2 billion people live beyond the reach of healthcare services. There is an acute need to provide health services for the entire population. For a few years now, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation Tekes and the Academy of Finland have been opening doors for Finnish diagnostics companies and researchers in India. This year, a   was launched, coordinated by Turku University’s biotechnology unit in Finland. In India the centre’s operations are funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) working under the Ministry of Science and Technology. In Finland the funding is attained from public sources. “Establishing the research centre was primarily a manifestation of what we have been working on since 2006,” says professor  , the Finnish head of the centre. “The centre will allow us to build on our positive partnership.” “India is a significant, growing market area that is worth accessing,” says  , chief technology advisor at Tekes. “For Finland the markets signify an enormous opportunity in the long run. Our goal is to develop new products and services to meet Indian needs.” “Finland and India have areas of expertise that complement one another,” Pere continues. “The diagnostics markets are growing in India at a rate of 15–35 per cent each year, depending on the product group.” There is plenty of room in the markets for inexpensive rapid diagnostics solutions, among other things. For example, there is a need for rapid testing methods for identifying common infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid, dengue fever and sexually transmitted diseases. Lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are becoming more and more common and also require attention. Another key area is health during pregnancy and the health of newborns. The co-operation is beginning to bear fruit. According to Pere, partnerships have been formed between Finnish and Indian operators that will hopefully soon blossom into business operations. Tekes and DBT organised the Indo-Finnish Workshop on Health and Wellbeing event in Helsinki at the beginning of September. The event generated a renewed belief in the future. The co-operation is shifting from academic research towards a more business oriented approach. “The present economic situation may be affecting development but the outlook is already positive,” says a delighted Pere. “Co-operation will be intensified and more organisations are joining us as we speak.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/rising-to-the-top-with-3d-imaging/,Rising to the top with 3D imaging,"Planmeca is rising through the ranks with its expertise in 3D dental imaging. The company was the first to introduce to the global market, for example, a unique X-ray unit that combines three different types of 3D data. The unit is opening up entirely new possibilities for the industry. Planmeca has combined three different kinds of 3D data into one unit and software program: X-ray images, photos and, for example, plaster cast scans. “Two-dimensional imaging has been used in dentistry for a century, but a breakthrough in 3D imaging only took place less than a decade ago,” says  , vice president of Digital Imaging and Software Applications for  . “A lot more can be seen in a 3D image compared to the traditional 2D image, because it can be viewed on a computer screen and from every possible angle,” Puhlin-Nurminen says. “The outcome of our product development is that a 3D X-ray image revealing the patient’s bone can be combined with a 3D photo that shows the patient’s soft tissue.” The Finnish family company Planmeca is both a pioneer in its field and the world’s largest manufacturer of dental equipment. The company was among the first in the world to introduce a unit combining bone and soft tissue imaging to the markets. “The unit has brought new possibilities to the fields of dentistry, dental surgery and facial surgery,” Puhlin-Nurminen says. “The combination imaging allows very accurate diagnoses and enables the planning of necessary treatment as well as the monitoring of its progress and the patient’s recovery.” Its latest achievement, launched at the beginning of the year, is a model that combines three types of 3D data. With this unit, a scanned impression or plaster cast of the patient’s dentition can also be superimposed onto an integrated image of the patient’s bone and soft tissue. “The result is a virtual 3D patient, creating an entirely new foundation on which to start planning the treatment,” Puhlin-Nurminen says. “This new technology also reduces the amount of radiation the patient is exposed to.” Planmeca’s product development is ideal for customers, as old 2D equipment can be modernised into 3D units. The product range is so broad that customers can find exactly what they need – all under the same roof. “More than 98 per cent of our production is exported to 120 countries,” says Planmeca’s marketing director,  . “Last year we experienced 30 per cent growth, and this year our growth continues. We have had more than 100 quarters of consecutive growth.” Planmeca was founded in 1971, and its biggest markets are the US and Europe. Demand has grown considerably also in the Asian markets. In China’s growth markets, for example, the company is already the market leader in both 2D and 3D imaging."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-better-life-without-money/,A better life without money,"When it comes to ingenious living, traditional ways and high-tech gadgets can go hand in hand. Various exchange services are growing in popularity big time. The Kaupunkirenki greenery service, the Stadin Aikapankki time bank and cow owners Suvi and Petri Sikstus are just a few examples. Kaupunkirenki brings together people with gardens and those without. The greenery service proved to be a success in the very first summer: demand is huge. The idea of the Kaupunkirenki greenery service came about in March 2013. It’s an online exchange service where people with gardens give land to those without in exchange for carrying out garden work. “We bring people together, but the actual contacts, practicalities and getting to know each other are left to the users,” says  , one of the co-creators of the service. “Demand has been huge. During winter, we will make preparations for next year’s cultivation period by developing our website.” Sivonen sees many elements that are in tune with the times in the volunteer-based Kaupunkirenki service: Finns are ready to open up their gardens to people they don’t know, and they are showing an interest in communal living as well as an increasing appreciation for local food. As urbanisation increases, back-to-nature thinking is gaining ground. A community-based way of life increases encounters between people and fosters the sharing of traditions. “Kaupunkirenki supports all that,” Sivonen says. “It’s a global trend.”  has tried out Stadin Aikapankki, a time bank for exchanging services. The principle is that everyone’s time, labour and need for help hold equal value. The members can add offers and requests on the online marketplace. “I joined in the summer of 2011, because I felt that exchanging services without money was a nice and people-friendly thing to do,” Toivanen says. “Through the time bank, I can ask somebody to do something I can’t do myself, for example shorten a pair of trousers. In exchange, I offer guidance in inner observation, which is a form of meditation.” Stadin Aikapankki operates according to the principle of the internationally known Time Banking principle, as part of the Community Exchange Systems network which comprises various groups in over 30 countries. The groups are connected, which means that international exchanges are also possible. Suvi Sikstus bought her own cow to provide the milk her family needs. There is also enough milk for the milk producer taking care of Illusia.  and   did an unusual exchange: after moving to Mikkeli, they bought a cow in a local milk producer’s cowshed. The cow, Illusia, produces daily around 26 kilos of raw milk. The Sikstus family gets part of the milk for their own use and leaves the rest for the producer as compensation for keeping the cow. “We are interested in what we eat and we value both local and organic food,” Suvi says. “We believe that well-kept animals also produce better food.” The Sikstus family easily consumes six litres of milk a day for drinking and cooking. “Compared to the milk sold in stores, raw milk is a gourmet product. Everything you make with it tastes much better,” the couple says with conviction. “The system works perfectly and we have clear ground rules. We go pick up the milk, get to be around Illusia and respect the life at the farm. This is a way to combine our love of animals and our appreciation for local food.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/anssi-vanjoki-intelligence-is-coming-home/,Anssi Vanjoki: Intelligence is coming home,"Intelligence is a growing trend in housing. In future, people’s homes will remain sanctuaries, but will also be objects that can be controlled remotely. The inhabitants of a virtual home will be there – even when they’re not. This is how professor Anssi Vanjoki envisions the future. Anssi Vanjoki, a self-proclaimed technology freak, is excited about any number of things, one of them being intelligent living and construction. Intelligence rose to the top of the agenda for Vanjoki, who teaches at Lappeenranta University of Technology, when the construction company SRV invited him to join a group of experts in contemplating the future of homes with a view to the year 2033. “More intelligent construction will become applicable to the whole of Finland due to urbanisation and the concentration of suburbs,” Vanjoki says. “In the future we will need residential construction that is more concentrated but which also transforms flexibly to meet the needs of the human life cycle.” Intelligent construction takes into account both what is inside the home as well as the traffic connections and logistics that are found outside of it. Technology enables services to come ever closer to homes, but homes also have better and better connections to the outside world. Sensor technology will be everywhere. It won’t just recognise when someone is at home, but also what they are doing there. “Sensor technology will be everywhere,” Vanjoki says. “It won’t just recognise when someone is at home, but also what they are doing there.” Intelligent technology is already opening up an array of possibilities. In nursing homes, for example, intelligent floors trigger an alarm if an elderly person falls over. Similar safety-related technological solutions are utilised in other residential construction. One of the concepts that Vanjoki refers to is the intelligent wall. “Modular sound- and heat-insulated walls can be modified according to need,” Vanjoki says. “A wall isn’t just a place to hang a picture or the background for a bookcase. It can offer a virtual reading experience, where you can, for example, lie in bed reading a book off the wall. The wall, when turned on, enables you to read emails and watch a movie, change the wallpaper or hang a painting on it.” Technology enables diverse remote control of the home’s various operations. It’s all about safety, comfort and energy efficiency. “You could connect to your fridge from work and if the ingredients for the evening’s lasagne are missing, they could be ordered from your local shop and be delivered in time for dinner,” Vanjoki says. “Technology will ensure that homes are heated only when people are at home and that appliances are turned on when electricity is cheapest.” “Finland’s strong technological expertise can offer numerous export opportunities for intelligent construction and living, for example to Russia,” Vanjoki says. “Another of our assets is traditional wood construction that takes modern technology into account.”"

Energy will be derived from the sun, algal cultures will provide additional bio-energy and any surplus will be sold to neighbours. As wild as these visions may sound, ecological living is already here. The Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation   hired three university students from various fields for the summer of 2013 to conduct research into how the everyday life of a fictional family, the  , will look in 2040. At the very least, the vision gives us an indication of the direction our everyday living will take. “We used the results of our research work to describe an ordinary week in the life of the Suominen family,” says    , a technology student from Aalto University, who was responsible for the section dealing with ecological aspects. “These are fictional stories, but they all contain a signal of truth when mirrored against current times.” “Along with rapidly developing technological solutions, living in the city is becoming more and more communal, as the culture of sharing is perceived to be ecological,” Ahonen continues. “Not everyone will need to buy their own snail pan or car, because ownership can be shared by several parties.” The mother of the fictional Suominen family is a real “energy queen”, who makes efficient use of the energy generated by a solar cell sunshade, among other things. There is a lot of talk about zero-energy houses in Finland nowadays. Ahonen poses the question: What if there were plus energy houses in the future? “Energy production will be more distributed – whether the most efficient regional solution consists of, for example, solar or wave energy. Residents can become small-scale energy entrepreneurs, feeding their surplus energy into the power grid and selling it to their neighbours. Alongside technology, Ahonen believes it is important to take the consumer into account and develop solutions that people are really willing to adopt.  “The energy rating of buildings doesn’t have to be determined by way of legislation, but by the demands of users,” Ahonen says. “People want to show their status and intelligence by being ecological. This could be linked, say, to social media services where people compete with each other on who has achieved the most eco-savings.” Ecological living is not just a vision. In Helsinki, for example, new eco-efficient urban villages are being built on the basis of ecologically sustainable solutions. “Eco-friendliness is the sum of many factors, such as building materials, energy forms and traffic connections,” says  , director from Tekes. “In my view, living in a way that is more ecological than how we live now is the only realistic direction to take.” “We are looking into how consumers can be offered even smarter mobility services, new energy solutions or more energy-efficient building automation systems in the future,” Kangas continues. “Finland also boasts strong expertise in these areas.”"

Safety solutions directed at senior citizens are experiencing growing demand as the population ages. The sector, which remains unswayed by economic cycles, has a bright future ahead of it. Finnish smart floors are in demand around the world. For example Elsi Technologies creates smart floor products. , an Oulu-based company offering safety and productivity solutions for the healthcare sector, was established in 2009 by the company’s CEO due to personal reasons. “I came up with the idea in 2008 when I became concerned about how my aging father, an independent farmer, was doing,” says  . “Having a technical background, I started to think about how we could improve elderly people’s safety.” Herrala drew up a business plan, found himself some business partners and early-stage financiers and was already out presenting the system at a trade fair in Stockholm in September 2010. 9Solutions’ system is based on the positioning platform developed by the company, which uses Bluetooth and cloud technologies and which helps to track both people and devices, indoors and out. The solution rolls real-time situational awareness, personal safety solutions and the optimisation of work flow all into one. “Our comprehensive system offers new opportunities for countries like Finland and Germany, where healthcare costs need to be cut in the near future by up to 20 per cent in order to maintain the present level of service,” says Herrala. Some 70 per cent of the company’s turnover consists of exports. In addition to Finland, its key market areas are Sweden, Germany, the UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia. This year’s growth figures equal some 500—700 per cent. The company’s goal, according to Herrala, is to maintain the same momentum next year also. Elsi Technologies’ smart floor solution has been installed in around 2 000 flats in Finland and overseas. The majority of the locations are care facilities but the floor can also be installed in private homes. As the population ages, exports are growing strongly in the Nordic countries. “The smart floor uses sensor technology to identify the location and movements of people along the floor,” explains sales and customer care specialist  . “The user interface has been developed in co-operation with customers, which means that it is as user-friendly as possible.” The smart floor sends data concerning the movements of residents directly to the nurse’s mobile. “The strong points of the system are automatic alarms and customisation, such as the possibility to adjust the sensitivity of the man-down alarm,” Hovi says. “The system also provides precise information concerning changes in the daily routines of the resident and assists in diagnosing illnesses.” “Elsi’s technology encompasses the entire flat and does not limit its interior design,” Hovi continues. “The smart floor is an invisible helper that doesn’t put a label on the user.”"

BiiSafe has devised a way to turn old smart phones into security devices that can be used, for example, in the home, at the cottage, or in a boat. The idea of giving new life to old mobile phones was born out of a need faced by  ’s CEO himself,  , in conjunction with the release of a new iPhone. Suutarinen recalls holding in his hand his old, yet still completely functional, smart phone with a slightly cracked screen. “I ended up getting a new one, but at the same time, I thought about the fate of my old phone and about the many features of mobile phones in general, such as charger detectors, cameras, microphones, motion sensors, and WiFi and 3G connections,” says Suutarinen, who has an extensive background in computer programming. And from there the idea took off, with the first prototype programs coded by Suutarinen himself. It quickly evolved into a diverse alarm and surveillance application. Today’s mobile technology offers countless opportunities to develop monitoring devices and services.   makes simultaneous use of old and new technology. To use  ’s app, users must first download it from the AppStore or Android Play to two devices, such as an old mobile phone and a new tablet. The user must then create an account, which requires only an email address and a user ID. The data is registered automatically in the cloud. The old phone can be used, for example, as the monitoring device, and the new one for viewing. The monitoring device automatically takes pictures at the desired intervals and analyses the surrounding sounds. If a security alarm or fire alarm sounds, the device recognises it and forwards a message to the viewing device. The program is suitable for many locations, from homes to businesses. The user can monitor the situation at any time, say, while out jogging or while on holiday. The app can also be set to monitor, for example, power outages and to take pictures or videos remotely. “In future, we might see a shift towards a decreased volume of unnecessary electronic devices, as their use can be transformed to fulfil new purposes,” Suutarinen envisions. “The iPad, for example, is already proof of how many uses one device can have,” Suutarinen points out. “Wireless capabilities, voice control and cloud services are constantly opening up new opportunities. The navigational abilities of mobile phones, for example, have already made separate car GPS devices somewhat obsolete.” There is major potential for  ’s app, as remote monitoring systems cover only some 10 per cent of homes in Europe, and in the U.S. the figure is somewhere around 20 per cent. Suutarinen reckons the unsettled global situation and urbanisation will keep demand for security services stable globally, at a growth rate of more than 5 per cent annually."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/entrepreneurship-spurs-new-growth/,Entrepreneurship spurs new growth,"Growth entrepreneurship has become a phenomenon in Finland, and its momentum has enabled an increasing number of startups to set their sights directly on global markets. New business accelerators are giving this trend an added boost. How did we get here? The ‘Slush’ event is a good example of the interest in Finland’s startup culture: Last year, Slush attracted more than 3 500 participants, 600 growth companies, and 300 international investors. “This year we expect the event to be an even bigger sensation,” says Elina Uutela of Aaltoes. “We expect Slush to further reinforce Helsinki’s role as a meeting place in the Russian and European startup fields, where no other event has been held on such a large scale.” “Work life does not offer today’s youth the same stability and security it used to,” says   of the   (Aaltoes). “Only in recent years has establishing a startup become an option for many.” “Finns are eager to remain at the forefront of technology and innovation,” Uutela continues. “The potential of agile startups is finally being recognised. Nokia’s downward spiral is not without significance, as it has led to the creation of hundreds of new companies and has changed how Finns perceive their place in the world.” Aaltoes is the largest and most active student-run entrepreneurship community in all of Europe. According to Uutela, Aaltoes’ focus is more on doing rather than planning, and the goal is to find, through experimentation, viable ways of helping startup entrepreneurs and those who hope to become entrepreneurs. “We bring people of all backgrounds together, and we discover what strengths can be found in the team’s skill set,” Uutela says. “Our spirit of entrepreneurship is characterised by a passion for learning, even if it means learning the hard way. And why would choosing a career that can help you, for example, solve issues that matter to you not be appealing?” Uutela says that startups have built-in scalability, which means it is “only natural that rather than focusing on the non-existent domestic market, we turn our focus to the whole world and keep our eyes peeled.” Tekes annually sets aside some 350 million euros to fund companies’ R & D and innovation projects. The goal of these projects is to come up with new, growing, profitable and globally competitive business. “The proactive approach of new companies reflects a society’s vitality and its ability to reinvent itself,” says   of Tekes. “It is better to create new ideas and business models than cling to the past. It’s not just about startups, but about the business world as a whole.” “Having a reputation as a creative country that produces startups secures the best employees, top experts, investors and partners for companies,” Häyrynen continues. “Young companies are pioneers of structural change, because change is seen as an opportunity.” Häyrynen lists Supercell, Primoceler, Zen Robotics, Tuxera, Dream Broker, DealDash, and Happy or Not among the success stories that have received funding from Tekes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/umbra-a-force-behind-many-games/,Umbra — a force behind many games,"Finnish game companies have been taking the world by storm. Behind the games, too, is top know-how and technology that cannot be seen, but which solves the “visibility problems” of the games. Umbra Software’s programs are used in many popular games. Founded in 2007,   specialises in so-called visibility optimisation technology and is practically the only company in the 3D game world to focus on this issue. It might sound complicated, but, in  ’s view, it’s really quite simple: “Our software prevents objects that are hidden behind other objects from being rendered in the game world,” Puha says. “Essentially it means that the games work better and more consistently, and that they can be enhanced and made more dynamic.” Although Puha makes it sound easy, it is actually one of the most challenging issues to be resolved in the real-time 3D game world. Visibility optimisation usually demands extensive work by graphic designers, but Umbra’s software does it automatically. “Our expertise is based on a very high-level of technical ability, i.e. programming, and on the ability to solve very complex mathematical problems,” Puha explains. Puha says part of this strong expertise stems from the demoscene of the ‘80s and ‘90s, which saw a subculture of computer hobbyists trying to outdo each other in computer programming using graphics and audio. “Coding was learnt the hard way, and people taught themselves how to program during the darkest hours of the night,” Puha says.  reached the markets a little too late during the era of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. So the goal was to launch   well in time for the next generation of consoles – and they succeeded. One of the best-known users of Umbra right now is the hit  . “Right now, on the cusp of the launch of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we are proud that  also uses our software,” Puha says. “Several more games that use   will be released in 2014, among them  .” And the American game studio Bungie uses Umbra technology in its   game series, which is considered the “  of games” in terms of its ambition. Umbra is also found behind the scenes of Quantum Break, created by the Finnish company Remedy. The Finnish game industry has been propelled by technological know-how, a solid base of hobbyists, and close-knit networks, not to mention  ’s systematic funding that has attracted foreign capital investors for more than 15 years. “The industry’s phenomenal growth has exceeded all expectations,” says  , programme manager of the   game programme. “We embarked on the development work because the game industry is primarily an export business that Finland needs.” Net sales in the game industry this year will grow by more than 200 per cent, and Korhonen says the future looks bright, too. If the total value of the industry right now is more than 2 billion euros, at that rate it could approach 8 billion euros by 2020. Promising new startups are emerging all the time. Korhonen cites a few examples: Fingersoft, Boomlagoon, Grand Cru and Seriously."

The key to this global conquest lies in a product family that saves the healthcare sector both time and money. “With DNA-based testing, the cause of infection can be identified quickly and reliably,” says  , CEO of  . “Our tests decrease the response time from 2–3 days to as little as one hour compared to traditional culture-based methods. In practice, the actual work only takes about five minutes, as the analyser takes care of the rest automatically.” Molecular diagnostics is experiencing strong growth and a major shift. “Molecular diagnostics is experiencing strong growth and a major shift,” Palenius continues. “New, exotic technologies are being developed constantly, and new technology companies are being started up at the same high pace.” “From a business perspective, the sector is largely controlled by major global companies, which has prompted us to select a few narrow niche areas for which we develop products,” Palenius says. A growth company based in Turku, Southwestern Finland, Abacus Diagnostica was awarded as the winner in the European Venture Contest’s (EVC) Life Science category last year in Germany. 130 finalists had been selected for the EVC competition finals from among a group of 850 growth companies. The Finnish company focuses on hospital infections and critical infections that require rapid testing, as well as tests performed on mothers and newborns at childbirth. The first tests were developed for the rapid diagnosis of a hospital-acquired infection, followed by a test for identifying the organism that causes antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The company’s latest launch is a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, which is a major cause of serious infections in newborn babies, in particular. “There are currently around 60 GenomEra systems in use globally, some of which are already in active use as part of routine procedures,” Palenius says. “Growth markets present a major opportunity.” Country-specific product registration outside Europe is a painstaking process, though. The registration procedures in Russia and Kazakhstan are already under way. “In Kazakhstan, the situation looks good: we might be able to start sales this year,” Palenius says. “In Russia, a lot of time and effort will still be required for registration, but we expect to be able to take matters forward there, too, by the end of next year.” The company keeps a close eye on the developments in China and India and the situation in South America, Canada and certain Middle-Eastern and Central Asian countries. The company also has co-operation partners in Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore, for example. If the second round of investor seeking currently under way is successful, the company will seek growth by rapidly expanding to several countries and focusing on broadening its test range. To date, venture capital financing has been provided by two Finnish investors. “By global comparisons, our financing base is thin. When meeting with potential investors, they have actually been astonished to hear how far we’ve come with so little money,” Palenius says with a smile."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/diagnostics-generates-growth/,Diagnostics generates growth,"Finland’s comprehensive, competitive and outstanding expertise in the field of diagnostics dates back decades. The future of the industry born in the global markets remains, for the most part, unaffected by economic turmoil. , a special expert for   (FIHTA), considers the strong point of Finnish expertise to be its versatility: its assets lie in research, product development and production alike. Finns, by nature, typically enter narrow, specialised niche sectors and excel at them. “Finns, by nature, typically enter narrow, specialised niche sectors and excel at them,” Ståhlberg says. “We have also had the courage to go out into the world.” According to him, it has been clear right from the start that the Finnish and European markets are too limited. Today, up to 99 per cent of production is exported. Last year, the value of exports equalled some 1.65 million euros and export growth rose to nearly 23 per cent. Diagnostics is a comprehensive term. It can be taken to mean, for example, in vitro, i.e. IVD diagnostics, which means analysing medical samples taken from humans. In layman’s terms it means laboratory research and the related equipment. “Diagnostics is not simply about identifying diseases but about monitoring the success of treatments,” says managing director of FIHTA,  . “From the point of view of healthcare cost pressures, the earlier the disease is detected, the better. Diagnostics can even be pre-emptive.” According to both Ståhlberg and Kajaste, Finnish expertise is competitive on a global scale and, in some areas, such as in the IVD sector and in X-ray devices, world class. The markets are spread out fairly evenly between the US, Europe and the rest of the world. “There isn’t a country in the world that doesn’t have at least one piece of Finnish diagnostic equipment,” says Ståhlberg. MedTech Nordic Investing & Partnering 2013 was organised in Helsinki on 3 September. The future looks promising because new growth-oriented companies looking to expand globally are continuously being established. The sector’s special feature lies in the steady demand for diagnostics regardless of economic cycles. New methods and applications provide new opportunities. “China is a good example; Finnish companies have already operated there for two decades even though business has been small-scale,” Ståhlberg says. “Due to the development of China’s basic healthcare, the markets are really beginning to open up. Long-term co-operation is an asset.” In order to support the growth of startup companies and internationalisation, a group of some 200 growth entrepreneurs, financiers and networkers came together in Finland at the start of September. MedTech Nordic Investing & Partnering represents Nordic co-operation and was organised for the first time in Helsinki. “There can never be too many events like this because networking and access to financing are vital conditions for successful businesses,” Kajaste reminds us."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/job-opportunities-abound-for-data-security-experts/,Job opportunities abound for data security experts,"Data security offers a myriad of opportunities. A company does not need to be a giant to be an industry leader. Good technology and solid experts in the field are always in demand. The Finnish companies Codenomicon and Silverskin are leading the way. , which specialises in software robustness and security testing solutions, has in 10 years grown into a global actor with 200 customers throughout the world. Even in a tougher competitive setting, the company has maintained an annual growth rate of 40–60 per cent. “We are what is called a born global company,” says founder of the company,  . “Today, around half of our employees work outside Finland’s borders. Product development takes place in Finland, and no operations have been outsourced. Everything is done in-house. We have all the expertise in our own hands, explains the founder of the company.” According to Takanen, success in global markets is not a matter of size. With a staff of 100, Codenomicon was for a long time one of the biggest actors in the industry, but then mergers and acquisitions started to lead to the creation of even larger actors. The technology business magazine   ranked Codenomicon one of the 100 most promising technology companies as early as in 2009. Meanwhile, the company has delivered on that promise, and has a bright outlook. Takanen says there is a lot to do, because security testing still is in its infancy. “Most software companies are still not performing any kind of testing,” Takanen says. “An increasing number of actors within critical infrastructure sectors have finally started to open their eyes and identify threats. We strive to continue our consistent growth while maintaining our position as a market leader.” “Cyber-attacks are an everyday occurrence these days,” Takanen continues. “If anyone wants to break into a system, they will probably succeed, because weak systems are being used in increasingly critical places. If a company’s product development process lacks security testing, the product itself can’t necessarily be trusted very much.” Codenomicon definitely does not lack people’s trust. The company’s participation at a cyber-security exercise co-ordinated by NATO around a year ago, where the participants were trained to defend themselves against attacks, bears testimony to that. The exercises drew on the company’s situation awareness solutions to collect, filter and visualise data from network traffic. Helsinki-based   Information Security has found its own niche in the field by helping customers to manage data security. The company has developed a model that can be used to define precisely the right level of data security for each company or organisation. The current situation is compared to the defined level and scored. This allows management to target correctly sized investments at the right areas and to monitor their implementation. The company primarily operates in Finland, but, according to managing director   orders have also been flowing in from the US, Russia, the Middle East, Cyprus and Asia. The company is growing at an annual rate of around 50 per cent and has a staff of more than 10. “The fact that we have achieved the highest level certified by both the European Union’s and the United States Department of Defence’s standards speaks volumes about the depth of our expertise,” Niemelä says. “This is a major acknowledgement. 20 per cent of our annual personnel expenses are used to develop and maintain our people’s knowledge and skills.” “New companies are continually entering the data security sector. Despite tightening competition we believe that top experts will have plenty of job opportunities in the future too.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mcafee-acquires-finnish-company-stonesoft/,McAfee acquires Finnish company Stonesoft,"In May, the world’s largest security technology company McAfee put in a bid to acquire fellow network security company Stonesoft. The deal was confirmed on Tuesday 25 June. Stonesoft’s founder Ilkka Hiidenheimo eagerly looks forward to the challenges created by the acquisition. “At the moment, 95 per cent of the owners have accepted the offer and McAfee has decided to go through with its offer,” Hiidenheimo says. McAfee, owned by the American IT giant Intel, offered Stonesoft a sum of close to 300 million euros. For Stonesoft, the deal offers the opportunity to benefit from McAfee’s global presence, which includes a sales organisation of more than 2 200 employees, best-in-class threat research and technology synergies. “The deal is an extremely important one for us as it enables the efficient global distribution and sale of Stonesoft’s technology,” Hiidenheimo says. “Especially the US markets offer considerable opportunities.” According to McAfee’s president,  , the acquisition of Stonesoft’s products and services is a significant investment in next-generation firewall technology. , senior vice president & general manager, Network Security at McAfee mentions three key reasons for the deal: Stonesoft’s personnel, the company’s technology and its know-how in advanced threat technologies. Finnish software expertise is the best in the world. “Finnish software expertise is the best in the world,” Hiidenheimo sums up. “The growing positive co-operation between companies in the sector and the increasing interest shown by governments offers considerable new opportunities. The McAfee deal also stands as proof of the level of expertise in the entire Finnish high-tech software industry.” Hiidenheimo established Stonesoft in 1990. The company went public on the Helsinki Stock Exchange during the dot-com bubble in April 1999 and its market value grew up to 880 million euros. However, by the downturn in 2008 its value had plummeted by close to 98 per cent. Hiidenheimo, formerly the company’s chief technology officer, took over the role of CEO in 2004. A couple of years ago, Stonesoft revealed its new threat category, i.e. advanced evasion techniques (AETs), which are able to pierce through almost any existing network security system, posing a serious threat to IT systems throughout the world. The company has, in recent years, invested heavily in its cyber security know-how. “Telecommunication networks offer the means to do either good or bad,” Hiidenheimo says. “The concept created through this deal can offer comprehensive solutions for safeguarding companies and communities against the advancing threats of the future.”"

Where else but in Festival Finland can you find world championships in wife carrying and air guitar? Prepare to receive nothing but good news. The world-famous   take place this weekend (5 and 6 July) in Sonkajärvi, some 400 kilometres north of Helsinki. Around 50 competing couples from all over the world have signed up to take part. Contestants will be arriving from the US, Australia, the Czech Republic, the UK, Estonia, Russia, Germany, South Korea, France and Ireland. How on earth did wife carrying become a global sport?  , one of the organisers of the competition seems amused: it’s all based on a legend. “In the late 19th century–early 20th century, a local Robin Hood who went by the name of  , lived in the forest near Sonkajärvi with his merry band of robbers. In the autumn, the mob would go pillage villages on the eastern border, taking everything they could carry with them back to the forest. Sometimes it was a sack of wheat, sometimes the maid, daughter or even mistress of the house. “Many wanted to join the band but there wasn’t room for everyone,” Tervonen says. “Whoever ran 250 metres the fastest with a sack of rye on his back won a place in the outlaw band. The 253.5 metres run today is based on this, because the effective range of the rifles of Ronkainen’s day was 250 metres. Whoever could run this distance as quickly as possible was safe.” This year marks the 18th Wife Carrying World Championships. According to Tervonen, the event’s popularity is guaranteed and international interest is massive. In addition to the legend, the event is guided by a strong mission: to once a year bring more joy to the endless sea of bad news out there. “Some of the competitors take the competition seriously, while others just want to put on a show,” Tervonen explains. “While the best clear the demanding course with its water obstacles in just one minute, others take their time, wanting to be in the spotlight. If you take it seriously, this is a tough sport that requires speed, endurance and good vital capacity. It is best suited to half-milers.” The prize for winning is mostly just fame and glory. The event is carried out with the help of volunteers and the organisers donate the proceeds from the competition to local sports associations, for example. They also dream big. If Tervonen were allowed to decide, he would make wife carrying an Olympic sport. The best air guitarists are charismatic performers. Last year’s winner was Justin “Nordic Thunder” Howard from the United States (in photo). The  , held in Oulu from 21 to 24 August, also celebrate their 18th year this summer. Oulu is some 200 kilometres north of Sonkajärvi. The World Championships were born in 1996 when the Oulu Music Video Festival was looking for an outdoor event. Producer   explains that the idea for the air guitar competition was born out of a random remark. “Now, we have come to realise that playing air guitar is about visualising the music,” Jakku says. “Simultaneously, the ideology of the competition includes promoting world peace and ending climate change.” Just like the Wife Carrying World Championships, the international visibility of the air guitar competition has skyrocketed due to international competitors and journalists. When   listed the event as one of the key events of 2001, its press coverage grew exponentially. Today, the World Championships are a registered trademark. Competitors arrive annually from 15 to 30 countries, depending on the number of challengers, i.e. dark horses, battling against the masters. The championships consist of an entire four-day festival with many supporting events. “Playing air guitar is a universal phenomenon, which is unrelated to nationality, but part of rock music and popular culture,” Jakku exlains. “Organising the competition in Finland might be our way of manifesting our sense of irony: although we are modest and shy, we have the audacity to organise peculiar events.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/tablets-in-the-classroom/,Tablets in the classroom,"Six upper secondary schools in Finland introduced iPads in the learning environment two years ago. The exercise is part of the Mobiluck project, which aims to bring learning and teaching into a new era. The project also serves as practice for the electronic matriculation examination which will be introduced in 2016. Tablets will become a more familiar sight in the academic environment in the coming years. Experiences gained in the Mobiluck project, for example with the use of iPads, have been encouraging.  is a learning environment project supported by the Finnish Ministry of Education that focusses on using iPads and other tablets in upper secondary school classrooms, in coaching students, in teamwork and in entrepreneurship education. The project is the brainchild of headmasters and teachers involved in   an entrepreneurship upper secondary school network project, who wanted to bring a technology perspective to daily school life. “The ideas and development work for the Mobiluck project came about online, via social media and cloud services, for example. Information concerning the project is still shared almost exclusively on Facebook, Twitter and blogs – quickly and conveniently,” says the co-ordinator of Mobiluck,   from Voionmaa Upper Secondary School. Ilomäki has worked at Voionmaa Upper Secondary School for 13 years. Within a few months of being introduced in classes, the iPads changed the attitudes of the school’s teachers to how technology can be used in teaching. All of the teachers received their own tablet, in addition to which the students were given the use of 45 devices. “In addition to theory and lectures, these days we also need hands-on learning,” Ilomäki says. “With mobile technology, learning can be made perceptual, which changes the teacher’s role from that of a lecturer to one who provides guidance. Technology gives rise to new forms of pedagogical experimentation.” Right now, tablets are most important in acquiring information. The best thing about them is that they are easy to use, even for those who have never used one before. Now is the time to test them out and practice using them, as the matriculation examination will be in electronic form as of 2016. “We are in a transition: the days of doing an exam on paper and learning by rote are coming to an end. It is also about practicing the skills needed in working life,” says Ilomäki. – The Mobiluck project supports the studies of upper secondary school students, as well as project and team learning using mobile technology. Mobile technology and social media can also be used to support the networking opportunities and international activities of upper secondary schools. – The following upper secondary schools are involved in the project: Elimäki (Kouvola), Kauhava, Klassikka (Kuopio), Muurame, the Otava internet school for adults, and Voionmaa (Jyväskylä). – The project will stretch into 2015 and among the new themes is  , which involves theory lessons recorded on video which the students watch in advance. With this teaching method, class time is reserved for experiments, discussions, hands-on activities and projects. At Elimäki Upper Secondary School in Kouvola iPads are used in teaching in a number of ways. “Every teacher who wants a tablet gets one. Some of the devices can be loaned for classes, so there is always a ‘mobile computer class’ available,” says headmaster  . The devices are put to good use, for example, in communications and mass media classes, in PE class and in connection with the school library. French teacher   has compiled French learning material in a new form using iPad’s Pearltrees program, and together with his students has compiled teaching material, such as recordings and text, using the Book Creator program. “iPads help teachers in their work in many ways. In PE class, for example, the teacher always has Internet access – both on the sports field and in the gym. For students, iPads offer new and hands-on forms of learning that come naturally to today’s youth.” Internet use has increased among teachers, according to Rajala, because with these devices, it is much easier to access information than before. “A major shift is yet to come, however,” Rajala says. “We will see the effects within a few years, when every upper secondary student has their own device: a tablet or a laptop.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/a-new-take-on-traffic-services/,A new take on traffic services,"Among the areas targeted for development in the near future are the interplay between vehicles and infrastructure, as well as electric cars and emission-free traffic. This is an era of mobility-related innovations. The goal of the innovative “multi-service model”, which serves the needs of traffic, mobility and logistics, is to reduce emissions, increase safety and traffic flow, and to generate new transport-related services and offer them in a readily available form. Taking part in this national co-operation programme are the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the  , the Finnish Transport Safety Agency, and Tekes. “The new services will make use of the same basic elements, such as user recognition, navigation, data transfer and payment processes,” explains development manager   from the Finnish Transport Agency. “Consumers can choose the device that they want and at the same time buy the services they need, just like when purchasing a mobile phone and simultaneously signing up with a telecommunications operator.” “Multi-services could, in practice, take over the functions of various separately operating devices and systems and therefore bring cost savings. From the service provider’s viewpoint, the objective of the model is to attain synergy benefits and create new business opportunities.” The services produced under the multi-service concept can be roughly divided into public services and commercial services. The public services could include, for example, various types of traffic safety bulletins and payments. Commercial services include applications related to fleet management, navigation, traffic reports, electronic payments and reservations. According to Kummala, technology is no longer the issue when developing services, because it makes many things possible and holds a lot of potential. “An interesting new feature is the opening up of the data in a vehicle’s internal systems for use by application developers. This will also lead to the creation of a wide range of services,” Kummala explains. A person using the display of a data terminal installed in a car or a tablet, smart phone or navigator linked to the data terminal can, in future, have access to a variety of services. In practical terms this could mean searching for a free parking space and paying for parking, receiving up-to-date traffic information and warnings, insurance services and electronic remote vehicle inspections or tourist and navigation services. A few projects stemming from last spring’s call for research proposals on the multi-service model have been launched to get things going. Companies have also taken the initiative by independently developing a variety of trial services. “As we are dealing with creating an ecosystem and an operating model rather than some kind of system, it will be constructed piece by piece,” Kummala says. The developed services are expected to be competitive on a global scale and marketable throughout Europe. “Our solid know-how in the areas of mobile and navigation technology give us an advantage in this area, too. Due to the fast pace of development and large volumes that are out there, we need to keep working constantly. Our possibilities are good, however, because success will require smooth co-operation between the various parties. And that is something that we have a flair for,” Kummala sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/on-the-road-to-sustainable-development/,On the road to sustainable development,"Future transport needs to be put on the road of sustainable development. What kind of journey lies ahead and where will it take us? Research professor Nils-Olof Nylund from VTT leads the way. By 2050, the transport sector will need to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 60 to 80 per cent. In order to achieve that goal, more emphasis must be placed on the energy efficiency of vehicles, low-carbon energy sources must be taken into use, the use of public transport must be increased and the efficiency and performance of the whole transport system must be improved by utilising information technology, among other things. That is a tough goal. “On a global scale, the increase in transport volumes threatens to offset the reductions in emissions resulting from technical progress,” Nylund says. “In Finland, however, carbon dioxide emissions from transport are expected to decline after 2015.” According to Nylund, technical progress has been swift. On the vehicle level, for example, electronic control systems, upgraded fuel injection systems and charging have improved energy efficiencly significantly. “The tightening EU regulations will entail better quality biofuels in future. Electrification is advancing, thanks to which most of the new passenger cars will probably be powered by electricity by 2050. Information systems will also enable more efficient use of vehicles and smoother travel and logistics chains.” The objective of smart mobility solutions is to shift the focus of transport politics from building and maintaining traffic networks to ensuring smooth traveling and transportation. “Smart mobility means improving the smoothness or safety of transport by means of information and communications technology. Smart solutions make it easier for citizens to move around, whether they choose to use their own car or public transport,” says Nylund. Future transport will require urban infrastructure to be adapted according to the development that is taking place. In practice, this will involve a variety of actions, such as land use planning, attractiveness and smoothness of public transport, providing facilities for charging electric cars in residential and public buildings and developing an infrastructure of alternative energy sources. What will the transport sector look like then in, say, 20 years? “That remains to be seen, but hopefully local air quality problems will be a thing of the past and the greenhouse gas emissions from transport will have taken a clear downward trend,” Nylund envisions. In 20 years, efficient biofuels and electricity will play a significant role in road transport. Smart systems will also have improved the availability of public transport systems and the efficiency of logistics chains. “We still have to keep in mind that the average age of a scrapped car in Finland is 20 years. Today’s brand new cars might still be in use in 20 years, although I wish they weren’t. In the 2030s, we will not see flying passenger cars yet…”"

This sea change will create major opportunities for Finnish ice-breaking expertise. As the climate becomes warmer, the three Arctic seaways – the Northeast Passage north of Russia, the Northwest Passage north of Canada and the so-called Polar Route – will cut shipping distances by as much as 20 to 40 per cent compared with the routes through the Panama and Suez canals. The Northeast Passage is spearheading this development with its nuclear-powered icebreaker service. “In 2012, approximately 1.4 million tonnes of cargo aboard 43 vessels passed along this route. Russia aims to have some 20 million tonnes of cargo go through by 2020. The reported capacity is up to 50 million tonnes,” says  , CEO of  . “Another reason for the more frequent use of the Arctic seaways is the growing utilisation of natural resources in these areas,” Vauraste points out. “The region has significant hydrocarbon and mineral reserves that will become more readily accessible as polar ice decreases.” According to Vauraste, Finland is the only country in the world with expertise in designing, building and operating icebreakers and other vessel types suitable for the Arctic. There will be no lack of opportunities due to the fact that the current global fleet of around 100 ageing icebreakers hardly meets even today’s needs. “At least 20–40 new icebreakers will be required within the next 10–20 years to replace old ones and to meet new needs, and this includes proficient crews for operating them as well,” says Vauraste. Building 10 new icebreakers creates a turnover potential of 1.5 billion euros and requires some 10 000 man-years of work. Once completed, operating 10 icebreakers over their life cycle will additionally create turnover potential of five-to-six billion euros and 15 000 man-years. When multiplied by three, this amounts to an expected business potential of up to 75 000 man-years and 20 billion euros, equalling roughly one-third of the annual budget of the Finnish state. “Can Finland afford to let this growth generator slip out of its hands?” asks Vauraste. Environmental issues pose a particular challenge for future development because increasing activity also increases risks. “Finland needs to export its globally superior know-how to make the increasing volume of traffic safe and sustainable,” Vauraste says. “Finnish expertise in combatting oil spills is also world class.” Additional factors affecting Finland’s position in terms of maritime logistics are the EU’s imminent sulphur emissions directive and EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) which will both cut back emissions and increase shipping costs. Arctia has used Wärtsilä technology for converting its multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to comply with the new environmental regulations. The conversion reduces the ships’ SOx emissions by more than 99 per cent, NOx emissions by approximately 90 per cent and particulate emissions by around 50 per cent."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/sporty-electric-car-on-its-way/,Sporty electric car on its way,"The Finnish company Scarlet Motors was born out of two men’s passion for cars. They are now developing a sporty electric car. Although it will take a while before it will be launched on the market, expectations are already red hot. The men behind Scarlet Motors are     and    . Both say that their love of cars goes back to when they were little boys. Kallio discovered electric cars after joining the “Electric Cars – Now” community, whose objective is to convert cars fitted with a combustion engine into electric cars. “Joona soon understood the potential that lies in electric cars. I had also been monitoring the development of the modern electric car pioneer Tesla and I was quite interested in its technology,” says the company’s CEO Fourgeaud, recalling the company’s early days. “Surprisingly little effort has been put into the design of electric cars,” Fourgeaud says. “As a designer, Joona looked at the cars from a new perspective and came to the conclusion that if someone designed a car sexy enough, people wouldn’t care whether it’s electric or not. He founded a company and asked me on board.” Developing a new car takes three years on average. According to Fourgeaud, Finland has the perfect conditions for developing a new car. “The country has a high number of companies operating in the automotive industry. The Finns are car aficionados and Finland is home to some top drivers. The perseverance inherent in Finnish culture has also made it easier for us to start developing our own car and to build a partner network,” Fourgeaud lists. Scarlet Motors was launched in August 2012, but prior to that, a lot of work had already been done to create the team and the technology. The car’s design language is now complete, and a prototype is currently under construction. “Unlike people tend to think, technology is not the biggest challenge,” Fourgeaud says. “In the midst of all the excitement, the most important thing is to maintain a clear goal and keep the product as simple as possible.” When asked when the car will be ready to hit the roads, Fourgeaud refuses to give any forecasts. “The car will be ready in due course. We have learned from our past experiences that it’s more important to focus on quality and to spend as much time on the development work as it requires rather than try to carry out a project as fast as possible.” In Fourgeaud’s view, the future of electric cars is promising — once the technology and the attitudes have matured. “When smartphones were launched, they were seen as products intended for a small, specific target group, the equipment and data connections were considered expensive and the number of services limited.” “Since then, the situation has changed,” Fourgeaud says. “Today, the majority of people have smartphones. The costs have come down and a myriad of useful applications is available. Electric cars may still be in their early stages, but thanks to their energy efficiency, they will rapidly gain ground over time.” In addition to new electric car companies, such as Scarlet Motors, an increasing number of conventional car manufacturers are introducing electric vehicles to the market. “Consumers are being provided with a broader selection of products, and competition drives the market forward,” Fourgeaud says. “The significant increase in charging points will also boost interest in electric cars during the next few years.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/the-future-of-aviation-part-i-a-smooth-ride-or-turbulence-ahead/,"The Future of Aviation, Part I: A smooth ride or turbulence ahead?","Aviation is undergoing a rapid transformation. Its development will be affected by both long-term megatrends and changes and phenomena affecting the industry itself. What lies ahead for the industry? Will the ride be smooth or full of turbulence? “It is difficult to conceive of breakthroughs and changes in the international operating environment of commercial aviation without an understanding of the industry’s history,” says   a special adviser at  , the Finnish Transport Safety Agency. Many present-day challenges related to the market situation are rooted in the fact that air traffic was for a long time a closed operating environment and the markets were highly regulated financially. This laid the foundation for the business environment of major national airline companies, who were strategic pawns of their states; traffic rights were being traded between governments. As a result of the gradual dismantling of financial regulation, the markets began to free up for the start of commercial air traffic beginning in the 1990s― especially in Europe. Following this revolution, so-called cheap airline companies began to arrive on the scene, putting traditional airlines in a position of having to reassess their heavy organisational structures and swollen cost bases.  Along with the relaxed regulations, Vuola says air traffic has also been shaken by external events and phenomena, such as the New York terrorist attacks, the war in Iraq, the SARS epidemic, the rising price of oil, the economic recessions of the 2000s, the volcanic-ash eruption in Iceland and the tsunami in Japan. “Air traffic has proved time and time again how highly sensitive it is to economic fluctuations and worldwide phenomena in a globalised world. Even the global awakening to climate change has played a part, reflected in the form of more stringent regulations on environmental impacts,” Vuola says. The current decade will be characterised by global competition, which will be intensified by the overcapacity problems that are inherent in air traffic for historical reasons. The high price of oil will continue to burden airlines with rising cost levels and will be partly responsible for their poor profitability. Although making predictions about the future is difficult, Trafi’s research data reveals certain trends. It can be expected, for example, that air traffic will continue to grow and will become more commonplace, despite its poor environmental image. The price of oil will rattle air traffic in future, too, and the number of airline companies will decline.  “It is safe to assume that the focus of airline traffic will switch to, for example, the Middle East, the current hub of activity for many major and up-and-coming airline companies. Growth in demand for air travel in Asia is also expected to affect future air traffic, spurred on by an emerging middle class and growth in prosperity,” says Vuola. According to aircraft manufacturer Boeing, air traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of around five per cent until 2030, which translates into a two-fold increase in volumes compared to the 2011 level. In more mature markets, such as Europe and North America, growth will remain moderate, whereas in Latin America and the Caribbean, market growth is expected to be strong. Vuola points out that in terms of supply and demand for airline travel, Finland as a market area is small. Air traffic is, however, very important for Finnish business, since geographically speaking, the country is an island. “Because of our location, Helsinki–Vantaa Airport can serve as a junction point for air traffic en route to Asia. For Finnish airline companies, that is a key advantage. It is also important for Finnish companies who target business in Asia,” Vuola says."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/vast-markets-for-wood-based-construction/,Vast markets for wood-based construction,"The roots of wood construction in Finland run deep, but there is still room for growth, especially in new apartment building construction and in renovations, as well as in public-sector construction. The outlook for exports also looks bright. Forestry is an important industry for the entire Finnish economy and constitutes one fifth of the nation’s export revenues. Forests generate more than 100 million cubic metres of wood annually, 55 per cent of which is utilised. “Wood construction’s significance in creating wellbeing through forestry is greater than its volume suggests: it is the source of raw material supply for the whole forest industry, says  , managing director of  . “The use of wood in construction is linked to considerable growth opportunities.” “Sooner or later, the whole world will have to switch to using renewable natural resources and accept that they can only be used to the extent that they are renewed,” adds   from  . “Wood is a good example of a sustainably used, renewable natural resource that continues to store carbon when used as a construction material, consumes little energy and results in low carbon dioxide emissions.” Almost every Finnish leisure home is built from wood. Wood is used in around 40 per cent of all new building construction, and in some 80 per cent of single-family-house construction. In industrial, warehouse and business premise construction, wood accounts for 15–20 per cent, whereas the share of wood used in apartment building construction is less than one per cent. “The use of wood can potentially be greatly increased particularly in new apartment building construction and renovations, and in public-sector, industrial, warehouse, and agricultural construction, as well as in bridges,” Viljakainen stresses. Säilä agrees. “In Sweden, for example, 20 per cent of all apartment buildings are wood-framed. Finland could achieve at least the same relative shares as its neighbour to the west.” Today, log buildings in particular are exported globally, not to mention wood components that end up in construction one way or another. Viljakainen and Säilä agree that in the vast, worldwide construction-product markets, there is demand for technologically high-level Finnish wood know-how. “Tremendous potential exists, also for high-level design solutions. The use of wood is increasing in global construction, both for environmental reasons and because of dwindling natural resources, and this, in turn, is creating new opportunities for Finnish industry,” Viljakainen says. In recent years, Finland has seen positive development where wood construction is concerned: fire regulations have been amended, industry has introduced new products in the markets, municipalities are planning areas consisting of wooden apartment buildings, and new competencies have emerged in the industry. New energy-efficiency regulations are also promoting the use of renewable energy in construction. “The future looks extremely bright for Finnish wood construction,” says Säilä."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/how-a-round-log-house-gets-smart/,How a round-log house gets smart,"Within half a century, log house construction has experienced quite a revolution: traditional round-log cabins have evolved into today’s modern smart homes. Public construction and exports are two special growth areas. The material’s environmental friendliness also adds to the appeal. “The development of industrial-scale log house construction in Finland began in the 1960s and 1970s, when Finns migrated to cities to find work, still wanting to spend their holidays in the peace and quiet of the countryside. This created a massive need for leisure homes,” says    , chairman of the board of the Finnish Log House Association   (HTT). In the 1980s, log house manufacturers started to focus on single-family homes, mainly intended for a country setting. In the 2000s, single-family home construction started to concentrate on cities and suburbs, as a result of which log house designs were revamped to fit their urban surroundings. “Along with the recent mould and indoor climate problems found in daycare centres and schools, logs have also emerged in public construction as a technically secure and safe building material,” Poijula says. Poijula is a firm believer in the bright future of log construction. “As an ecologically sound, renewable natural material that stores carbon dioxide, logs are in growing demand. Finland is home to the world’s technologically most advanced log house industry and the world’s largest log house factories.” A modern log building is highly energy-efficient. The by-products from the factories, such as wood bark, chips and sawdust, provide renewable energy that can be utilised in the production of heat and electricity in larger quantities than consumed by the entire manufacturing process all the way from the forest to the finished house. “This is something that no other construction material in the world can achieve.” Log buildings worth roughly 100 million euros are being exported annually, mainly to Russia, but also to Japan and the EU region. As far as demand is concerned, in Poijula’s view the sky’s the limit. “Volumes are dictated more by the competitiveness of Finnish industry than by the level of demand.” The collection launched at the beginning of this year by   represents the state of the art in today’s log house construction. It focuses not only on modern architecture, but also on the latest building services. Talobit, based in Oulu in Northern Finland, brings to the table a comprehensive smart home solution that not only saves energy, but also increases safety. “Today’s ecological and healthy log houses have all of the possibilities offered by modern building services at their disposal,” says    , managing director of the strongly growing company Talobit. Three years of product development resulted in an innovative service package including a Talobit studio, which provides the customer with a real-life, first-hand experience of the environment and the opportunity to compare various lighting, entertainment technology, household automation and water fixture options, for example. “Good pre-planning is also useful from the architectural perspective: all the equipment required for a smart home can be concealed, as the routing channels for wiring are pre-installed in the log frame at the factory,” Paananen explains."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/wood-is-back-in-town/,Wood is back in town,"Industrialisation, innovative solutions and ecological values make the construction of wooden apartment buildings a competitive and attractive option. From the viewpoint of wood, the present possibilities offered by urban construction look good. The aim of the National Wood Construction Programme, launched by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy last year and set to continue into 2015, is to minimise the carbon footprint of construction and to significantly increase the use of Finnish wood. “We want to make the combination of high-quality architecture and design with environmentally aware and energy-efficient construction into an international Finnish wood construction brand,” says development manager   from the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. “Our goal is to increase the market share of wooden apartment buildings in new apartment production from about one per cent to 10 per cent. Additionally, the export value of, for instance, processed wood products is set to double from half a million euros to one million.” Finland’s largest wood construction project so far was started up towards the end of last year through a project involving the co-operation of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, Aalto University and the City of Espoo. The project’s objective is to develop modern Finnish wood construction. Pilot buildings will be erected in Otaniemi, Tapiola and Keilaniemi in Espoo. “What is unique about the project is that it combines the city’s intent and determined decisions to promote wood construction with the university’s comprehensive research and product development and the Ministry’s policies concerning the promotion of the utilisation of Finnish wood,” Karjalainen sums up. Environmental awareness increases the demand for and the competitiveness of the local ecological construction material in large-scale construction and city environments. The export outlook, for example to Russia, is promising. “Environmental issues are causing the inevitable growth of wood construction. Finns need to be on the frontlines of this development,” Karjalainen adds. Wood City, a world-class wooden city block, will be built in Jätkäsaari in Helsinki. Once completed, it will be a showcase of urban wood construction and environmentally friendly construction technology. Work is expected to begin in 2014. “This is the modern return of wood to urban construction. The project represents expertise that will promote Finnish design, construction and architecture as well as the networking of the operators in the field, both in Finland and globally,” says  ’s executive vice president, Wood Products  . The wooden structures for Wood City will be based on Stora Enso’s Urban MultiStorey concept consisting of solid wood boards and elements. The concept has been developed together with  , which is in charge of the construction. The wooden city block will consist of office, residential, hotel and business premises. According to Kasurinen, the structural benefits of solid wood are at their best precisely in the construction of multi-storey buildings. “Wood is also pleasant for both mind and body,” Kasurinen says. “It creates an agreeable acoustic and visual environment, evens out the moisture variations in indoor air and, according to studies, even calms pulse rates.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/new-materials-save-the-environment/,New materials save the environment,"New environmentally friendly materials offer Finnish industry significant new opportunities. In terms of packaging materials, the potential is in the range of billions of euros. The   Technical Research Centre of Finland has developed several eco-friendly and innovative composite fibre materials that are based on pulp fibre, sawdust, flax, hemp, reed canarygrass, and fibre from the surface layer of peat, to name a few. “We have become experts in understanding these materials and how to process them. In many projects, we have reached the finish line, meaning we have attained essentially functional materials that can be applied to consumer products,” says  , a research scientist at VTT. “Fibre-based packaging materials include both transparent paper and modifiable board. These materials have reached the pilot phase and their potential has been examined by commercial actors,” says research professor  . Roughly five per cent of oil consumption today goes towards the manufacture of plastics, and plastics account for some 40 per cent of packaging. Thanks to the method developed by VTT, the oil used in the manufacture of plastic packages is replaced with renewable raw materials. “Consumers don’t see the difference, but it reduces the carbon footprint. Carbon dioxide emissions from bio-based plastics can be as much as 80 per cent smaller than emissions from oil-based plastics, but in practice the figure is slightly more conservative,” Harlin says. Although most oil-based materials can be replaced with bio-based materials, the latter still releases some emissions during the manufacturing process. The volume of emissions from bio-based materials, however, is often half that of oil-based materials. The shift to promoting bio-based materials should also be encouraged through legislation. “Bio-based plastics so far make up only about half a per cent of all plastics, but annual production and demand are growing strongly at a rate of approximately 25 per cent,” explains Immonen. Harlin believes that the new materials will offer Finnish industry significant opportunities through re-orientation. “The manufacture of fibre packages is sufficiently close to paper and board manufacturing technology, so it can be adopted quickly. In terms of packaging materials, we’re talking about potential in the range of billions of euros annually,” Harlin points out. Immonen believes Finland’s plastic products industry is very agile and can thus take control of new types of material at a very fast rate. New investments are not needed, as the materials can be processed using the existing plastic processing methods. “It all hinges on suitable and well-marketed products targeted at environmentally aware consumers,” Immonen says. “New fibre composite materials can open up even substantial markets for Finnish companies, in the areas of both packaging and in the construction and transport vehicle industry.” Some examples can already be seen in, for instance, the composite materials used in new cars. Some of the Finnish products Immonen points to as examples are LunaComp Deck, an outdoor decking material made of 100 per cent recycled wood materials, UPM’s ProFi composite products made of recycled materials, the Flaxwood guitar, which contains bio-composite materials, and most recently, Puustelli’s Miinus kitchen concept based on natural fibre composites."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/composites-resonate-with-customers/,Composites resonate with customers,"In recent years, natural fibre composite has found its way into musical instruments. The Finnish guitar manufacturer Flaxwood is already making a name for itself globally. The resonant material also corresponds with the demands of sustainable development. The development work around natural fibre composite began at the end of the 1990s in Northern Karelia, Finland, as part of a comprehensive project financed by the European Social Fund. The project supports material, instrument construction and musical expertise already present in the region. “First came the material, which we noticed was acoustically suitable for musical instruments. As a result of development work we decided to focus on electric guitars. We manufactured the first guitar in 2002 and our range of guitars was launched in the markets in 2005, explains  ’s managing director  . In the early days,   was in charge of material development. Today its production line and brand are owned by  . Following years of R & D, Flaxwood has tested new materials and also uses the materials of other Finnish composite manufacturers in its products. Flaxwood has patented its application, i.e. the use of natural composite fibres in musical instruments. From the very beginning the company has set its sights on the global markets, which they have found in Europe, the US and Japan. Over the years the company has developed other products in addition to electric guitars. In 2009, a novel Flaxwood guitar hybrid model was revealed in which a wooden body is combined with a composite neck. The company also manufactures composite parts for other instruments such as violins, basses and drums. “In future, our net sales will increase due to subcontracting work in manufacturing composite parts for the global instrument markets,” Karppinen says. “Developing and manufacturing electric guitars will of course continue as our other business area. This year we intend to conquer significant new territory in subcontracting, something which we are, however, unable to discuss at this point in time.” Kareline’s materials are natural fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites suitable for injection moulding. Environmentally friendly softwood pulp is used as the reinforcing fibre and carefully selected thermoplastics are used according to the end use. “The characteristics of a softwood pulp and plastic composite are better than those of ordinary plastic. The material combines the best qualities of natural fibres or minerals with plastic,” says  , general manager of Plasthill. “Traditional wood used for instruments, such as ebony and rosewood, are threatened species and a dwindling natural resource. Thanks to natural fibre composite we no longer need to fell rainforest trees, so the new material also incorporates the idea of sustainable development,” Karppinen continues. “Even though we are taking on traditional handicraft traditions, we have been able to prove that the material works wonderfully in musical instruments. Nobody has ever questioned the quality, sound or feel of the instruments.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/designers-inspired-by-wood/,Designers inspired by wood,"Wood is a fascinating and inspirational material for designers. Proof of that are at least Helsinki’s wooden Chapel of Silence (Hiljaisuuden kappeli) and the soon-to-be-completed public sauna ‘Kulttuurisauna’. The Chapel of Silence on the Narinkkatori Square next to the Kamppi Center in downtown Helsinki is a showcase of innovative timber architecture. Offering a place to meet and retreat, it also represents novel service design. The chapel was inaugurated at the end of May last year as part of the World Design Capital Helsinki 2012 programme. The chapel was designed by  ,   and   from  . “Designing the chapel was something unique for us. The timber structures gave us the possibility to study shapes, structures and different finishes, which is particularly important in creative and experimental projects,” Summanen says. “What makes wood interesting is its versatility. It is an architectural all-rounder, perfect for everything from building frames and facades to interior cladding and furnishings. The uniqueness of wood also lies in its emotional characteristics: it touches people through its colour, texture and scent,” he continues. With Finland’s long history in timber construction, experience in both design and building is not in short supply. However, Summanen says wood could be used in more diverse ways than today by, for example, opting for the less common wood species. The Kamppi Chapel of Silence features Finnish spruce on the outside walls and alder in the interior walls. The designer needs to understand wood’s characteristics as a living material and take into consideration the management of the moisture content of the material and the life cycle of the timber structures. Kulttuurisauna will be completed in Hakaniemenranta on the Helsinki waterfront in early spring. In addition to a sauna, the building will accommodate a small cafeteria, a small private room and an office. “Wood is a fine traditional construction material. It is also a renewable and sustainable material – reason enough for it to be used more extensively than today,” Summanen says. In late February, early March, Hakaniemenranta on the Helsinki waterfront is bustling with activity: the sauna designed by the architect-designer couple   and   is nearing completion. The public sauna is expected to become one of the city’s new attractions. Kulttuurisauna is a blend of urban and down-to-earth vibes. Located next to the high-rise concrete housing blocks of Merihaka, Kulttuurisauna still offers the possibility to take a dip in the sea, be it summer or winter. A birch was left standing in the inner courtyard of the sauna. Toivonen and Tsuboi are not only the designers but also the developers, owners and operators of the sauna. “The building bears testimony to traditional Finnish sauna culture, design and sustainable energy solutions. Its carbon footprint is negligible,” Toivonen says. The building’s energy system was developed together with the energy company Fortum. The sauna is powered by bioenergy, sun and water. The stove is heated by wood pellets, and the residual and after-heat is recovered to heat other spaces."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/graphene-is-on-its-way/,Graphene is on its way,"Graphene, described as the world’s strongest material, is quickly making its way onto the scene. This year it will already be possible to utilise the super-material in sports equipment. The substance holds almost limitless application possibilities. The history of graphene is a colourful one, according to the Finnish professor  . The material was discovered decades ago, but the final breakthrough came in 2004 when researchers at the University of Manchester invented a simple method for extracting individual graphene flakes and proved that they had interesting physical properties. In relation to its weight, graphene is up to 300 times stronger than steel. At the same time graphene is flexible, light and transparent and has excellent thermal and electrical conductivity. “As graphene can be manufactured from almost any raw material that contains carbon, it can be considered a nearly infinite resource,” Kinaret says. “It can be used to replace other rare materials in many applications. For example indium, a fairly limited natural resource, is a common material in today’s touchscreens.” By combining its many properties, graphene can be used to create new applications such as flexible transparent electronics, new composite materials and novel types of batteries. The applications will mature at different times. “Among the first applications to appear will be composite materials in, for example, sports equipment, probably already this year, while the more demanding fast electronics applications will take years, perhaps even a decade, to achieve maturity,” Kinaret says. “Somewhere between the two, battery technology and sensor technology products will make their appearance. At a later date medical applications will enter the picture.” Kinaret is heading a comprehensive graphene research project starting up in the autumn. Its goal is to develop new graphene-based technologies and to ensure that the results of European graphene research will benefit Europeans in the form of new products and jobs. The study, co-ordinated by Chalmers University of Technology, has been selected as the EU’s second flagship project. The project is set to receive one billion euros in funding over the next decade.  Technical Research Centre of Finland is also aboard. “We are involved in a work package led by Nokia in which we are developing graphene components and their manufacturing techniques from the perspective of flexibility, transparency and stretchability,” explains senior scientist   from VTT. “The study covers every component used in mobile devices from screens, energy storage and signal transmission to individual components such as solar cells.” VTT expects the co-operation with other European research institutions and companies to be fruitful. The objective is to improve the competitiveness of Finnish industry. “New applications that would be impossible to implement using other materials are quickly springing up around graphene,” Arpiainen says. “In Finland, certain equipment manufacturers are already benefiting from the increase in demand brought about by the graphene research project.” “Our close involvement in developing manufacturing technologies and applications ensures our future expertise. As a result, we will be able to give birth to new industry.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/nano-and-materials-meet/,Nano and materials meet,"Nano materials offer companies a myriad of commercial opportunities. One of Finland’s spearheads is the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technology, which is used in the production of solar cells, for example. Nano can also make materials more environmentally friendly. Well over 200 companies in Finland have products drawing on nanotechnology. “We have been successful in developing and commercialising new nanomaterials,” says senior technology adviser   from  . Co-operation between research institutes and companies has resulted in major breakthroughs in the utilisation of the nanoscale properties of materials. According to Lämsä, superior competitiveness has been achieved on international markets by combining expertise with advanced production methods, such as ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) or R2R (Roll to Roll). “Due to the limited size of the domestic market, Finnish nanotechology companies have focused their commercial efforts on international markets early in the process,” Lämsä explains. “We have also been able to create insightful partnerships with international operators, such as companies, universities and financiers.” One of the Finnish success stories is  , founded in 2005, which designs and manufactures nanotechnology-based coating equipment for the production of solar cells and flexible electronics, among other applications. Over 95 per cent of the company’s 18 million euros in net sales comes from exports. “The film we manufacture improves the efficiency of the cells or increases the life of the product by preventing water, dirt and other factors threatening the product’s life from penetrating into the sensitive components,” says CEO  . In an attempt to get an extra boost from Russia, the company is in the process of establishing a joint research unit with a university based in St. Petersburg. Ahonen expects the joint research activities to allow Beneq to gain additional resources for developing its products. “The products and solutions are being sold across the globe, but thin film technologies also play a major role for the future of the Russian economy and modernisation in the country,” Ahonen says. Nanotechnology offers an array of environmentally friendly applications. At the production stage, it enables considerable savings in materials consumption. Nanomaterials can also replace rare metals used in the electronics industry, for example. Nanotechnology can improve the efficiency of solar cells and windmills, reduce transfer losses and make energy recovery more efficient. Nanocomposites are lightweight, yet extremely strong, thus making it possible to minimise the total weight of vehicles and reduce fuel consumption. “The environmental benefits of nanotechnology are unquestionable, if they are realised,” says  , from the  . “That is why, when developing nanomaterials, it is important to take into account their possible negative effects on the environment and health as early as possible in the process.” “According to research, most nanomaterials are likely to be harmless to the environment and human health or only present minimal harm,” Sillanpää says. “Against this backdrop, the development of measuring techniques and methods is currently one of the critical focus areas of research.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/learning-goes-digital/,Learning goes digital,"Information and communications technology has made its way into schools in recent years. Schools have good capabilities in place, but they still have their work cut out to put these capabilities into practical use. Finnish education know-how is currently experiencing growing demand also outside the country’s borders. Education technology encompasses, among other things, data networks, data connections, presentation technology, computers, tablets, various measuring devices, smartphones, software and teaching facilities. “Finnish schools have a fairly good infrastructure in place, i.e. data connections, hardware and software,” says  , senior adviser at the Finnish National Board of Education. “Data projectors can be found in almost every teaching room, the number of interactive whiteboards is higher than the European average and web-based learning platforms have also been purchased in high numbers. “This, coupled with the globally top-notch pedagogic expertise of Finnish teachers and the positive attitude of Finnish youth towards technology, provides a good starting point.” Despite the good starting point, surveys show that Finland has lost its place among the world’s leading developers and users of information and communications technology in teaching over the course of the 21st century. The situation looks somewhat brighter in upper secondary and vocational education than in basic education. “The problem lies in the subdued attitude of both teachers and students towards the use of information and communications technology in teaching and the utilisation of digital learning environments,” Koskinen says. “Expertise has clearly been concentrated: we have top experts, but on the other hand, there are still too many people who lack skills in this sector.” So far, Finland has mainly been drawing on foreign education technology. This is about to change, however. “During the past couple of years, Finnish technology companies have clearly taken an interest in developing education technology as well. Educational games, for example, can be a good business, and we have already witnessed some encouraging successes.” As a good example, Koskinen mentions  , a computer game designed for practising basic reading skills. The Finnish music-making game , for its part, promises to turn even inexperienced amateur composers into well-versed songwriters. A demand has emerged for Finnish training expertise and education technology in China and Russia, for example.   has turned out to be a particularly interesting market area due to the massive educational reform taking place in the country. For example, the Finnish companies 10monkeys.com, providing an e-learning environment for math, and Sanako, specialising in language education, concluded deals with Saudi Arabian operators in February. “Saudi Arabians have shown such a strong interest towards Finnish know-how that Finnish companies have been provided with good opportunities to embark on commercial co-operation with them,” says  , project coordinator at Future Learning Finland,  . “We have gained insight into their needs and learned how to meet them,” Lindholm says. “Most of our expertise in the field can be localised for Saudi Arabia. It can be anything from ICT expertise to teacher training. Finns have now also established contacts with the country and with the bodies making the purchase decisions, which will further boost training exports in the future."

The goal is, above all, to improve learning results,” says Santtu Toivonen, development manager at Sanoma Pro.  is an educational publisher that has been developing electronic learning environments in Finland for more than 10 years. Sanoma Pro’s OPIT is a package of digital education content designed for the needs of Finnish schools. “OPIT makes using information technology and the digital learning environment as easy as possible, in terms of both learning and teaching. User-friendliness, user support and the opportunity to advance step by step will continue to be keywords for us,” says Toivonen. Smart technology offers modern tools for social learning that come naturally to students. The contents follow the national curriculum, for all teaching levels – from preschool through to vocational education. Another service Sanoma Pro offers is the Teachers’ Online Service (Opettajan Työhuone), which contains supplementary material for various teaching subjects: for example, teaching guides, online teaching materials, editable and printable test material, transparency templates and online assignments for students. “Both services are very popular: OPIT has more than 170 000 and the Teachers’ Online Service more than 300 000 users in Finland,” Toivonen points out. “In the autumn we will take a major step forward when we merge these two separate services into a single, new-generation learning environment,” Toivonen adds. Right from the outset, Sanoma Pro has developed its services with the help of teachers and in co-operation with Sanoma Pro’s European subsidiaries. “Our goal is to improve the quality of teaching and to save time for teachers – not to replace them. Our services give teachers more time to be with their students during the school day,” explains Toivonen. Digital learning materials are still in their infancy, but they are gaining momentum. The equipment base varies greatly from school to school, but in the not-too-distant future that will change, too, as students will increasingly have their own devices on hand. “Digital learning material will undoubtedly replace printed materials. Digital books differ from printed textbooks in that they offer novel characteristics, such as digital notepads, multimedia content and audio files. In essence, the digital textbook is more than a printed book,” Toivonen sums up."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mika-anttonen-we-have-the-worlds-cleanest-biofuel/,Mika Anttonen: “We have the world’s cleanest biofuel”,"Mika Anttonen is holding a world-class product. Bioethanol, a fuel produced from waste, also fits the bill of meaningful work. “To make it in the global economy, a company must target leadership in its own segment. We ca noffer a world-class product,” Mika Anttonen says. Today, for the founder and chairman of the Board of the energy company  , ideological goals take precedence over financial ones. Anttonen boasts a successful career in the energy sector, where he “made money for 10 years,” as he puts it. “After the birth of my children, I reached a sort of turning point where I began to think about what I’d like to do when I grew up. Instead of making money, I felt the need to do something new and more meaningful,” Anttonen says. It was at the turn of the millennium. Long before the worldwide debate on climate change kicked off, Anttonen had given serious thought to the need to find alternatives for the ever-increasing consumption of oil, among other things. A myriad of ideas raced through his head, until the pieces slowly started to come together. “I had been following the development of biofuels for a long time. When the opportunity rose to produce bioethanol from waste, I realised that this was the wow factor I had been looking for. What’s more, it has the added bonus of combining two positive aspects: addressing the waste problem and reducing our dependence on oil,” Anttonen explains. St1’s spearhead project saw daylight about eight years ago. Today the company’s goal is to be a leading producer and seller of sustainable energy. It manufactures bioethanol from food industry waste, generates electricity through wind power and works with a number of renewable energy sources. RE85 contains 80–85 per cent of bioethanol, produced by St1 from Finnish food industry biowaste. In practical terms, the fuel manufacturing method does not release any fossil carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thanks to distributed production, transports are also minimised. RE85 can be used in the flexfuel models sold by various automobile manufacturers. There are 40 distribution stations in Finland. “The RE85 we produce from waste is the world’s cleanest biofuel. Bioethanol is widely being manufactured from crops, for example, but, as far as we know, we are the only ones using food industry waste as the raw material,” Anttonen says. According to Anttonen, Finland has in place the strictest legislation in the world, which has contributed to the development of biofuels. Once implemented, the legislation on second-generation biofuels that is being prepared in the EU will require energy companies to distribute biofuels, thus opening up the markets for St1. “In a few years’ time, we will know in which order we will go global,” Anttonen says. “We have invested in the right technology at the right time, and the future looks bright. We have a huge head start on others in this sector.” “However modestly I look at it, the market situation doesn’t look bad. We have our eyes set on conquering the world,” Anttonen concludes. RE85 marks a breakthrough in the development of environmentally friendly liquid fuels. The biowaste-based ethanol component in the fuel reduces fossil emissions from road traffic by up to 80 per cent."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/maths-served-up-on-a-new-platter/,Maths served up on a new platter,"At Martinlaakso Upper Secondary School in Finland, maths is being taught in new ways and on a more individual basis. This novel, individualised teaching method is part of an experimental project that also makes increased use of digital applications. And so far, it looks promising. , 10monkeys.com According to research, 20 per cent of students learn equally well in both teacher-led sessions and in one-on-one guided sessions; at the same time, however, 80 per cent of those students don’t perform up to their abilities. “Traditional teaching culture simultaneously puts the brakes on the education of gifted students while completely disregarding weaker students,” says teacher  . Bearing that in mind, Martinlaakso Upper Secondary School, under Peura’s lead, embarked on a journey to advance the teaching of maths. “The whole idea was sparked by teachers’ desire to better serve their pupils and to offer improved forms of teaching. After having taken several small steps, we realised that we had made a giant leap forward,” Peura says. The project resulted in the development of a teaching method for individual learning which Peura says has received high praise. It combines the best aspects of different teaching methods, making use of, for example, YouTube and teaching videos from the website Opetus.tv, and learning at one’s own pace and in small groups. In addition to teaching school subjects, the goal is also to teach social skills, communal learning and studying skills. “The teaching method is being applied in more than 20 learning institutions around Finland, and it is constantly expanding,” Peura says. “The experiment will gradually become permanent protocol, which essentially entails a shift in teaching culture.” With the introduction of the new teaching method, the work of teachers has shifted from guiding the masses and maintaining order and discipline to individually guiding pupils. It has made their work more enjoyable, and the sense of having to rush things has disappeared. “Interaction between teachers and students has increased, but the students have also learned how to figure things out on their own or solve challenging problems as a group,” Peura says. “The students’ self-confidence and belief in their own abilities have increased.” A number of applications have been created to assist studying. The Finnish website   last year launched a digital learning application for maths that was developed right from the start in collaboration with schools and teachers, under the support of universities. There is strong demand for products that respond to the needs of schools – both in Finland and globally. “With this application, children can do the exercises at their own pace. And when they are able to do them in a game-like environment also at home, their motivation reaches a new level. At the same time, their results improve,” says managing director of  ,  . “The feedback from students, teachers and parents has been extremely positive. People have particularly liked the graphics, ease of use and contents of the site,” she says. “The number of users is growing steadily. From next autumn on,   will also be used in schools in Saudi Arabia, and in future we will produce other maths teaching products in Arabic,” Björklund adds. 10monkeys.com is a Finnish learning application aimed at children aged six to 10 where they can perform basic maths exercises in a game-like environment."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/lappeenranta-home-of-the-next-generation-hybrid-bus/,Lappeenranta – home of the next generation hybrid bus,"Greener transport, electric vehicles and energy efficiency are inevitably making their way into our lives. One of the emerging technologies is the next generation hybrid bus, which challenges current technology and cuts emissions from public transport in cities by up to 50 per cent. The CAMBUS project involves Lappeenranta University of Technology, Saimaa University of Applied Sciences and South Karelia Vocational College (EKAMO). The project is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the City of Lappeenranta. Hybrid buses were introduced to Finland’s public transport system a few years ago. Experience shows that the fuel savings compared to a traditional diesel bus stand at around 30 per cent. Carbon dioxide emissions have been equally reduced, but the numbers involving particles and nitrogen oxides are even better. Now an all-new prototype of a hybrid bus suitable for public transport, CAMBUS, is in the making in Lappeenranta. “The bus will be installed with a new hybrid system developed by us, which offers a major improvement in energy efficiency compared to current commercial solutions,” says project manager,  . “The improved efficiency is based on a markedly smaller combustion engine and on larger battery capacity.” Current hybrid buses usually have a diesel engine with a cylinder displacement of around 10 litres, while the CAMBUS system runs on a 2.5-litre engine. When combined with a powerful battery system, this is a perfectly sufficient power source for a bus. Following the modifications, the bus can run on just the electric motor, just the combustion engine, or on a combination of both. According to Kasurinen, one of the benefits of the CAMBUS system is its versatility when compared to current hybrid buses. In current hybrid systems the electric motor assists the diesel engine, while in the CAMBUS version the situation is reversed. The CAMBUS bus is more reminiscent of an electric vehicle. The electric motor is powerful enough to run the bus without help from the diesel engine. Owing to the large battery capacity, the CAMBUS bus can be run solely on electricity in towns and cities, i.e. where emissions tend to be largest. When driving in less densely populated areas, the diesel engine can be used as a propulsion aid and for producing electricity. The diesel engine increases the operating range and, in comparison with an all-electric bus, reduces the need for recharging. “When charging can be performed using renewable energy sources, such as solar power, the CAMBUS bus can be run virtually emissions free,” Kasurinen says. The next generation bus is still in the works. The bus frame has been acquired and dismantled to the required extent. The planning of the new powertrain is in its final stages, and the manufacture of some components has been started. Actual installation will start in the autumn of this year, and the first test drives will be carried out in 2014. “The CAMBUS system can be modified to fit different types and makes of buses and machinery. As well as a hybrid bus that will break the mould of currently-available electric vehicles, a further aim of this project is to develop electrical machinery and frequency converters designed for drive transmission in industrial machinery that are suitable for product development,” Kasurinen explains. Another aim is to prove the performance of this type of a hybrid system and batteries under Finnish conditions. The future looks promising, and electric drives in vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. “Hybrid solutions already offer reductions in emissions as well as financial savings,” Kasurinen says. “As the battery technology evolves, traditional combustion engines will inevitably be overtaken by electric drives, both in terms of evolution and emissions, the limits for which are getting ever stricter. Competition in this field is tough, especially once major manufacturers fully realise the benefits of electrification.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/hydrogen-minimises-the-carbon-footprint-of-transportation/,Hydrogen minimises the carbon footprint of transportation,"“The hydrogen engine has taken off and there’s no stopping it now. We are strongly on board for the ride. Things are really starting to happen,” enthuses Kalevi Korjala, managing director of Woikoski. Hydrogen cars are powered by the electricity produced in their fuel cells. The fuel cell commonly produces electricity using hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is manufactured from water using electricity and is also a by-product of industry. Hydrogen cars do not consume oil or pollute because only electricity and water are released from the fuel cell. Korjala is referring to the Finnish Hydrogen Roadmap compiled by VTT and partly funded by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, which assesses what opportunities international development can open up for Finnish companies. The report envisions the types of energy, climate and industry policy opportunities that the widespread adoption of hydrogen energy has to offer. Woikoski’s hydrogen production dates back a century. Its hydrogen has been utilised in many applications from the cooling of power plant generators to the production processes of xylitol and margarine as well as the cutting of Iittala’s glasses and the heat treatment of Fiskars’ scissor blades. The company is now making record investments in, among other things, the refuelling stations for hydrogen cars that are based on its own technology. According to Korjala, a hydrogen-society approach has begun to surface during the past five years – including hydrogen-based transport applications. A factor boosting this trend is a decision by the European Union which states that cars utilising hydrogen fuel should be able to drive across Europe in 2020. “The testing of hydrogen fuel cells has been going on for some time,” Korjala says. “The ones in use now are already fifth generation devices and the serial production of the first hydrogen cars will start in 2015. Automobile manufacturers that have invested in hydrogen technology already have production lines in place.” “The markets need hydrogen producers and hydrogen refuelling stations in addition to hydrogen cars,” Korjala continues. “These are areas that we are focusing on through the record level of investments we are presently making. Next year we will inaugurate a new hydrogen plant in Kokkola and the hydrogen refuelling station technology that we have developed is already undergoing trials. We will also be acquiring a hydrogen car, which will be used to test how the hydrogen refuelling stations work in practice.” Today, a hydrogen car can go 600 kilometres on one refuelling. It takes approximately four minutes to fill up a tank that holds five to six kilograms of hydrogen, which is about the same as the time it takes to fill up a petrol or diesel-powered car. The carbon footprints differ greatly, however. “While diesel and petrol engines produce 150–160 grams of carbon dioxide for each kilometre driven, the corresponding figure for a hydrogen-powered fuel cell car is only five to eight grams,” Korjala explains. “When the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy, such as wind, wave or solar energy and a refuelling station is nearby, the carbon footprint shrinks down to nearly zero. The change brought on by hydrogen is dramatic.” Woikoski sees considerable business opportunities in hydrogen as it has promising export possibilities. Green thinking is taking over in Japan, China, Europe and the United States. “The business potential is huge, in the billions. Once hydrogen cars start replacing petrol and diesel vehicles, the sums will rise into the hundreds of billions,” Korjala concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/intelligence-personalises-public-transport/,Intelligence personalises public transport,"Personalised public transport makes it possible to travel almost door-to-door using shared transport. In Finland, Helsinki is leading the way on this development journey, but the trend is national. It’s all about optimisation, which will only continue to gain momentum in the future. Intelligent transport means utilising information and communication technologies in the transport system and in all transport modes. Intelligent transport provides guidance in making choices that are optimal in view of the big picture, thus improving the safety, smoothness, efficiency and eco-friendliness of the transport system. According to the vision of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, in 2020 the Finnish transport system will be one of the most advanced and efficient in the world. “The optimisation of public transport is about continuously developing operations, involving various measures from day-to-day planning to the creation of completely new products,” says    , director of Public Transport Planning Department at   (HSL). In this optimisation, tools offered by information technology enhance the quality of public transport planning. At HSL, current topics include the use of data based on geographic information, the automation of passenger counting and planning tools that facilitate the management of passenger volume information, among other things. The open data published by HSL, on the other hand, also makes work easier for various application developers. “At its most traditional, optimising the capacity of the public transport system means the new Sm5 commuter train Flirt, which is currently at the delivery stage. It was designed with a larger unit size than the previous commuter train types precisely in a bid to optimise passenger capacity,” Anttila explains. Today, public transport flows in the Helsinki region are highly optimised: traffic lights and bus stops detect the arrival of buses, and the Journey Planner finds the best route. The automation of the metro system represents a technically demanding optimisation project. Its objective is to shorten the time interval between metro trains compared to manually operated lines. The on-demand bus service represents a completely new public transport concept. “In the Kutsuplus project, on-demand buses use a highly efficient computer system to optimise traveling for customers by assembling people headed in approximately the same direction onto the same bus. The more buses and passengers are covered by this service, the more efficient will it be,” points out program director   from HSL. The three-year pilot phase of this demand-responsive service started in October last year. In practice, it complements the current public transport system by allowing transfer-free cross regional travel in which the departure and destination points are scattered across a large area. Additionally, Kutsuplus makes it possible to pick up customers close to their doorstep and take them to metro or train stations, for example. “Customers have been satisfied and their feedback has been encouraging. In the customer survey conducted on Valentine’s Day, 14 February, the service received an overall score of 4.6 on a scale of 1 to 5, says a clearly delighted Rissanen. In the future, intelligent transport concepts like Kutsuplus can be extended to cover the whole of Finland and smooth door-to-door travel chains can be created by combining the train connections and on-demand buses of different cities, for example. In the ideal scenario, the trip would be ordered and a single payment made to the entire chain. A smartphone would guide the passenger through the optimally planned transfers along the journey. “Intelligent transport is thus a means to assist individual passengers in reaching their destinations. At the same time, this will make the public transport offering more accessible in areas that lack a competitive alternative to private motoring,” Anttila points out. Anttila believes that innovations like Kutsuplus will profoundly reshape established travel patterns. For example, when a public WLAN connection can be provided to passengers, their workday can begin almost immediately after they step out of their front doors. The metro automation project will benefit customers above all through shorter waiting times. It will also balance passenger volumes in the cars and improve travel comfort, as both the trains themselves and their travel intervals will be shorter than at present. In addition, the construction costs for metro stations will be lower than before, as the stations can be designed based on the new shorter trains. Good News from Finland tested Kutsuplus:"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/renewable-diesel-from-finland-part-1-neste-oils-record-number-of-raw-materials/,"Renewable diesel from Finland, part 1: Neste Oil’s record number of raw materials","Biofuels produced from renewable resources are making traffic greener. The energy company Neste Oil is the only producer of renewable diesel in the world that utilises more than 10 different raw materials. The use of waste and residue materials has increased significantly in recent years. The energy company Neste Oil is presently the world’s only producer of biofuel that is capable of producing renewable diesel from more than 10 different raw materials. Within the space of five years,   has shaped its renewable fuel products into a business that brings in net sales of more than 2 billion euros. During the first quarter of this year, the company achieved its first positive result from renewable fuels, equalling some 26 million euros. “The renewable NExBTL diesel fuel is sold as a premium-quality biocomponent to corporate customers in Europe and the US. In Finland, Neste Oil has been selling fuel containing a minimum of 10 per cent renewable NExBTL diesel to consumers since 2008,” says  , vice president, Renewable Fuels at Neste Oil. NExBTL diesel can be produced from palm oil, its refinement by-products stearin and palm oil fatty acid distillate, rapeseed oil, jatropha oil, camelina oil, soybean oil, waste animal fat from the food industry and waste fat from the fish processing industry. “In 2012, we produced enough renewable diesel to keep more than two million cars running for a year,” Hietala says. “In compliance with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive and the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s sustainability criteria, we are committed to procuring only certified sustainably produced raw materials that are fully traceable to the plantation or production location.” The production of raw materials for biofuels is carefully regulated. Raw materials can only be produced in strictly specified areas that do not threaten natural resources. European legislation excludes, without exception, areas in which the produced raw materials are not suitable for the production of biofuels. These include biodiverse and carbon-rich areas. “Through full traceability we ensure that only acceptable raw materials are refined,” Hietala says. Expanding the raw material base is one of the key goals of Neste Oil’s R & D work: approximately 70 per cent of the company’s R & D costs are focused on research related to renewable raw materials. According to the company, the most interesting candidates for new raw materials are the waste flows from oil plants, the waste flow from ethanol production and used frying fat. “Our long-term raw material research is focused on utilising microbial oil produced from waste as well as microalgae oil as raw materials for renewable fuels,” Hietala explains. “Both raw materials have already been used to produce renewable NExBTL diesel in laboratory conditions.” Neste Oil’s refineries can also produce renewable aviation fuel, the first delivery of which was to Lufthansa in 2011. In 2012, the company expanded its product range further by launching the commercial production and sales of renewable naphtha to corporate customers. “Renewable naphtha can be used, for example, in the chemical industry as a raw material for bioplastics and as a biocomponent in gasoline. Naphtha is a by-product of refining operations in Finland, Holland and Singapore. We have also initiated studies looking into the commercialisation of renewable solvents,” Hietala concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/renewable-diesel-from-finland-part-2-upm-is-a-wood-based-diesel-pioneer/,"Renewable diesel from Finland, part 2: UPM is a wood-based diesel pioneer","The world’s first biorefinery manufacturing wood-based renewable diesel will start operating in Finland next year. Forest company UPM’s eco-project will manufacture the fuel from tall oil, which offers a greener option to traditional fuels. Both EU-level regulations and national legislation require that biofuels and renewable energy be taken into use in traffic. The share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of traffic must equal at least 10% of the final consumption of traffic energy in all EU member states by 2020. Finland has decided to boost the use of biofuels in traffic on an accelerated timetable and with a 20 per cent commitment. “Finland is a pioneer in the production and development of advanced biofuels. We have been able to make use of our solid, traditional technology know-how and raw materials in a novel way,” says  ’s vice president, UPM Biofuels Business Area,  . “Biofuels represent possibly the greatest opportunity we have to renew the use of Finnish wood and forest industry process waste, which will simultaneously enable the achievement of demanding environmental objectives,” Kukkonen continues. Just recently, UPM and VTT have jointly initiated the first fleet tests of the renewable diesel, UPM BioVerno, in traffic. The fleet tests will study the effect of the diesel on the car’s engines, emissions and consumption. “The results from the tests are not yet available, but based on previous tests, we can say that this is an innovation that will reduce greenhouse emissions by up to 80 per cent when compared with fossil fuels,” says Kukkonen. Wood-based diesel offers a global solution for reducing both greenhouse gas emissions from traffic and our dependency on oil. According to Kukkonen, biofuels are the only effective and pragmatic method for decreasing traffic emissions, in addition to improving the energy efficiency of vehicles. EU legislation favours the use of renewable raw materials that do not compete with food production or increase land use. This helps to augment the demand for biofuels developed according to sustainable development principles. “Sustainable wood-based fuels offer a considerable step forward in our fight against climate change because the availability of the raw material is much better than that of other second generation biofuels,” says Kukkonen. UPM BioVerno, to be launched on the markets in 2014, recently won the Sustainability Award 2013 for Breakthrough Innovation in Technology 2013 in Rotterdam. “Our goal is to grow into a major refiner of second generation traffic biofuel. Our 150 million euro biorefinery investment under construction in Lappeenranta is, at present, the most important new forest industry investment in Finland,” Kukkonen concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/mikko-hypponen-knows-cyber-threats/,Mikko Hyppönen knows cyber-threats,"Following the bombshell news in the US about systematic surveillance on popular websites by US intelligence agencies, Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer for F-Secure, became an even busier man. As usual, demand for the expert’s statements on the matter was high. Prying into web users’ business infuriates Hyppönen. The recent news bombshell proved that international internet espionage and electronic communications data surveillance are serious and real cyber-threats. “The PRISM program used in the US for surveillance is a worrisome example of how a government can abuse its authority on the internet,” Hyppönen says. “By monitoring data communications in the rest of the world, the program chips away at everyone’s privacy.” Hyppönen can be called a data guru, and with good reason. The research officer, who started working for the data security company   in 1991, is known in Finland and abroad as a sought-after data security expert, speaker and performer. Hyppönen has been a member of the Computer Antivirus Research Organization since 1995. In 2011 he was ranked 61st in  ’s list of the Top 100 Global Thinkers. The magazine described him as “a leading expert on cybersecurity”. Hyppönen is a prime example of Finnish know-how and pioneering status in the sector. “Considering its size, Finland has an incredibly extensive data security sector,” Hyppönen says. “For decades now we have also had an exceptional amount of training in the sector and, as a result, a high level of competence in it. Our recent  , which we can use as an example for the rest of the world, also attests to this.” Hyppönen points out that when Finns communicate using Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook.com, Facebook and Twitter or when they exchange files on, for example, Dropbox, the majority of the messages travel via the US. “Windows users also face the threat of automated exploit kit malware tools from websites, which increase the vulnerability of software programs,” Hyppönen says. “Even in the mobile world, Android users are increasingly coming into contact with malware.” According to Hyppönen, every web user today is exposed to threats, and the situation is not likely to improve in the future. Hyppönen again urges people to protect themselves in every possible way: “Be sure to back-up your computers, tablets and mobile phones so that even if your house burns to the ground, you can still get your data back,” Hyppönen advises. “Update your system, meaning make sure that all operating systems and system software in your devices are always the latest ones offered. It’s also a good idea to install a security product for added protection against cyber-threats.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/cybersecurity-is-an-asset/,Cybersecurity is an asset,"“A good cyber-operating environment improves Finland’s international appeal as an investment target. What we’re talking about is a new business area that is gaining momentum and will also introduce high-competence jobs,” says Mikko Kosonen, president of Sitra. “The fact that cyber-operations are governed by the logic of competence and not by the logic of scale plays in Finland’s favour,” says Mikko Kosonen of Sitra. Kosonen has headed the cross-administrative cybersecurity strategy working group since 2011, which is when the decision to draw up the strategy as part of the security strategy of Finnish society as a whole was made. The strategy, completed early this year, is not the first of its kind, according to Kosonen, but it was devised concertedly with other Western countries. “What makes the Finnish strategy so progressive is its strong focus on the opportunities offered by the cyber-operating environment and on co-operation between a broad range of different actors in society,” says Kosonen. “The strategy can be considered the first comprehensive strategy that approaches cybersecurity from the perspective of society as a whole. This has sparked tremendous interest – even on a global scale.” The vision put forth in the Finnish Government’s decision-in-principle is for Finland to be a worldwide forerunner in preparing against cyber-threats and in controlling the disruptions they cause by the year 2016. “The vision for the cybersecurity strategy, as well as its strategic policies, will define the framework for practical measures, through which the objectives will be made concrete,” explains Kosonen. “The action plan expected by the end of the year will state the practical tasks for various administrative sectors and for other critical actors in our society. “The Finnish concept engages the commitment of all of society to develop all aspects of cybersecurity in a mutually agreed manner. One might say that cyber-security is only as strong as its weakest link,” he says. When it comes to responding to the data security challenges faced by ordinary internet users, Finland has stressed the importance of data security for a long time now. The objective of the new cybersecurity strategy is to ensure the undisturbed continuation of critical infrastructure, above all, in terms of wellbeing. The goal of cybersecurity is to safeguard our electronic and networked society. Although cyber-threats generally target the digital world, their impacts may also reach the physical world. Through the policies of the cybersecurity strategy and the measures required to realise them, Finland will be able to control, and respond to, the adverse effects of the cyber-environment. Finland has a long tradition of intense and confidential public–private partnership, and of co-operation between administrative sectors. Cybersecurity is based on extensive preparation that encompasses all of society and its various actors. Its realisation requires a highly educated population, internationally successful data security business operations and high-quality research work conducted in universities and research institutions. “The fact that cyber-operations are governed by the logic of competence and not by the logic of scale plays in Finland’s favour,” Kosonen sums up. “Finland is a modern data society in which digitality and top technology carry their own risks. A data society is dependent on the operation of data networks and systems, and is therefore also very vulnerable to disruptions to them. “Since there are no limits to cyber-threats, everyone working with cybersecurity should know what everyone else is doing and what kind of threats they face. This is why we need shared situational awareness, which will be the mandate of the national cybersecurity centre that will be launched next year.”"

Thanks to this non-electric innovation, food can be kept chilled for 4–5 days, even during the hottest days of summer. The brains behind the innovation is the Tuusula-based company  , which specialises in cooling solutions for airline catering. According to Icebridge’s CEO  , the non-electric cooling system developed by the company can be used in many different applications, such as in cooler bags. “In practice, the basic product is ready but the product for the consumer market is still undergoing a few adjustments,” Hämäläinen says. “We aim to complete the development work by the end of the year.” The most noticeable benefit of the innovation, which is dubbed the ‘super cooler bag’, over traditional cooler bags is its long-lasting and reliable temperature control. The product is designed for conditions in which electric or otherwise-powered refrigeration space is not available or is insufficient. “Our product is especially suited for travel, long hiking trips, staying at the summer cottage, sailing excursions and other kinds of events such as festivals,” explains Hämäläinen. “The basic model will cost a couple of hundred euros, while the deluxe version will cost more,” Hämäläinen says. “Our product is aimed at a small specialist market, so we’re not looking to compete with cheap polystyrene and plastic cooler boxes. In our version, high quality is matched with attractive design.” “According to market analysis, there will be a global demand for our product,” Hämäläinen continues. “Our latest projections suggest that the largest markets are in the Middle East and in North America. Several rival products are available on the market but there is nothing with the same characteristics.” Icebridge’s flagship product is a non-electric refrigeration system for airline catering based on, among other things, patented technology developed by inventor  . The system cools the serving trolley evenly and for a sustained period, meaning that food can be kept cool for up to 23 hours. The feedback from 10 airlines who are clients of Icebridge has been extremely positive. Dutch airline KLM, for one, has openly expressed its satisfaction. “The airline has been flying with Icebridge coolers for almost a year and a half and made tens of thousands of flights without any surprises. The company has calculated that the product has helped to save 1.2 million euros per year.” As the technology can be used for countless applications, what might be the company’s next conquest in the refrigeration arena? “We’re going to keep some things up our sleeve… We have a lot of material but we’re going to move forwards one step at a time.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/peter-von-bagh-the-spirit-of-sodankyla-always-works-its-magic/,Peter von Bagh: the Spirit of Sodankylä always works its magic,"Peter von Bagh, the ‘grand old man’ of Finnish film, has been at the helm of the legendary Midnight Sun Film Festival in Sodankylä since its very beginning in 1986. Each year the film fest’s unique spirit attracts the most coveted names of the motion pictures world to Lapland. The   in Sodankylä, celebrated for the 28th time in June, has become one of the most unique festivals anywhere. Famous directors, upcoming hot names and ordinary people meet north of the Arctic circle, under the midnight sun and in a relaxed atmosphere. “The festival has hardly changed at all, because the concept hit the bull’s eye right from the start,” says von Bagh. “Naturally each event is still unique as performers and guests change all the time.” Von Bagh says he is happy about every film-related anniversary, every screened film, every guest and every visitor. Constant highlights include the annual silent film shows accompanied by live music and morning discussion sessions with the headliner guests, chaired by von Bagh himself. There are screenings at the festival 24 hours a day in four venues. “The main thing is the love of film,” von Bagh explains. “We have no rigid formalities and dispense with unnecessary frills, anything that is superfluous or beside the point. There is no other equally uncompromising event focusing purely on film, nor is it possible to have such a genuine taste of film specialties anywhere else in the world.” “Even though the format and spirit of the festival have remained the same, audience numbers have grown,” von Bagh continues. “This summer we reached around 30 000 visitors. Most of them are just ordinary Finns whose curiosity and intelligence charms our foreign guests.” Von Bagh is proud of the Midnight Sun Film Festival’s guest list. Everyone who has been invited has come, sooner or later – and then some. This year’s director guest, for example, was    , the maker of  ,   and many others films. The visit had been under discussion for as many as 21 years. “In 2002       invited himself here when we organisers hadn’t dared ask the busy man to participate. This says something about the attraction and spirit of Sodankylä.” Not so many people in Finland have noticed that von Bagh has also been artistic director of the Cineteca di Bologna festival in Italy in 2011. “No one has asked about this before, so thank you. There are only a couple of weeks between Sodankylä and Bologna, so it’s a challenge to change the cassette inside your head, but both festivals were successes once again,” says von Bagh cheerfully. Von Bagh received the noted Mel Novikoff Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival in May for his achievements as a festival director, film critic, author and professor, maker of films and TV programmes and head of film archives. A street in Sodankylä has been named after Peter von Bagh, also referred to one of Finland’s ‘national treasures’, and celebrating his 70th birthday this year."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/flow-has-the-power-to-attract/,Flow has the power to attract,"Now in its 10th year, Flow music and city-culture festival – which takes place in August – is always organised in high spirits and features the freshest acts. As well as music, the four-day Helsinki-fest also offers visual arts, cinema, design and food culture. Flow is both a state of mind and a physical state, where emotion flows collectively through music as part of a bigger entity. Having been firmly established in the Finnish festival calendar,   has grown 10 times in size over its 10-year history. As with last year, some 60 000 revellers are expected to be in attendance in Suvilahti, Helsinki. “Flow has evolved naturally according to demand,” explains press officer  . “This year we’re celebrating our 10th anniversary in keeping with the founding principles of the festival, but we’re also constantly bringing in new elements.” “Since the very beginning, the festival’s founders have wanted to put on the kind of event that they themselves would want to attend,” Hulkkonen says. “This spirit is still very much alive.” With its former industrial power station surroundings, the Helsinki district of Suvilahti provides an interesting setting for a complete festival experience. Even just this urban venue sets Flow apart from many of the traditional ‘field festivals’. The list of performers shows a contemporary selection of Finnish and international acts from indie rock to soul to jazz and from world music to the freshest dance tunes. Flow wants to break the traditional festival mold and offer up music and much more besides. “At Flow, we also highlight the importance of areas such as food culture,” Hulkkonen points out. “On-site we’ll have more than 20 real restaurants, offering delicious foods from all around the world, from local, organic dishes to Asian fusion cuisine.” There are more than a hundred music acts alone. Internationally, the best-known acts include  , The Knife,   & the Bad Seeds and the Kraftwerk 3D Show. In terms of internationally-acclaimed home-grown Finnish talent, there will be sets from Black Lizard, K-X-P and Husky Rescue. Hulkkonen says that Flow has gained a great reputation internationally. Around half of the accredited media representatives at this year’s festival will travel from around the world, with the majority of media interest coming from Russia, the UK, Germany and Estonia. “It’s always fun to read foreign articles where they’re amazed at how a festival of this class can be organised in Finland,” Hulkkonen says. Festival-goers are encouraged to travel to the venue by bike, on foot or on public transport instead of their own cars. Any modern festival has to be environmentally sustainable. Electricity is produced as much as possible using wind power, the organisers are very conscious of the festival’s carbon footprint and equipment made from recycled and durable materials is preferred. There will be no parking spaces for cars, meaning that festival-goers will have to come to the venue on foot, by bike or on public transport. “We will have around 700 volunteers. We had more applicants than ever before and we weren’t even able to offer everyone a job. For many, Flow represents the high-point and gentle descent into the darkness of autumn,” concludes Hulkkonen."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/oulu-a-miracle-in-the-making/,Oulu – a miracle in the making,"Oulu, dubbed the Capital of Northern Scandinavia, has set its sights on becoming globally competitive, diversely entrepreneurial and an urban business centre that creates jobs and exports. The city is well on its way to achieving that vision. The Midnight Pitch Fest, to take place in Oulu on the 22 and 23 August, is a current example of the efforts being made to boost people’s interest in the city as an investment target. The event is expected to draw in roughly 1 000 revellers. “Some 80 startup companies will pitch their operations, and close to 100 investors, not just from Finland, but also from Russia, Norway, Sweden, Central Europe and the US, will be on hand for the event,” says Juha Ala-Mursula. “In addition, more than a dozen world-class business leaders and entrepreneurs will speak at the event.” “Oulu has always had a strong culture of entrepreneurship,” says  , director of  . “Over the past 15 years, Nokia has attracted a number of talented people to its ranks, but now, as a result of the change in the company’s strategy, there is a considerable workforce in the region with a high level of competence, and many highly capable actors have begun to tackle business ideas that have been brewing for a long time,” Ala-Mursula explains. BusinessOulu is a city-owned enterprise responsible for implementing the city’s industrial policies and for providing development services required by companies. Its objective is to create a business environment that promotes the creation, operation, growth and competitiveness of companies, and which improves employment in the region. According to Ala-Mursula, the breakthrough in Oulu’s startup scene dates back to the mid-1980s, when several dozen new companies launched operations in the city. Things slowed down in the ‘90s, but picked up again in 2007. Since then, hundreds of companies have been started up in Oulu, creating a dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship in the city, where foreign companies already number roughly 200. “Within just two years we have managed to triple the number of investments,” says a pleased Ala-Mursula. Oulu boasts several strong areas of competence. From a global perspective, its mobile communications engineering and manufacturing is very strong, both in terms of products and services. Considerable business is also being carried out in health and welfare technology. Other strong areas are cleantech, mining technology and the combination of life sciences and bioindustry. The city is sufficiently large in terms of its offering, but also small enough to operate effectively. “We are accustomed to doing things quickly,” Ala-Mursula says. “The city is sufficiently large in terms of its offering, but also small enough to operate effectively. We know one another well and are able to seamlessly accomplish things across boundaries. Oulu, in fact, boasts the youngest age demographic in Europe. Oulu, which has earned the nickname the Capital of Northern Scandinavia, was ranked among the seven most intelligent cities in the world in 2012 by Intelligent Community Forum (ICF). Ala-Mursula believes there are many factors behind the ‘Oulu – Capital of the North’ brand: Oulu is the most populous city in northern Scandinavia, and contains the biggest university in the region, the most diverse trade and industry, a colourful cultural scene, and Finland’s second-busiest airport. It is also a popular tourist destination. “Becoming, according to ICF, Europe’s most intelligent city and the seventh most intelligent city in the world has been a long process,” Ala-Mursula says. “Oulu has always been very open to business, technology and development. We also have very good co-operation between companies, universities and public actors. On a monthly basis we devise ways to do things more efficiently, better and faster.” “The outcome of that process is that today we are seeing two and a half times more inventions in the region than, for example, in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area; we also have more entrepreneurship, and the balance of trade in the region is favourable. We are on the right development track.” Ala-Mursula concludes."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/building-mobile-momentum-in-the-healthcare-sector/,Building mobile momentum in the healthcare sector,"Oulu-based iSTOC has rolled mobile technology, machine vision, rapid diagnostics and cloud services all into one. The result is a package that brings significant savings to the healthcare sector and also has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in developing countries.  Born to be global, iSTOC provides rapid diagnostics with a mobile application. End uses vary from home care to the monitoring of major epidemics. The technology company with a Nokia background has what it takes to make it: an abundance of expertise, cutting-edge technology and global markets. “Our expertise stems from Nokia’s mobile health technology and business solutions from 2008–2012 when we came to realise that this holds major business potential,” says  ’s CEO  . “The technology in itself is not new, but when combined with rapid diagnostics, machine vision, mobile technology and cloud services, it leads to innovative applications,” Järvenpää says. Thanks to iSTOC’s innovation, various rapid diagnostics services can be easily transformed into user-friendly mobile services. All you need is a smartphone with a camera and a rapid test that can be done at home, for example. “The application, which can be downloaded to iPhone and Android smartphones, makes sure that the image is taken automatically and the test result is sent to the recipient, such as a doctor, through a cloud service,” Järvenpää explains. “The test result is interpreted remotely and the feedback is sent to the phone. If the illness requires treatment with antibiotics, for example, the doctor sends an electronic prescription to a pharmacy. In a healthcare centre, a nurse can take a blood sample from a patient to test for CRP levels, after which the image can be sent to the other side of the globe, if needed. The remote doctor then makes a diagnosis and determines the treatment. “With the help of machine vision and mobile technology, the result of the rapid test is stored in digital form and transmitted to an Internet server where it is easy to process further with other patient data,” Järvenpää says. “In future, the diagnostics, services and data transmission related to medical treatment will form a seamless process which also emphasises the patient’s independent initiative. The application can be utilised broadly in both developed and developing countries. It offers a lot of opportunities for public healthcare and home use alike. According to Järvenpää, influenza tests are one example of tests that can be performed at home in the same way as pregnancy tests. “There are tens of widely spread diseases in the world that can be analysed using rapid diagnostics and mobile applications,” Järvenpää says. “The test reveals in real-time diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, epidemic nephropathy and HIV positivity. Thanks to the technology, treatment is available even in the jungle or in a remote village with no doctor.” The service is currently being tested in Finland, Africa and the United States. Product solutions are also being developed for India and the Latin America. The business has massive scalability possibilities, as smartphones are becoming more commonplace. “Our co-operation with our strategic partners has got off to a good start and we have received positive feedback,” Järvenpää says. “At the end of next year, the business should have gained good momentum.”"
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/an-extra-boost-for-growth-companies/,An extra boost for growth companies,"Oulu is currently experiencing a major boom in entrepreneurship. Within just a few years, the city has become a globally unparalleled ecosystem propelling startup companies to success. The results are promising. The Oulu Business Accelerator was launched last year to boost the progress of startup companies seeking fast-paced international growth. “While there is an abundance of professional competence in Oulu, there is not necessarily a lot of experience of entrepreneurship. There was a clear social call for an accelerator, so we responded to the demand,” says  , head coach for the Oulu Business Accelerator, which is funded by   and the Centre for Economic Development. According to Kaikkonen, it can take a startup company typically a year to a year-and-a-half after conceiving an idea and assembling a team before the company is ready to take on capital investments. With the help of the Accelerator programme, the goal is to shorten that initial phase to six months. The Accelerator operating model was put to the test last winter during a pilot phase that involved companies focused on printed intelligence. A wider spectrum of ICT companies is currently taking part in a second pilot, and a third pilot will start up in January 2014. “Companies will initially be coached in an intensive 12-week-long programme,” Kaikkonen says. “In a second, equally long phase, the companies will engage in sounding-board sessions according to their needs and situation. The experiences thus far have been positive: the companies have made progress and capital financing has been secured.” “Within three years, we can generally see whether the companies will take off,” Kaikkonen explains. “Growth entrepreneurship is a difficult field, but there are some promising undertakings and teams. I’m convinced we will hear more about these companies in future.” BusinessKitchen also supports startups in various phases of their development. Along with the Business Accelerator, startup companies that are in various phases of development also receive support in Oulu from  ,   and Takomo. In addition, the ecosystem is supplemented by the services offered by BusinessOulu, Northern StartUp Fund, the University of Oulu’s Oulu Entrepreneurship Center and local business angels. “All of this forms a complete package that is unparalleled – even on a global level,” says  , who heads Starttaamo and serves as its chairman of the Board. Starttaamo celebrated its second anniversary in May. Its creation can be attributed to some issues identified at the same time among many startup companies, such as a lack of suitable office space, the need for peer support, the emergence and spread of startup events and networks in the region, the financial situation, the attitude of entrepreneurs, and the desire to work in close co-operation. “Peer support is, in our view, a unique aspect of the whole package, and it can speed up a company’s operations and help it to avoid pitfalls and bad decisions or contacts,” Polo stresses. Polo estimates that capital financing has been secured to the tune of some 20 million euros. The exact figure will be known in the autumn, when a few ongoing and rather sizeable investment rounds are concluded. Among Starttaamo’s more notable and larger members are Valkee, iLoq, Bitbar and Vibsolas. “Compared to most countries and other organisations, we have excellent opportunities in Oulu to churn out international success stories,” reckons Polo."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/pitch-perfect/,Pitch perfect,"The Midnight Pitch Fest, organised for the first time in Oulu at the end of August, brought together startups, investors, music, audience and a festival atmosphere. The event, aimed at boosting the profile of entrepreneurs, lived up to the expectations of its organisers. Pitching means presentations by startup entrepreneurs through which they sell their ideas to financiers. In Oulu the pitchers competed in front of judges, with just three minutes to impress them. The pitcher defines the problem or issue that requires a solution and explains how his or her company can solve it. In addition, they explain who would be ready to pay for the product, present their team and outline what the investor will get in return for their investment. The aim is to impress not only the judges but also the investors in the audience. “  is a new festival-style startup event where fledgling growth companies can present their operations,” says the event’s prime mover   from BusinessOulu. “The event is open to all and its aim is to boost the profile of entrepreneurs, enable financiers to meet startup companies and entrepreneurs as well as to have fun.” “The idea came about through a conversation I had with an entrepreneur at the airport one day,” Heikkinen explains. “We wanted to up the image of entrepreneurship because companies that wish to achieve growth are also the ones creating jobs. The conversation took off and we were left with the elements needed to organise the event.” The two-day pitch fest, i.e. presentation event for startup companies looking for funding, brought together an audience of around 1 000, nearly 50 Finnish and international professional investors and some 70 startup companies. The event attracted an unusually global crowd to Oulu with participants arriving from Sweden, Germany, the UK, Silicon Valley, Russia and Hong Kong. The event was composed of keynote speeches, pitches, presentations and music in tune with the festival spirit, which was provided by Redrama, a Finnish rapper who performs in English, and the band Mr. Hyde from Oulu. “The combination of startups, entrepreneurs, financiers, entertainment, seminars and a festival spirit worked well,” says a clearly satisfied Heikkinen. “The feedback we received proves it. We met and even exceeded the goals we had set for the festival.” What significance did the pitch fest hold for the entrepreneurs and companies that were its focal point? “The financiers reviewed the offering and identified their targets,” Heikkinen says. “As a result, several companies found themselves potential financiers. The negotiations are, of course, still in the early stages, so only the future will tell what the results will be. The entire event was non-profit and organised by volunteers. For example, all of the awards and grants presented to the companies were financed using ticket proceeds. Among the companies receiving awards were Trividi, which designs healthcare devices and equipment, Havina Productions, specialising in language learning games, Uros, a mobile services company, and Alpakka Media, which offers traditional stories for children through modern media. Although the festival has only just ended, the organisers are already planning next year’s event, mapping out venues and trying to find the perfect time slot. According to Heikkinen, there is clear demand for the festival."
http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/major-market-for-mobile-money/,Major market for mobile money,"In emerging markets, mobile phones are commonplace, but bank accounts are not. Oulu-based Mistral Mobile has developed a solution that enables safe money transfers and payments using a mobile phone, regardless of the operator. In addition to promoting business, the solution enhances welfare.  was formed in 2012, when Nokia decided to withdraw from the Indian mobile payment market after a three-year trial period. Thanks to the new technology developed by the company, banking services can be delivered and accessed through just a mobile phone. “Typically, banks operating in emerging markets must rely on technology that is dependent on operators for their mobile offering, because 95 per cent of consumers only have a voice and SMS connection,” explains senior vice president, Product Marketing,  . “The technology we have developed on the basis of several software packages uses the SMS channel as the data transmission channel,” Ollikainen explains. “Once data security is ensured, the mobile phone can be used for all banking services, from money transfers to loan management. The emerging markets offer enormous market potential. The number of mobile phone users is estimated globally at over 3 billion, and the number of mobile phone connections at up to 6 billion. However, more than 2.5 billion people do not have access to banking services. “Our applications can be run by all users, even those who only have a voice and SMS connection,” Ollikainen says. “We also offer solutions to retailers serving as banking agents i.e. so called bank offices, which are common in Asia and Africa in particular.” Mistral Mobile is currently conducting negotiations in Africa, Asia and South America. The objective of our negotiation partners is to make the services available to tens of millions of consumers during the next few years. “The objective of our negotiation partners is to make the services available to tens of millions of consumers during the next few years,” Ollikainen says. “As far as we know, no similar technology exists today,” Ollikainen says. “We have several patents pending. Our opportunities for success stem from, among other things, the respect shown for Finnish technology in growth markets, while our Nokia background also plays a major role.” It is possible that the business will take off over the next few years, but it still requires hard work and traveling around the world. According to Ollikainen, negotiations in the banking sector are lengthy, and market penetration involves a number of different steps. “We have been conducting negotiations with several actors since last year,” Ollikainen says. “We have sown many seeds while at the same time building our network. The technology has already been in pilot use with global actors in the financial sector and local actors in certain countries.” Mistral Mobile’s goals reach beyond making money. The new technology can bring major benefits to individuals and society alike. “Through our technology, many consumers will have access to banking services for the first time in their lives, as normal banking services are beyond their reach,” Ollikainen says. “In addition, the new payment services provide a way to eradicate the grey economy and bribery, which usually take place in the form of cash transactions.” “Mobile money also provides traceability, which means that state subsidy payments, for example, can be made directly to the recipient without any intermediaries,” Ollikainen points out."
